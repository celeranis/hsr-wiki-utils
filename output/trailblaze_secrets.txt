:'''Origin Universe:''' Don't forget you're playing as Akivili. Turning into a mortal and hiding in the crowd is what you do best. Don't worry. Just close your eyes and relax your limbs, and you will find your senses in the middle of a gallery of a plethora of colors... Then, you start browsing the changing scenes quickly...
:'''Origin Universe:''' You open your eyes and find yourself in Lepismat, where there's no humanity but a swarm of flat insects crawling at your feet. Your instinct screams at you, telling you that this is the beginning of everything! However, you realize that strange and anachronistic items constantly appear and are calculated into being from the loopholes in the Simulated Universe. For example, a manuscript copy of the research of {{Color|Keyword|Finality}} composed by Genius Society member #? has unfolded automatically before you.
:'''Origin Universe:''' You calm down and observe it, knowing that the end of all things is recorded in it. The scribbling writes, "...Tayzzyronth, an Aeon that ascends amid hatred and loneliness. From the words {{Color|Keyword|the Finality}} mutters in their sleep, Tayzzyronth's death predetermines their birth. Throughout their whole life, they will be imprisoned in the Path of Propagation. If you're interested, you can learn about its abnormality, its separation, and how it is played by fate..."
:'''Origin Universe:''' This page of the manuscript starts burning by itself after you finish reading it. It carries out a strict self-destruction procedure. The next page contains a handwriting that is even more messy. You believe it will burn after you read it, too...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Remembrance Small.png|20}} Review those geniuses' manuscripts. &mdash; It's not like research reports can just jump up and hit you, unless, of course, you secretly want them to?
:::'''Origin Universe:''' A genius left behind a manuscript before being murdered by Polka Kakamond. His writing style is as vague as his speech: "A—An Omen Van—Vanguard successfully interpreted the somniloquy of the Finality, those words sounding like an enigma being played backwards? ...He then traveled around only to share his findings with others... Th—There are no means to find out... whether the Omen Vanguard's action was effectiv-ve..."
:::'''Origin Universe:''' "Th—That darn fictitious pills... It claimed... to be able to cure... stuttering disorder... caused by lack of self-confidence... Now... even my writing is... af—affected..."
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Destruction Small.png|20}} Let's burn them up! &mdash; Burn before reading!
:'''Origin Universe:''' As you look elsewhere, the manuscript suddenly jumps and gives your head a *punch*! You are dumbfounded! Before you know it, it is back to where it was lying again.
:'''Origin Universe:''' You wonder whether you were hallucinating just now.

:'''Swarm Universe:''' When you look up, you find yourself on an isolated island with coconut trees and ocean currents. The inhabitants are dressed in animal hide in the most primitive form. Forced to live in isolation, it suddenly occurs to you that it is the *place of destiny*. The first world the Propagation descended upon after their ascension seemed to be predetermined. Several Amber Eras ago, this place was gradually isolated due to geographic and ocean current changes. Loneliness thickens, mixes, and stirs, and the island is like a handful of soil waiting to be sown.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You have nothing to do, and there is only an odd-looking flame on the wasteland before you. You put out the colorful flame with seawater, and a rather charred photo frame emerges... There is a drowned knife next to it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Remembrance Small.png|20}} Speak with the photo frame. &mdash; This is something you often do... Does everyone have that many friends?
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' There is something peculiar about this photograph that chimes an irresistible fear within you. As you gaze upon it, you detect how fate expresses itself: The Mandalan islanders draw on photos, creating colorful wings upon the image of their family members' shoulders. That multicolored flame erupting out is the representation of life itself. They connect and embrace each other with flames, culminating in the birth of new life.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' The Mandalan islanders use the continuation of life to resist the fear of loneliness and death - there is nothing else on this isolated island except love and loneliness... Regrettably, this flame will eventually be extinguished, and the island will end up being the initial breeding ground for the Swarm.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Destruction Small.png|20}} Make a small cut with a small knife! &mdash; You don't know why such a thought occurred, but you only live once!
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' A ravenous desire for Destruction smolders in your heart... stoked by your overwhelming fear of annihilation! Your right hand rises uncontrollably as an irresistible fear tinkles through you and forces you to make a decision to commit robbery...
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' However, as you touch the knife, countless souls who once caressed this blade appear and dissipate, and stories flood into your mind. For, out of the same fear, a one-armed father once wielded this very knife to protect his daughter. And yet, amidst the warfare that destroyed their village, the grown daughter ended her own life amidst the Swarm...
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' ...There is nothing else on this isolated island except love and loneliness... Regrettably, they will end up being the initial breeding ground for the Swarm.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' Anyone, no one will jump out and become your friend... You make a yawn.

:'''Ember Universe:''' On planet Zeus Tehtera, where the distinction between day and night has long been blurred by the all-encompassing darkness wrought by the Swarm, the residents have already resigned themselves to their doomed fate. However, the shroud of darkness suddenly lifts — and the light of dawn breaks through. A triumphant and exultant celebration ensues, lasting for three full natural days and nights. You join in the revelry halfway through, imbibing to your heart's content with the jubilant crowd for eighteen days and nights, until a realization dawns upon you: The daylight has persisted for far too long.
:'''Ember Universe:''' Your gaze falls upon a stone cabinet at the center of the ruins: Some stubborn souls are still clinging to the past.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Elation Small.png|20}} Give it a knock. &mdash; You are still waiting for him to come out of the stone closet.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' You politely knock on it and wait there for eleven whole natural months...
:::'''Ember Universe:''' In the end, you lose your patience and pull a naked man out of the cabinet, shouting, "Stop hiding! The Swarm is no more!"
:::'''Ember Universe:''' At that moment, a heartrending wail erupts from this miner from the support team, who then clings to the stone cabinet and cries for three days and nights. His grief is so profound that he and the cabinet seem like a pair of bitter lovers forced apart.
:'''Ember Universe:''' ...There's nothing wrong with living in the past.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Leave. &mdash; You feel disinclined to interrupt his time inside the closet.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' ...There's nothing wrong with living in the past.

:'''Origin Universe:''' You are no stranger to the sudden darkness that envelopes you... for you have experienced too many inexplicable things, time and time again... This time, three shadows appear before you. Those who have once lived and perished may occasionally appear here. Their features flicker and waver, at times taking the form of insects resembling Melchiez's adopted sons... Perhaps they possess different souls.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Destruction Small.png|20}} A certain nobleman once recorded before he fell into a crazed state... &mdash; You're starting to feel a little *crazy* too.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' "The formidable army spawned by the self-replication and division of the Sand King originates from the Lepismat system. Some units of the Swarm have transformed into ground combat units... They have sacrificed flight for colossal size and hardened carapaces... These units often serve as the shock troops of the Swarm Invasion, using their massive bodies to break through defenses..."
:::'''Origin Universe:''' You have become madder.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} A certain traveler with an active imagination murmurs to himself behind the glass wall after being confined... &mdash; You try to enter his mind.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' "I have seen wonders beyond the scope of human imagination... I have seen dozens of insects intertwine and give birth to entirely new offspring, which in turn weave themselves together like a shape-shifting rose with countless interlocking petals. The reproductive cycle of the Swarm is akin to a flower emitting pheromones and various scents... a breathtaking combination of monstrosity and beauty..."
:::'''Origin Universe:''' Understanding someone else's thoughts is never an easy task... You are starting to get drowsy.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Elation Small.png|20}} A piece of evidence left behind by a certain Armed Archaeologist before they were murdered... &mdash; You feel sorry.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' "Lepismat was once a site of flourishing biodiversity, where insects of multiple biological sexes may have coexisted with each serving their own unique functions within the Swarm. However, it remains unclear which branches of the Swarm were responsible for reproduction during this era. However, at some point, the ancient insects gradually drifted toward the brink of extinction."
:::'''Origin Universe:''' You are more curious about why he was murdered... But unfortunately, it seems he doesn't care about himself.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Leave. &mdash; Looks like Herta needs to do some bug fixing for the Simulated Universe.

:'''Swarm Universe:''' At the hospital on Mandalan Island, your ears are filled with raucous cries... The number of newborns has peaked at an all-time high. In the days that follow, they rushed out of the isolated island, and as a result, Swarms emerge in the skies all over Lapole Major.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You hold out with the doctors at the hospital for twenty-one days until the Lapole Major government officially announces the planet's fall and requests interstellar rescue. As transport ships arrive to evacuate the first batch of survivors, you hear whispers among some of the refugees, urging a distraught woman to flee the area. She refuses to open the door, and her window lies shattered.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' Driven by a sudden urge, you leap through the broken window and give her a good grimace! For her, this will be a *better* solace than those fools' comforting words.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' She is startled by your bold move! For a moment, you're unsure who is the *madder* one between you and the woman. Satisfied, you glance around the room and spot the toddler shoes scattered on the floor, a heartbreaking revelation of the woman's cruel fate...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Abundance Small.png|20}} Tell her about the fate that she must accept. &mdash; Her children have all left, which also means they will never return.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' She winces... as if her blood has stopped flowing through her veins. Then, she asks you to leave.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' Later, on the twenty-fourth night of the Swarm Invasion, she discovers an insect crawling through a slit in her window and raises it as her own child. She teaches it to walk, to put on shoes, and even to speak with all her heart. Seven days later, her house becomes flooded with her new offspring... although none of them can put on shoes for themselves.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} It's better to seal the window up. &mdash; You are unwilling to tell her what you saw.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' You accept the woman's reprimand in silence and take this chance to seal the broken windows in her room before leaving.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' Later, on the twenty-fourth night of the Swarm Invasion, she raises an insect that comes in through a slit on her window as her own child. She teaches it how to walk, how to put on shoes, and even how to speak with all her heart and so. Seven days later, her house is flooded with her heirs... although none of them can put on shoes for themselves.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You rub your feet uneasily, sadly reaffirmed about your ability to move your own feet.

:'''Ember Universe:''' The calamity has ultimately ceased, or at least one must believe so. Ahead lies only those tending to the psychological needs of survivors, their ashen visages not unlike the ruins of their forlorn city now deprived of its former glory in the wake of the apocalypse.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Abundance Small.png|20}} Participate in the psychological intervention and assistance work after the catastrophic swarm in the Elothean Empire. &mdash; You will also become slightly *hurt*.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' The psychological assistance center of Elothea is seeking temporary helpers. While there will be no payment, the satisfaction of aiding those in need will be rewarding enough on its own.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' Out of love, you harden your heart and bury it.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} Sitting beside the 14th Emperor and helping him equivocate and embellish... &mdash; Narration itself is just a fancy sensory trick...
:::'''Ember Universe:''' Making up stories is your forte. As the Fourteenth Emperor gazes skyward, watching the Swarm retreat, he implores you to document the phenomenon. Inventing twelve distinct explanations for the ebbing Swarm, you fabricate twelve different versions of prophecies in response to this omen. In the years that follow, the prophecies you created become popular among the trendy Ptarmigans, who use them as a means to divine their character and destiny, masking their unease about the capricious future.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' You have become a master astrologer without effort!
:'''Ember Universe:''' Merely staying alive is traumatic in itself.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Leave. &mdash; You are in a hurry.

:'''Origin Universe:''' The scent of blood pierces your nostrils, jolting you awake! You find yourself amidst an unprecedented massacre and the onset of all that was to follow. If only everything could halt at this instant, but regrettably, no one can freeze the passage of time...
:'''Origin Universe:''' You caress the Elydichnan army insignia affixed to your chest... Your regiment has just erupted into conflict with bounty hunters... And yes, you know well that you are on Lepismat, for where else would you be surrounded by countless sandworms?
:'''Origin Universe:''' You discern that certain insects are being utilized by the army as weapons due to their self-replication features. Some insects are reproducing on the battlefield like a legion that regenerates infinitely, while some colossal insects are purging the surface of all hostile entities.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} I will put down my gun. &mdash; This is not what I want to do.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' You think you can stay out of this? Think again! You must learn to defend yourself... both on the battlefield and in your life.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Destruction Small.png|20}} I wanna populate my insectoid index! &mdash; It's just a simulation game!
:::'''Origin Universe:''' Yes, you have to convince yourself that this is not a game.
:'''Origin Universe:''' Death surrounds you, with corpses of both humans and insects littering the landscape. It's better to be the hunter than the prey! But to your amazement, in the midst of the battle, the Swarm abruptly ceases its flight and begins to reproduce. This moment may herald the advent of a new age of cosmic organisms! You never imagined that such a wondrous sight could occur right before your eyes.
:'''Origin Universe:''' Trembling, you suddenly spot the last of the Coleoptera on Lepismat, which hurtles into the sky with a shattered carapace and trails of mucus, leaving behind the chaos, carnage, and the unending flames of war. An otherworldly entity appears to be observing everything with its colossal eye.

Suddenly, you notice a wooden hut that is familiar to you. You recall seeing it once, a long, long time ago when its windows were obscured by snow and its wooden shingles exuded the scent of pine nuts.

:'''Origin Universe:''' When the "uncivilized" Lepismat system was first discovered by "civilization," the planet's surface teemed with swarms of insects. A leader gazed upon the star charts on the screen, relishing in the momentous occasion. He directed his attention towards Lepismat, awash in elation.
:'''Origin Universe:''' This leader... has always managed to succeed against all odds, and his triumphs have filled him with avarice, hubris, and an unwavering belief that he can conquer any planet and erect unprecedented civilizations. While he can get whatever he desires... he has never discovered what he really wants.
:'''Origin Universe:''' Now, he extends an invitation to you, something he rarely offers. He admires you, a navigator who composes poetry in your spare time. The curiosity for destiny is not just a butterfly that alights on your fingertips, but also on his.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} I will join. &mdash; A rare opportunity... You are willing to sacrifice some personal time for this.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' He discloses a secret: He is afflicted with a peculiar ailment that allows him to only retain memories of the most recent three days. The leader requests a favor of you: to document certain whispers about Lepismat and remind him of them every three days. At that moment, you realize that this will be the greatest moment of your life. You will become his right-hand man and serve as his second mind.
:'''Origin Universe:''' At the next landing, you will arrive in Lepismat. His eyes gleam... and you are aware that he has believes in the half-deciphered whispers that were played in reverse. {{Color|Keyword|"He conquers planets. He establishes civilizations. He finds his lost self."}}

Upon seeing you, he glares viciously, and you follow his gaze to the Memory Bubble hovering in front of the gondola. He swallows hard and extends his hand towards it!

You have no idea which dimension the noise can be sourced from, but it sounds akin to a cacophonous carol with booming, whimpering, and laughter combined with hymns arranged in parallel. Everyone except you succumbs to the noise, falling into a state of ecstasy as if they have witnessed divine revelations. Despite your attempts to stop them, they follow the rhythm and pound the Memory Bubble in the dust until it cracks!

[[File:Trailblaze Secret 5.png|thumb|right|175px]]
{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' The various factions are divided in their support of the Gods. Throughout this entire fiasco, you all have been twisting and turning, hemming and hawing, ingratiating yourselves with one another while trying to backstab each other the next moment! You make navigational changes on a whim in the dead of night, and revel in your shenanigans! Until one day, you unwittingly barge into the hallway of the Memory Zone, and a girl whose face you can't see wishes to gift you with a Memory Bubble — she claims a {{Color|Keyword|"shadow"}} is contained within.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Remembrance Small.png|20}} Accept it. &mdash; It was born of non-existence. Does it really exist?
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' Facing the light, you can't make out what exactly this "shadow" is sealed within. An... urge suddenly wells up within you. Yes... you've been curious for far too long. It's all right, Herta isn't looking...
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' ...You struggle with your thoughts for a bit, and finally... you can't help yourself... and you give it a lick! The Memory Bubble is cool, rubbery, but otherwise tasteless. Your tongue leaves a faint depression on the surface, which quickly fades back into its original state. Your curiosity is sated.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' You believe it has no calories.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Decline respectfully. &mdash; Don't accept things from strangers.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' Your guard against this *girl whose face you can't see* is on high alert. Faced against the light, you can't make out what exactly this "shadow" is sealed within.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' After the end of that intermission, you all resume your daily antics. That is, until you all get caught in a miasma of Insect wing powder and plunge into a state of delirium. In the ensuing chaos, a Nameless accidentally trips, does a full somersault, and hits the button that sends you all to the Elydichna Starzone.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' Later on, when people ask about the incident, the Nameless will reply: That was the most courageous decision he made in the name of the Trailblaze.

{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' Before the powerful hammering, whimpers and indecipherable words sound off, the Self-Annihilator with crooked ankles gazes upon you... He claims to have been alone in dialogue with the past for a long time, and that no traveler had ever stepped foot here.
:'''Ember Universe:''' He would be interrupted by sudden flashes of his memory, and temporarily stop talking, before raising his head to recollect his train of thought. He hands you a cloth written full of words... This is a memoir written by a Navigator who loves poems.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Remembrance Small.png|20}} Put the fragments back together. &mdash; You keep feeling a sense of familiarity with this... Have you done something like this before?
:::'''Ember Universe:''' A worm who lets out a bellowing laugh once rubbed shoulders with countless people. A soldier who's trying to kill himself thus gains "joy," which in turn becomes the desire to live. But the joy that a mere single worm can spread is limited; it is always fluctuating, diluting and coalescing in three days.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Elation Small.png|20}} Calm down the Self-Annihilator first. &mdash; You keep feeling a sense of familiarity with this... Have you done something like this before?
:::'''Ember Universe:''' You caress touch his arched back with your hand, and a creeping chill rises within you — this should be the land of Tayzzyronth's fated beginning and end, but there is only desolation here.
:'''Ember Universe:''' Just then, the Self-Annihilator stretches out his hand, gulping as if to keep some temptation at bay, and on the fourth day, he finally remembers the {{Color|Keyword|annihilation of self}}.

===Beyond the Sky Choir: Anomaly Archives (Part 1)===
[[File:Trailblaze Secret 4.png|thumb|right|175px]]
{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Origin Universe:''' When the ancient Order was still watching over all life in the universe, during a downpour, a young man once barged into the sacred and silent stone chamber. He used a slab of stone as a deity's seat, then took the angle of the seat's right angle as a posture to greet a God—
:'''Origin Universe:''' When he and his younger brother spread the song of their duet beyond the skies, he never imagined that he would thereafter be thrust into the role of the crown prince *bearing the crown* in the chaos. He would slay his brother, and the duet would forever have lost half of its voice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Sit on that chair. &mdash; Adjust the curvature of your waist to a right angle. Feel the "divine" sensation.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' You adjust your waist to a right angle. Your muscles start cramping up. This connection with God... It doesn't seem to have healed your waist, pained from working non-stop for credits...
:::'''Origin Universe:''' But you feel what it's like to sit straight!
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Abundance Small.png|20}} Join this choir. &mdash; You will become a *musical note*.
:::'''Origin Universe:''' You understand the new language... That young prisoner had silently permitted everything to happen before he walked to the guillotine... This is the secret language of love and hate between two brothers, a whisper without a beginning or end.
:'''Origin Universe:''' When all this ends, a dissonant interval is suddenly heard in the Beyond the Sky Choir's singing: It is said that this is when Order and Finality brush past each other.

{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' The Beyond the Sky Choir's singing was being muffled out by the high walls, thus becoming a source of dispute with the Architects, until a young singer tragically fell into the sea after climbing over the wall with his elder brother using the *inseparable* deception...
:'''Swarm Universe:''' ...His sacrifice marked the end of this farcical dispute.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' And a crowd was kneeling by the shore, expressing their thanks for the drowned, even if they still don't know *which one* of the twins it was.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} Kneel in a straight angle next to the shore. &mdash; Are you willing to be devout...
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' The waters of sea before you is akin to a silken sheet of glass blades unendingly rising and falling. It is a swarmless, serene sight beneath the waters... Your hand is cut by a strange force, but you already establish resonance with the ancient Order using the "right angle."
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} Devote yourself to saving him! &mdash; You are too late.
:::'''Swarm Universe:''' You also jump into the sea with a resounding splash! Your vision underwater is muddled, but you can see kaleidoscopic rays of light enshrouding the drowned — after his death, the drowned would be known for having the most moving and holy of voices that ever harmonized for gods in the ancient era.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You exude a heartfelt smile: Mortals would only be exalted in death, no matter how they lived.

[[File:Trailblaze Secret 4.png|thumb|right|175px]]
{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' Countless worlds untouched by Qlipoth's graces recorded when the light of Order faded like the radiance of old empires: Their suns had once disappeared, a statue of an entangled pair of twins appeared in the sky, like an omen of a coming long night...
:'''Ember Universe:''' And when Tayzzyronth fell and the Swarm withdrew, the sun was gently returned.
:'''Ember Universe:''' "For Equilibrium." A voice suddenly calls out to you overhead, but it does not hope for your response.
:'''Herta:''' "What is that voice?" Herta's figure suddenly appears, "(Trailblazer), what did you see?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} For Equilibrium! &mdash; The Universe requires equilibrium.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' "For Equilibrium." A voice suddenly calls out to you overhead. You hear a sliver of praise, "For Equilibrium."
::{{Icon/Dark|Path The Hunt Small.png|20}} Can I refuse Equilibrium? &mdash; The Simulated Universe may not require... equilibrium.
:::'''Ember Universe:''' "For Equilibrium." You detect the tinge of a secret from that emotionless tone, "Equilibrium has already happened."
:'''Ember Universe:''' You can only feel the phenomenon unfold before you — Their decisions are never arbitrary, for they gently guide the angle of return.
:'''Screwllum:''' "Anomaly detected outside of system design." Screwllum's voice reassures you, "But it is of no danger, (Trailblazer). The Simulated Universe needs Equilibrium. I, Herta and Ruan Mei are here with you."
:'''Herta:''' "No, I'm not." Herta sulkily says, and then she's gone.

===The Architects: Annals of Fortification (Part 1)===
[[File:Trailblaze Secret 6.png|thumb|right|175px]]
{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Origin Universe:''' You encounter a giant Architect who is lounging lazily under the sun... You read some mottled carvings on the sole of his feet that read: They were called "Bigfeet" by humans. The sound that comes from his mouth is powerful, and you can't make out his words.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Elation Small.png|20}} Plant the Synesthesia Beacon on him. &mdash; Heh, let's give his beard a braid, and then insert the beacon there!
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Destruction Small.png|20}} Scratch his heel with the Synesthesia Beacon. &mdash; Even though it's hard to distinguish where his heels are...
:'''Origin Universe:''' He jumps to his feet with such force that it shakes the very earth! And he attempts to let out a sneeze, but you hastily stop him! This Architect claims they got a warning from the hammerings of Qlipoth, and are repairing the barriers of multiple star systems urgently. However, he knows not for what reason, and decides to pause what he is working on.
:'''Origin Universe:''' He uses a giant foot to stamp a crater in the ground, then invites you to rest in it together. You shake your head, sigh, and leave...

{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' The sound of beating wings smash through the Architects' walls, and the clash between them come to a close... A Bigfoot's wife chooses to leave the Architects' group, leaving for distant lands with the gondola.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You see a familiar Bigfoot Architect leaning against the base of the wall. He feebly laments his own poverty: he would always pick the cheapest hours to eat Nosewalkers grilled by the Furnace with his wife. To make ends meet, they could only live in a bastion room buried by bricks, enjoying scant moments of peace with each other. When they leave the bastion, the gondola just happened to be traversing this star system.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path The Hunt Small.png|20}} We meet again! &mdash; You are pretty familiar with him.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Abundance Small.png|20}} Wait with him. &mdash; You may need to wait a long while.
:'''Ember Universe:''' Time passes slowly. You lean in close to each other. Truly... there is only "waiting." Besides that, there is nothing else to do.
:'''Herta:''' "Time to go, (Trailblazer). Why aren't you still playing in the Simulated Universe?" Herta suddenly appears. She doesn't know what happened to you.
:'''Ember Universe:''' You wait a while longer, but nothing else happens... All that's left to do is to leave.

{{Dialogue_Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' You pass by the foot of the Architects' wall where a sturdy statue can be seen before the city — except it is breathing. His body is old and massive like a wall, his whiskers grown long as time itself. Travelers passing by thought of setting his beard on fire to clean him up, but he always declined their help.
:'''Ember Universe:''' Finally, he sees you and recognizes you as a familiar friend. His eyes shimmer with a faint ripple of shock, but as an ancient wall statue... he is already too decrepit to move his feet anywhere.
:'''Ember Universe:''' "Outsider... I've been waiting for you. The Trailblaze, I know you." He mumbles. This Architect has been awaiting the return of the gondola all this time, "Three times... I've met you. The Trailblaze can traverse stars for eternity. If you happen to meet her, could I ask you to help me tell her... not to go...?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Remembrance Small.png|20}} I can try. &mdash; You keep making promises you don't even know if you can keep.
::{{Icon/Dark|Path Nihility Small.png|20}} I don't think this is effective... &mdash; Poverty cannot separate people. Different ideals, however, can.
:'''Ember Universe:''' You bid him farewell... and make for the distant stars with his love in tow. He stays where he is... His language is one of an ancient wail: No one knows better than him that, in a sea of wild embers, waiting takes far longer than immortality itself.
