==Story==
{{Description|Another newborn breaks free from its cocoon. You can feel an itch and a gnawing pain under your skin. It nibbles away the subcutaneous tissue that gets in its way. The mixture of its gel-like secretions and the pus from the wounds solidifies on the inner walls of the nest, becoming the breeding ground of an immortal corpus.<br /><br />It wriggles slowly to shift its body to another direction. Just like countless of its peers, it pierces through the final layer of skin and worms its way out of its host. When you stroke it, feeling pleased for its birth, the milky-white larva lifts its head, bites your fingertip instinctively, and swallows the flesh and blood you feed it.<br /><br />What a familial feeling of pain! The soul snatch bees that fill your body numb your nerves with their venom, and their collective biting resembles an elegant concerto. You let out a maniacal laugh to celebrate your wonderful immortality.}}
