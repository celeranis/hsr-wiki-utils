==Story==
{{Description|You gently stir the ends of memory, extracting a strand of pain and then throwing it into an abandoned Memory Bubble tank. Having experienced separation from his beloved family in the Great Evacuation and the death of his long-kept intellitail songbird in the cage following a contaminant leak in the Kuvida Nebula, a depressed young man became withdrawn to the whole world and came to you, hoping to have his whole life deleted.<br /><br />You open the backup memory bank. Warriors heading to the battlefield and travelers on an expedition gave you their memories in return for your treatment. Meticulously, you select the suitable medicine and mix them according to the correct proportion. An unbreakable promise, the determination to rebuild broken homes, and insignificant changes are enough to embolden a person to overcome reality. As he embarks on the journey to reunite with his family, you close the door and take a short break.}}
