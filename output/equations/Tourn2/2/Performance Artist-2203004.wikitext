==Story==
{{Description|Those lunatic performance artists are Amphoreus' greatest disgrace.<br />They galavant city-to-city to spread clownish manifestos.<br />Stophantones, their ringleader, is a third-rate comedy actor<br />who delusively believes that wars could be substituted with comedies, and won based on who earns the loudest laughters.<br />At Castrum Kremnos' arena festival, they quipped at their opponents,<br />only to be met with a fist. Curtains closed before the punchline.<br />In Ladon, their preposterous poses during their performances<br />were seen as an insult to the Eye of Twilight, and nearly had them tossed off the cliff.<br />But Stophantones blames failure on "poor comedic timing."<br />Well, in my opinion, their existence is quite a fine comedy.}}
