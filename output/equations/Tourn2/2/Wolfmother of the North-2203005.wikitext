==Story==
{{Description|Forget stories of a hero slaying a beast. I am going to tell you something else.<br />Meet Vostrozh &mdash; a female wolf who manipulates blizzards and snow in the north.<br />She suckled seven exiled human princes, taking them in as foster sons,<br /> and taught them her wisdom and cunning.<br />But their father was a tyrant who was paranoid that his sons would usurp the throne.<br />Thus, he had them exiled.<br />When soldiers came butchering, the she-wolf died shielding her seven human cubs.<br />The princes survived and, alongside their supporters, dethroned their father years later.<br />Yes &mdash; You may have guessed that they became the legendary Seven Kings of the North.<br />The moral of the story? Humans can be more bestial than beasts.}}
