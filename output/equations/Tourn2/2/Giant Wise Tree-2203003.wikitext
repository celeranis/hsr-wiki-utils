==Story==
{{Description|Ever visited the southern pondering woods? It was once home to a sacred tree,<br />which possessed far more wisdom than humans, and had countless disciples kneeling at its roots.<br />It even dared to claim to be more knowledgeable than Cerces,<br />enraging the Grove of Epiphany. Yet the sages who came forth to debate were all defeated.<br />The sacred tree shook its lush leaves, oozing arrogance.<br />As the smartest being on land, it was certain it could even parse celestial equations.<br />Sturdy branches clawed at the heavens, leaving an endlessly long shadow upon the earth<br />till lightning cleaved it the moment it penetrated the highest rain clouds.<br />Now what remains of the forest is only embers and ashes.<br />If you wish for wisdom, seek its incinerated branches.}}
