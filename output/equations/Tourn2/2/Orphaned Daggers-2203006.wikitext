==Story==
{{Description|Some children are unfortunately born as tools for vengeance.<br />Orphaned Daggers, they're called. A name that breathes fear into everyone's hearts.<br />Poison vials for teething rings. Daggers for bedtime tales.<br />They inherited the skills of Amphoreus' finest assassins.<br />Taught until they were bought by schemers for dangerous and dirty work.<br />After all, what lord would fear an innocent child?<br />Utilizing this weakness, blades kissed necks like feathers.<br />When the guards came to their senses, they found two corpses,<br />one of which was the child themself, for this was why they had prepared the poison vial.<br />With their target perished, their existence no longer held any meaning.}}
