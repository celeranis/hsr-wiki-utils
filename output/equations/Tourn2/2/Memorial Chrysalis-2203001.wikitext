==Story==
{{Description|How do I know these tales? A secret for your ears&mdash;<br />the truth may sound ridiculous, but please believe my words.<br />I once adventured in distant woods and brought a giant golden chrysalis back with me,<br />its threads scattering daylight into an iridescent glow. An enchanting sight indeed.<br />Every third dawn, a prismatic butterfly emerges,<br />whirling around me as it flits in the air, unfolding visions of someone else's life before me.<br />I consulted one of Oronyx's priestesses, and she kept silent for a long while,<br />before stating that it was merely a miracle left behind by Era Chrysea.<br />I knew you'd give me that look.<br />If you're doubtful, just take this as my newly weaved story.}}
