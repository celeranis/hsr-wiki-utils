==Story==
{{Description|When I was young, I once saw a mighty eagle.<br />It flapped its wings, forged from steel and iron, and blanketed the sky.<br />With eyes blazing with fury, it gazed upon the earth below.<br />Its colossal claws, crafted from gold, gleamed like a second sun in the sky.<br />Later, I learned that this eagle was the natural enemy of the Coronal Phoenix.<br />In the twilight of my years, fate reunited me with the eagle.<br />Once the sovereign of the skies, it lay helpless on the ground, near death.<br />Its wings were pierced with holes, its eyes dimmed,<br />And even its golden claws were covered in the rust of time.<br />It appeared that the century-long hunt had come to an end,<br />As the mighty eagle succumbed to the relentless spawn of evil birds.<br />As I stood there mourning its fate, the eagle's body ignited in a fiery blaze,<br />And from within that golden flame, a rejuvenated form emerged, spreading its wings with renewed vigor.}}
