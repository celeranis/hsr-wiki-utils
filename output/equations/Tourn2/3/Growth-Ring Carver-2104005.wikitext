==Story==
{{Description|I understand you detest the conduct of the Engravers, but please allow me to plead on their behalf.<br />Heroes set out with lofty aspirations, only to return to a world of desolation.<br />They witnessed friends consumed by tsunamis and monsters piercing the chests of their kin.<br />In their hearts, all that remains is helplessness and despair.<br />Trees record history through their rings, while Engravers etch the past out of empathy and aspiration.<br />In their stories, aging heroes never embarked on their expeditions.<br />Lost friends either returned or were merely on a long journey.<br />The collapsed city still stood, sheltering bewildered elders<br />And children speaking the language of their homeland.<br />Through lies, they craft a fleeting dream for heroes trapped in the past.<br />Absurd as it may seem, it is indispensable for this era.}}
