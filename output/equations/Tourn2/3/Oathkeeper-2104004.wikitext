==Story==
{{Description|Hush, the Oathkeepers of Talanton are coming.<br />May you have lived your life with integrity and never broken an oath,<br />Be it a deal with a workshop, an alliance with a neighboring land,<br />A promise to the Titans, or a miracle prayed for in a temple.<br />The believers of Talanton are everywhere. They are the wind,<br />The shadows, and the shattered stone tablets.<br />They defend all contracts of the world on behalf of the Titans.<br />With daggers, they slay kings who betray allies.<br />With an eagle's beak, they punish gamblers who deceive the Titans.<br />With a rose, they wounded even the cunning Zagreus.<br />Some claim the Oathkeepers are merely the priests' lies,<br />But that is because one cannot see them until one dies.<br />No matter how much you evade, they will always be waiting for you at the end.}}
