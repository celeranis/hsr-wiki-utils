|effect   = After ally targets use an attack, apply "Fearful Tremble" equal to their "{{Extra Effect|Critical Boost|61000055}}" stack to an attacked target with the highest "Fearful Tremble" stacks. Every stack of "Fearful Tremble" reduces enemy targets' DMG dealt by {{Color|h|0.5%}}. When reaching {{Color|h|50}} stack(s), it deals Wind DMG equal to {{Color|h|3,500%}} of {{Extra Effect|base DMG|61000500}} and loses {{Color|h|20}} stack(s), then increases the enemy's CRIT DMG taken by {{Color|h|150%}} for {{Color|h|3}} turn(s). When the enemy target takes action, they obtain all "Fearful Tremble" on the field. When they are defeated, "Fearful Tremble" will be applied to the enemy target with the highest current stacks.

==Story==
{{Description|Hold your steps, young hunter. Yonder woods aren't our hunting grounds.<br />In this forest of bones, predators become prey.<br />The one-armed tiger is last of its line after mankind's massacre.<br />It cheated death and won Cerces' gift: wings veined with wisdom.<br />Kremnoan soldiers armored by gold, bellowing songs of war,<br />Ladon's rangers, their arrows dripping with venom, chill beasts to marrow.<br />The tiger baits soldiers into bottomless pools, their golden armors sinking swiftly in the glacial waters.<br />It cloaks itself in fog to dodge arrows, snapping the rangers' throats with a single bite.<br />Hush! Footfalls crunch. The air reeks of vengeance.<br />Run! With all your might. The king of the forest begins its hunt.}}
