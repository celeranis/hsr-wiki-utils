==Story==
{{Description|Have a drink, one-eyed fellow.<br />My last client bore a striking resemblance to you.<br />That one looted a neighboring village,<br />Emptied their money bags, and left severed heads in return.<br />And the red-haired noble, he humiliated a young man,<br />Comparing him to an animal lower than a rat.<br />There's surely a berth reserved for him on the longship of the Hand of Shadow.<br />As long as you're willing to pay the price,<br />I can slowly hang the unforgivable villain with a rope<br />Or use a short sword to fell a great hero.<br />My predecessors used to say this trade<br />Is like swimming in the river of the Hand of Shadow.<br />Terrifying, isn't it? But if it's not in these bleak times,<br />Who would want to do this accursed job?}}
