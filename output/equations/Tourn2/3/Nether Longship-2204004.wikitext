==Story==
{{Description|Wayworn traveler, will you brave our longship?<br />This salt-crusted relic ferries all wayward souls home.<br />Hewn from Aidonia's unrotting withered trees,<br />sails tough beyond comparison, and even once received a certain Titan's blessing.<br />We once trailed Castrum Kremnos' warpath,<br />plucking refugees who had lost their homeland.<br />We've surfed the roaring waves of the black tide,<br />netting thousands of innocent lives from drowning depths.<br />Brace yourself &mdash; the longship stirs.<br />May Thanatos summon the winds from the nether realm, for we come seeking their audience.}}
