==Story==
{{Description|What audacity! To pilfer the crown before gawping crowds,<br />then deface the king's bald head with uproarious graffiti.<br />This is Worthinnis' Master Thief&mdash;<br />swiping treasures and bestowing jests.<br />Ostentatious nobles don prized jewelry in the city, just to anticipate their arrival,<br />but only attract third-rate copycats.<br />Now, this historic citadel teems with pickpockets and pranksters,<br />yet none pursue the true identity of the Master Thief.<br />Merchants? Detour far and wide.<br />But to those who seek mirth &mdash; enter! I will open the gates for you.}}
