==Story==
{{Description|I would rather call Antiparus a playwright than a general,<br />For he turned the entire war into his own drama.<br />The people of Talanton, united with the soldiers of Georios,<br />Were cast as the villains.<br />The supporting Ladonians, arriving too late for the climax,<br />Reluctantly took on the role of chorus.<br />His legion, guided by the spear bestowed by the king,<br />Dedicated themselves to a meticulously crafted three-act play at his command.<br />The sounds of battle became a grand symphony, etching fear and anger onto the actors' faces.<br />Chariots collided, ranks clashed, like lions locked in a ferocious duel.<br />All the while, he savored the spectacle, taking his first step out of the military tent.}}
