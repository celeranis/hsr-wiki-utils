When taking action, advances the action of the first character in the current team by {{Color|h|100%}}. After that unit uses an attack, deals {{Color|h|10}} instances(s) of "{{Extra Effect|Aftertaste|61000054}}" DMG equal to {{Color|h|30%}} of the ally target's ATK, and up to {{Color|h|4}} instances of attacks can take effect.

==Story==
{{Description|You came too late. The blade of revenge has already carved out the heart of this king.<br />He strummed the melody of the sea, leaving the guards intoxicated in the wind.<br />The maidservants dreamed of boundless riches and indulged themselves in the game of scarf competition.<br />Even though I clutched my sword as I slept, I could not resist the frenzy in my heart.<br />He appeared before me just like this, with a crowd of revelers following behind.<br />The jesters clinked their goblets, as if celebrating my execution.<br />I offered no resistance and drank the honey brew he gifted me.<br />How I wished it had been a cup of poison, so I would not have to feel<br />The cold blade as it claimed my life.<br />Alas, the dirge played for me was utterly dull,<br />Far less enchanting than the melodies Lady Hysilens played before the expedition began.}}
