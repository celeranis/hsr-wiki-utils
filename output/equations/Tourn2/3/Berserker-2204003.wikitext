==Story==
{{Description|Broken spears mark the end of an unjust war.<br />The fallen warrior &mdash; his invincible body was drained of all blood.<br />Did he recall galloping along the frontiers with his brothers as they shared their ideals?<br />Back then, he was a true warrior, the pride and joy of all Kremnoans.<br />Did he remember how he was unwilling to die with glory, even as he carried grievous wounds,<br />choosing instead to offer his ravaged flesh to the Mad King in exchange for the power to fight endlessly?<br />Blinded by blood, he was oblivious to his brethren's pointless deaths.<br />Manipulated by cruelty, his hands showed no mercy even to children.<br />His brother mercifully ended this series of mistakes&mdash;<br />as the berserker fell, his soul finally returned home.}}
