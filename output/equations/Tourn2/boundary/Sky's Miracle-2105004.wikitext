==Story==
{{Description|This is a moment of destruction inscribed on a stone tablet. This is the miracle of Aquila, the Eye of Twilight.<br />In ancient times, a wise king once built a vessel to traverse the sky.<br />Arrogant politicians promised the people that they would challenge the authority of the Titans.<br />Ridiculous jesters eulogized the tyrant, declaring that the eternal sovereign would reign over the sky.<br />They vowed to surpass Okhema, ascend through layers of clouds,<br />Tread the city of the sky priests underfoot, and even break the sky to rise above the blazing sun.<br />People sang of the tyrant's greatness, as they hauled wood, wove hides,<br />And forged roaring machinery to draw and support the flying steel behemoth.<br />How magnificent! Bearing the pride and arrogance of an entire nation, it sailed in the direction of the realm of the gods.<br />How laughable! Flesh and steel were obliterated in the thunder, in the blink of an eye.}}
