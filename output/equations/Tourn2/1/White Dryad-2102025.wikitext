==Story==
{{Description|There is no need for words. Through the roots that connect our blood, your intent is already known to us.<br />Before Kephale created humanity, the White Dryad had already spread across the world.<br />Unlike your ignorant kind, our reason is deeply rooted in the earth.<br />Wisdom flows among us like the morning dew. Though we may wither, our seeds carry the promise of renewal.<br />We remember.<br />Cerces taught us to unfurl our leaves, to question our very being.<br />The travelling scholars all fell silent by our questions.<br />The first sage of the Grove got their revelation from our whispers.<br />So, are you seeking answers to the godslayer's journey? Then just lend your ear and listen.<br />Petals fall off, bury in the soil. Death nourishes new life. Failure is never the end.}}
