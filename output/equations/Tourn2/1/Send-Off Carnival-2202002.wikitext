==Story==
{{Description|Been to a Megnakken send-off?<br />You can't find that western little city on maps anymore.<br />I still remember, the people would dress the deceased in the finest clothing,<br />paint the most intricate makeup on corpses, and adorn caskets with fresh flowers and fragrances.<br />The circus performs in full swing on stage and close friends laugh heartily in the audience,<br />their grief measured in decibels.<br />This rave continues for three days and nights. As the performance reaches its climax, the corpse is cremated in flames.<br />Everyone would sing and dance around the pyre as a final farewell.<br />This tradition stems is rooted in their unique religion,<br />for they believe that Thanatos is but Zagreus in disguise.}}
