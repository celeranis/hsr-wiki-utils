==Story==
{{Description|I reclaimed half my life from that wretched black tide, but lost another half of it.<br />Let my warning save yours: Beware the Decrepit Bow.<br />It was once a proud kin of Strife, but its golden blood has been corrupted.<br />With cursed arrows in hand, it slaughters every living being in sight.<br />The withering bow shrieks as it fires arrows that never miss.<br />Comrades died there and then, and I've been wounded too.<br />As I escaped from the abomination, black blood trickled from my wound.<br />This wound will never heal, and shall devour my life.<br />I know not how much longer I have to live, as I await heaven's will.<br />Perhaps that shot of arrow had already carved the ending in destiny.}}
