==Story==
{{Description|Allow me to tell you an appalling tale of a hidden band.<br />They were elusive assassins. Even Zagreus found them a mystery.<br />When heroes stumbled into weariness, exposing their weaknesses,<br />The hunters emerged from the shadows of statues. The daggers revealed, the throats pierced.<br />Some said they were the kins of the Titans.<br />It was the retaliation from the gods to heroes who dared turn their blades upon the divine.<br />Some said they were the equalizers of the Scale of Justice,<br />Because the heroes traded their lives for the divine coreflame.<br />Others believed they were simply mortal beings.<br />They brought swords and poisons to reclaim peace after these golden-blooded usurpers seized power.}}
