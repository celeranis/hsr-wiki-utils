==Story==
{{Description|Do you remember that radiant troupe?<br />The sorrows and joys penned by the playwright Aeschylus.<br />They are the most warrior-like among theater troupes, always singing amidst the blazing fires of Strife.<br />They are the most priest-like among warriors, praising the peaks of Okhema and the dawn that lights the mortal realm.<br />"The hero Corinchi rises, guarding his honor with his short sword."<br />"Aecus' chariot crushes the tyrant, heralding victory."<br />The dispersed citizens gather, raising their weapons against calamity.<br />Even the thieves of Dolos pause for them,<br />Venturing into ruins with bravery, saving lives like heroes.<br />The legendary troupe of all time may have faded, but I still glimpse them in my dreams,<br />Where they don the masks of Kephale, playing as the god that upholds the world.}}
