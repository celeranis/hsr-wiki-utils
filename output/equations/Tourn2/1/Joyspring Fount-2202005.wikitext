==Story==
{{Description|Have a sip of the sweet spring water, for it is the Era Chrysea's legacy.<br />Beautiful ancient memories moisten your lips and vitalize your heart.<br />An era when joy grew thicker than dromas fur,<br />forcing humans to bury excess bliss in underground springs.<br />But who would have imagined that the black tide would come drowning humanity.<br />Only these waters stream on peacefully, year after year.<br />Now that the sealed history has been brought back to light accidentally, the golden liquid euphoria geysers,<br />drenching its surrounding in unparalleled ecstasy.<br />Sip lightly, however, and save your thirst.<br />There are darker days ahead, when you'll thirst for it again.}}
