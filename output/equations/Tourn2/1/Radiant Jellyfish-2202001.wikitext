==Story==
{{Description|Ever seen the ocean glitter? That's the Radiant Jellyfish throwing an eternal rave.<br />More than stars in the sky, horizon-to-horizon,<br />they are not afraid of humankind, even daring swimmers to join their luminous waltz.<br />Whispers claim they're Phagousa's kins.<br />As the ocean was far too dark at night,<br />they lit the way home for the drunken Phagousa.<br />Others insist they belong to Mnestia.<br />Golden butterflies fluttered into the ocean and transformed into jellyfish,<br />for their wings could not take flight in the sea.<br />Or perhaps they answer to no Titan,<br />simply dancing, propagating, and partying through millennia, from ancient past to the endless future.}}
