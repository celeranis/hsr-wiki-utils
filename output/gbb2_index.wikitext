After ally target or weapon deals DMG to an enemy target, if the target's current HP is below {{Color|h|20%}} of its Max HP, "Shadowed Assassin" immediately deals Physical DMG equal to its current HP. Additionally, each subsequent attack by ally targets or weapons inflicts Physical DMG equal to {{Color|h|500%}} of base DMG.
When a wave begins or whenever {{Color|h|12}} enemy targets are defeated, "Shadowed Assassin" instantly downs all non-elite targets and deals Physical DMG equal to {{Color|h|10%}} of their Max HP to elite and boss targets. This attack does not count toward the defeated enemy threshold.
