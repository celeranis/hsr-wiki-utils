''Before a campaign, Kremnoan citizens will organize a blood ritual, igniting Nikador's might with slaughter, singing hymns over the wails of the sacrificial tribute.''

The Undefeated, Overlord of Battlefields, King of Castrum Kremnos and the Ruins,<br />
Grand Artisan of Chariots, the Throne of Corpses, Father of Victory,<br />
The tyrant of glories, lightning that shatters earth and seas, Guardian of Amphoreus,<br />
Strife Titan, Lance of Fury, Nikador.

Commander to whom the world should bow, the eternally edged weapon, the law of Strife and that which severs strife.<br />
Praise Nikador, the greatest conqueror, the greatest protector.<br />
You are the tyrant of all defeated, solely bearing all wounds of the world on your back.

You were once the lightning spear of the firmament, the worldsplitting spine.<br />
Hewing of the River of Souls, survivors unto dead waters.<br />
Unceasing flames of war, pyre of high graves.<br />
The sky-piercing lance, the ruination of night and light.

The vanquished behold woe, glory to all honorable dead, the fallen feeds my might.<br />
Fury falls, and all bows to Strife &mdash;<br />
Sentinels who stand fast between the skies and earth, repel the enemy hordes and safeguard the peace of the myriad cities!<br />
Calamity eternal casting devastation on myriad cities, turning foes to ash!
