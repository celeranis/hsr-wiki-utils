Divination Result: "Within the confines of your mind"<br />
※ Note: Three subsequent identical queries were archived.

※ Note: Similar request from Strife Season was made by the same person, who left the city after receiving the prophecy.

Request: "Where is Aitee hiding?"<br />
Divination Result: "Beside you"<br />
※ Note: Due to lengthy processing times, playful children's queries (especially hide-and-seek related) should not be treated as formal requests.<br />
※ Note: According to Priest Monnta, the client was playing with the sought child when the slate was delivered, matching the divination result.

Request: "Where is tomorrow?"<br />

※ Note: The client was Priest Monnta, who found a farewell message and handcrafted gifts atop the desk.

Request: "Where is my child?"<br />
Divination Result: "At home"<br /><s>※ Note: Childish play, not recommended for processing.</s><br />※ Note: Priest Monnta disagreed, emphasizing the child's safety as a priority.

Request: "Where is the plainest piece from the tea set offered to Oronyx this time?"<br />
