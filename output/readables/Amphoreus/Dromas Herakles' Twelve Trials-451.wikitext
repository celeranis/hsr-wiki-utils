The dromas Herakles once traveled the lands, its heroics lauded even in distant kingdoms. This hereby records its grandest Twelve Trials, which I hope will allow you to <s>understand my great love for dromases</s> evangelizing the repute of the dromas, Herakles.

Battling the Verax Leo:<br />The fabled Verax Leo that does not slip on its words was thwarted by Herakles! Against the Verax Leo's acerbic inquiries, Herakles successfully silenced it with sheer strength, and after paying the compensation fee, adorned its saddle with the lion's mask.

Tiny chimera rescue:<br />Hydra was a wounded little chimera, losing eight of its nine tails from black tide corruption. 'Twas fortunate Herakles lent a hand! It lunged toward this little chimera and carried it on its back, successfully breaking through the black tide's encirclement.

Liberating Aquila's hunter:<br />Hunter Selene, self-proclaimed recipient of Aquila's blessing, had been pursuing a deer of prophecy for many years. The eagle-eyed Herakles sighted a pair of antlers among the black tide's vestiges, and successfully persuaded this hunter to abandon a mission that could never be accomplished.

Helping Oleinus' farmers:<br />Oleinus' farmers suffered from a wild boar invasion. They rampaged throughout the countryside, fleeting and erratically violent. The erudite Herakles procured ample fruits to lure them away, and defeated them in one fell swoop outside the village.

Cleaning the Ikaria dromases' home:<br />Ikaria's dromas stable lacked upkeep, and was infamous for its filthy state. The local dromases tolerated the threat of sickness to varying degrees, but never fear! The brave Herakles dislodged the riverbanks on both flanks of the dromases' abode &mdash; water from the two artificial inlets gushed the place clean, and the dromases could once again enjoy a life of cleanliness.

Driving away the Stymphalian avians:<br />There lived oddly-visaged birds with metal plumes on Stymphalia, frequently stealing olive oil and attacking oil mills and oild presses. The dromas Herakles invited the locals to stand on its back and pelt them with slingshots. After three days of non-stop stone showers, the birds were finally driven away.

Finding Handak's prized bull:<br />Handak's pedigree bulls were the pride of the local town, but a certain purebred bull had "eloped" with an ordinary spotted cow... 'Twas fortuitous that Herakles unleashed his unmatched might and forcefully dragged the obstinate animal back to the cattle pen in Handak City. Appreciative of Herakles' deed, the locals even let it revel in unlimited quantities of Handak's red earth!

Taming Odressian's frenzied dromases:<br />Due to the negligence of Odressian's dromas caretaker, red earth tainted by the black tide was fed to them, causing the four dromases there to go berserk. Fortunately, the mighty Herakles was with us &mdash; it single-handedly held down this quartet of enraged dromases till all traces of the black tide were fully digested in their systems, returning their mental states to their usual docility.

Winning the saddle blessed by Kephale:<br />Besides braving the dangers of the world, Herakles is also a champion dromas renowned by all in Okhema! When the city organized its inaugural Dromas Games, as the top seed that registered first, Herakles clinched top spots in all participating events, convincingly triumphing over the other five contenders, and winning a sacred saddle blessed by Kephale (Sponsor: Mr. Iason).

Bringing back Kadir's lost dromases:<br />A trio of Kadir City's dromases were stolen away by a fraudster in the dead of night. Using its acute olfactory senses, Herakles adroitly pinpointed the direction in which the culprit fled, recovering the lost dromases in a mountain ravine, and aided the guards in apprehending the fraudster.

Attaining the Grove of Epiphany's reward apple:<br />Okhema's second Dromas Games was sponsored and organized by an anonymous enthusiast of the sport, with its prize being a redsoil apple specially produced by the Grove of Epiphany. Inevitably, Herakles did not disappoint its supporters, emerging champion, and happily wolfed down this priceless synthetic apple.

Assisting in extracting black tide creation samples:<br />This was Herakles' most incredible trial till now! It was all thanks to its long neck that the people managed to retrieve a precious sample from the edge of the all-annihilating black tide, accomplishing a mission that even the Grove of Epiphany deemed nigh impossible. The sole lament was Herakles' nonchalance throughout the ordeal that everyone failed to grasp the peril of this quest...

The above is the Grand Trial of Twelve that Herakles the dromas performed! I trust that in the near future, this list will only be extended to thirteen, fourteen... till it reaches twenty-four feats!<br />
