<div align="center">To this day, we still weep for that resplendent Era Chrysea&mdash;<br />
The homeland we long for in our restless dreams.<br />
Now, Strife's pointed arms pierce its smooth joints,<br />
And Trickery's profanities tarnish its solemn visage.<br />
Its noble form, entombed beneath the River of Souls,<br />
Is barred from the world by the Titans of Calamity.

O great sky father, slumbering Throne of Worlds who upholds the Dawn,<br />
Have you sown the seeds of a merciful prophecy,<br />
To guide that gilded age back to our side?<br />
We can only offer it the purge of Calamity and show of piety.<br />
The warriors shall split Strife's pointed arms and burn away Trickery's profanities;<br />
The warriors shall, too, vanquish the Tyrant in the River of Souls,<br />
And cleanse the cold bones of death, and from therein lift a past reborn &mdash;

That future past is you, Era Chrysea,<br />
The homeland in our restless dreams.<br />
You adorned the boundless sky, earth, and sea with untainted gleam.<br />
You guided humanity's path with Gate and Scale,<br />
And gently stashed thousands of tales behind the Veil.<br />
With your kiss, lovers and true bonds from this earth you create,<br />
Under your witness, the all-knowing father blessed all with jovial fate.

Sky father above, we never sought that illusive afterlife &mdash;<br />
We weep only for that resplendent Era Chrysea,<br />
For it is our homeland to which we must return.</div>
