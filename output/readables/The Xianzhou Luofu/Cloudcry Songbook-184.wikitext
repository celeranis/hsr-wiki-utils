<div align="center">{{Size|36|"Dreams From a Past Life" (an aria from the "Fateful Rebirth")}}<br />
Sitting bored on my bed one dusk, <br />half the beaded curtain peeled back. <br />In no mood to awaken yet no mood to sleep, <br />clothes half-worn and eyes half-slack.<br />
A sudden gust of wind pushes forth the boat, <br />in dreams a war with the borisin we wage.<br />
Knife in hand, black and red horses leap on, <br />Alongside my husband's warship, in fight I engage.<br />
Two twittering orioles land on their branch, <br />with karma past doth this life's grief cast.<br />
Ten times reborn, with all its love and hate, <br />how hard can one take of a husband lost.<br />
Gazing up I now see daylight through that verdigris,<br />
those past loves and past lives seen only in reveries.

{{Size|36|"Eternal Regrets of A High Elder" (an aria from the "Dragontooth Tales")}}<br />
When the dragon turns red, then the green pines shall shed.<br />
Cast by the wind of a cold morning,<br />
Feeling the weight of your suffering.

When the dragon turns red, then the green pines shall shed.<br />
Spinning our glory through time and space,<br />
When will I next come to see your face?

When the dragon turns red, then the green pines shall shed.<br />
Wantonly drinking the silver moon,<br />
How many times must we be entombed?

When the dragon turns red, then the green pines shall shed.<br />
Pass like a dream out of sight and mind,<br />
six hundred years in this mortal bind.</div>
