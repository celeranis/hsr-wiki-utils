{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The Grove of Epiphany has issued its Intern Scholar Examination &mdash; an open call across all of Amphoreus. After twenty long years of academic toil, you know this is a chance you cannot let slip away.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The competition is staggering, with countless hopefuls vying for just three precious spots. You force yourself to calm the excitement buzzing in your veins &mdash; focus. The real question is: which of your research projects should you submit?
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Your scholarly pursuits span a dizzying array of fields, but in academia, raw merit isn't everything &mdash; Submitting something the panel likes is just as crucial.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Chimeras' post-natal care. &mdash; Obtain 3 Curio(s) of 1- to 2-star rarity, with a 30% chance to pass the resume filter
:{{DIcon|Star}} How bath salts of different compositions affect skin. &mdash; Obtain 1 random Curio(s) of 1- 2-star rarity, with a 50% chance to pass the resume filter
:{{DIcon|Star}} Study the possibility of artificially creating golden blood through alchemy. &mdash; Obtain 2 Blessing(s) of 1-star rarity, with a 100% chance to pass the resume filter
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Outrageous! Researching golden blood &mdash; is that even ethical? But... you have to admit, the subject is rather fascinating.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' A week later, the unthinkable happens &mdash; an acceptance letter from the Grove of Epiphany. "Congratulations! Your research has successfully passed the selection process. We are pleased to invite you for an interview at the Grove of Epiphany."
::{{DIcon|Star}} This is the fare. Please take it. &mdash; Obtain 50 Cosmic Fragments

:'''Simulated Universe:''' The Caprism reviewer might find this particular outcome intriguing... but the title? A bit questionable. Do chimeras even have postnatal physiology?
::'''Simulated Universe:''' A week later, the Grove of Epiphany delivers its verdict &mdash; a polite rejection. "Your research holds immense academic significance! However, it does not align with our current primary research direction. Your credentials have been added to our talent database, and we look forward to potential collaboration in the future."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "So be it. If the Grove of Epiphany can't recognize true genius, then I want no part of them." You say the words with defiance... but as you do, a lone tear betrays you, sliding down your cheek.
:;(Immediately ends the occurrence)

:'''Simulated Universe:''' Bathing is undoubtedly important, but presenting it as a groundbreaking scientific discovery? That might be a stretch. Then again, maybe there's a bath-loving reviewer on the panel?
