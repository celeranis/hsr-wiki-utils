{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Thanatos' River of Souls soaks the ancient battlefield. You stand at the edge of the steps, gazing down at swaying reeds beneath the tides, momentarily unsure if they are fresh new leaves or restless souls of plants long gone.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A wizened old man wades through water and approaches you. He tilts his head at you, finally speaking after a long moment.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Friend, spare a few gold coins? As long as I am given passage aboard Thanatos' ferry, I will give you anything in return!" He grabs your arm, and a sharp chill abruptly shoots down your spine.
