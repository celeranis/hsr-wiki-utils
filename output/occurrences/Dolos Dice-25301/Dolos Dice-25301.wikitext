:'''Simulated Universe:''' You stand at the heart of a celebration. The city square of Dolos bustles with excitement as the king prepares to unveil his invention with feigned mystery.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "This city once bore witness to two grand deceptions. The first time, even Zagreus, who managed to fool the other gods, was themself deceived. The second, when a shadowless thief brought forth puzzles to the former king. And now, I shall create the third miracle!" The king pulls back the black veil, revealing seven dice in seven colors spinning on its tray.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "I shall grant every citizen equal rights! As long as the fee is paid, everyone can participate in this game, which is beyond judgment. Seven dice, seven numbers. The more numbers you accurately guess, the better your rewards."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Chance and infinite possibilities &mdash; this is the king's invention. The citizens surge forth, eager in the notion that they may strike it rich overnight with the toss of a coin.

::{{DIcon|Star}} Quit while you're ahead. &mdash; Retrieve 800 Cosmic Fragment from the account
