:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Thus, this court hereby sentences you to undergo standardized failure therapy, until the balance between your success and failure index returns to the prescribed ratio." The judges raise their rulers and place them on your shoulders, as heavy electronic hums reverberate throughout the confined space.
