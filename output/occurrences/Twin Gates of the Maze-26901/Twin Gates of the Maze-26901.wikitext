:'''Simulated Universe:''' Before you stand two doors &mdash; one ancient and solemn, cast in bronze. The other radiant and opulent, sculpted from gold. You've been staring at them, unmoving, for an entire day &mdash; ever since you wandered too deep into this twisting labyrinth.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' As an adventurer who has roamed the farthest reaches of the world, you've seen the Janus priests use their mystical "passages" to bypass insurmountable barriers. But once a gate is opened, there's no going back.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Luckily, you aren't limited to a simple A or B choice. There's always a third option &mdash; walking out on your own.

:'''Simulated Universe:''' You grip the handle tightly, plant your feet, and shove with all your strength. But the moment the door moves, it swings open effortlessly, sending you tumbling inside.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Before your eyes, the two doors liquefy, and the bronze and gold engulfs you like molten lava. You fight to escape, but by the time you claw your way free, your backpack is completely deflated &mdash; all your treasures, gone, swallowed by the tide.
