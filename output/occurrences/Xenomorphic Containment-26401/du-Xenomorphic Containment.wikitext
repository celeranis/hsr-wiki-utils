{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The police aircar weaves through the tangled lanes of drone traffic, touching down smoothly atop a three-thousand-story skyscraper. Seven minutes have passed since the emergency call, and as a High-Risk Biohazard Disposal Specialist, you've finally made it to the crime scene.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "It's a shapeshifter. It's already tricked a few of our officers &mdash; stay alert." The on-site officer sends a data packet straight to your neural link. The next thing you know, a stabbing pain rips through your skull.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Ahahaha! Got another one!" The officer's body liquefies into a writhing mass of slime &mdash; then reshapes itself into a giant, mocking middle finger.
:{{DIcon|Star}} Still laughing? I'm sending you to your maker. &mdash; Enter a tough battle. If you win, you will gain 2 Blessing(s) of 3-star rarity and 100 Cosmic Fragments
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You flash a knowing smirk &mdash; what your slimy opponent doesn't realize is that, just moments ago, you hijacked the neural link and slipped a virus into its system. Outwitted and outclassed.
:{{DIcon|Star}} I'll spare your life. &mdash; Leave
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Not the best start to this mission... but a tactical retreat is better than a reckless demise. You can deal with it another day.
