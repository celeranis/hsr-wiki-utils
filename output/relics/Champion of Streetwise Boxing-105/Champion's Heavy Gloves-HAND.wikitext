'''Champion's Heavy Gloves''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Champion of Streetwise Boxing]].

==Description==
When Lindsay first entered the boxing ring, her fighting style was utterly unbalanced, for she only knew how to attack but never how to defend. 

All her years of street fighting were inadequate to prepare her for the fight in the ring. The match arranged by Icaterina put Lindsay into her place.

A series of successive defeats in local fights shattered Lindsay's arrogance and deeply humbled her, forcing her to reflect on the balanced offensive and defensive rhythm that Icaterina was teaching her. As if kissed by the goddess of combat, this once-stubborn street fighter gradually came to understand the significance and joy of balancing offense with defense. The next thing she knew, her hand wraps were torn, and her gloves soaked with sweat and blood.

"Never let yourself fall into your opponent's traps. Remember your own rhythm."

Now Lindsay finally came to appreciate Ica's words and her loving gaze. The usually stern Ica had long loved Lindsay like she would her own child.
