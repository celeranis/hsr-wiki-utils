{{Description|A boxer's professional-level chest guard. The outer and inner padding is designed to provide protection while not hindering movement.}}
'''Champion's Chest Guard''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Champion of Streetwise Boxing]].

==Description==
The scene in the training gym on the night before the championship fight was like the old days. The sounds of quick and heavy punches on the sandbag echoed throughout the gym.

Sweat soaked through her chest guard and the scorching steam detached Lindsay from reality, making her crave to escape it all.

Lindsay tried her best to control her emotions as her face glimmered with sweat and tears. Late into the night, she finally took off her chest guard and wrote the name "Ekat" on the inside. She wants to swear she would achieve victory for this name. This was a key match in Lindsay's path to becoming the boxing champion, and her first fight without her coach by her side. Before Lindsay stepped into the ring, she held out her chest proudly to the camera.

"Lindsay.. I couldn't believe you share the same name with my daughter. I always thought I was done with the world for good when she passed, until I finally met you. Thank you, Lindsay."

"Protect me, Ekat." The most important name was right by her heart.
