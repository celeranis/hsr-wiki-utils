'''Champion's Fleetfoot Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Champion of Streetwise Boxing]].

==Description==
With a rather petite figure, Lindsay became famous for her fast punches and nimble footwork that allowed her to dance in the ring like a fluttering butterfly amidst flowers.

Regardless of how fast her opponents could throw a punch, all their strikes could never hit Lindsay. Such was the power of what was known as Lindsay's Dance.

To train Lindsay's unique footwork, Icaterina took the street urchin to a high-society ball, where they danced hand in hand, spin after spin... Though clumsy at first, Lindsay eventually got the hang of the refined dance steps. She realized that there was more to this old boxing coach than met the eye. Among the flowing sea of dancers, a soft spot in Lindsay's heart was suddenly struck by a magical feeling.

"One more dance?"

Lindsay's upbringing on the street did not at all prepare her for such experiences. Seeing the twinkle in Icaterina's eyes, how could Lindsay refuse?
