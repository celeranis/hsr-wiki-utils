'''Captain's Navigator Hat''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wavestrider Captain]].

==Description==
Among the coastal reefs, the wreckage of a trireme lay stranded like a beached whale &mdash; It was once a warship campaigning against the sea sirens. The waves returned the ship to shore, but left its demised crew behind in the depths of the sea.

"O warrior of Phagousa, whoever you are, I beg you to stand and defend Skiana!" The king's desperate plea met only silence, for to stand against the sea sirens only meant becoming another lifeless body adrift on the waves.

"Give me an unbreakable ship and a crew of fifty, and I will slay the wicked sea siren!" A young captain, wearing a wide-brimmed sun hat, stepped forward from the crowded masses. The pearlescent sheen of his hat cast a shimmering rainbow over the pale, fearful faces around him. His arrival was like the dawn over the sea, and in an instant, the horizon had already begun to lighten.

"I will build you the finest ship in the world!" The craftsmen, drawn in by the young captain's radiance, pledged their skills. The great ship's timber was impervious to decay, ensuring it would never rot upon the sea. At its bow, a plank hewn from Cerces's giant tree was affixed, imbued with the power of prophecy.

"Go forth, disciple of the Sages, chosen hero of the gods, tame the madness of Phagousa." Three days later, the fully crewed warship set sail from Skiana.
