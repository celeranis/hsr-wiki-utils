'''Captain's Wind Mantle''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wavestrider Captain]].

==Description==
A bronze ballista bolt, as tall as a man, tore through the sea mist wrapped in flames, only to shatter into dust the moment it neared the siren's scaled armor. The pale blue tentacles coiled tightly around sailors' waists, and even when severed, they writhed across the deck, gnawing at the terrified crew.

"The siren's limbs thrashed in the air, crying out my name. That was the most terrifying sight of my seafaring career." The captain's voice trembled between his lips and teeth. He was not lying.

The colossal sea siren surfaced, its gnarled tentacles coiling tightly around the ship. Its back loomed like a drifting island. The first mate drove a searing iron spear into its gaping maw, lined with a thousand razor-sharp teeth. A spray of foul black blood splattered across the deck, darkening the planks. The crew narrowly escaped a fatal attack, but as the captain turned back, he saw the stern tower crushed beneath a massive tentacle, shattered as easily as Nikador's Lance of Fury cracking open a walnut shell. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Charge forward or retreat? All eyes turned to the captain&mdash;

"Hard to port! Rowers, full speed! Unfurl all sails, prepare the ram for impact!"

The captain's cloak billowed in the roaring wind, and the crew steeled themselves, ready to face death. Steel clashed against scales, the keel shattered, and the sea siren let out a wailing cry. Its once-mighty form, now drained of its former power, slowly sank into the depths of the sea.
