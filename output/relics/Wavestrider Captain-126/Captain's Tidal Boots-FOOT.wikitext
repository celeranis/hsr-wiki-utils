{{Description|Shattered waves bloomed beneath the captain's boots. Even if he never returned, the tides would carry back his blessing.}}
'''Captain's Tidal Boots''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wavestrider Captain]].

==Description==
On an unknown sandy shore, the young captain lay on his back, gazing at the sky. The setting sun cast a golden glow over the shattered coastline... Within this radiant haze, the distant land of Skiana seemed almost within reach, but he knew this was the final moment of his life.

"...We have tamed the madness of Phagousa." The sea siren had long retreated into the deeper waters, unlikely to threaten the coast again for a hundred years.

The plank, hewn from Cerces's giant tree, asked the captain for his final words. It would ride the waves back to the distant land of Skiana, carrying the tale of the hero's journey and inspiring more young souls to set sail beyond the shore. The captain gazed at his severed lower half... those were the boots his wise mentor had given him, the ones that had carried him across countless city-states. But now, his long voyage would end here.

"Tell them... I still have a Sea of Souls left to conquer. My homeland, do not grieve for me."

Year after year, the sea breeze brushed against the walls of Skiana. The tale of the sea siren became a whispered lullaby from mothers to their children... And those sailors who had narrowly escaped the cursed sea still waited for their captain to ride the waves home.
