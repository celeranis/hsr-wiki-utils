{{Description|A nautical compass that captures the guidance of starlight. Even when adrift in the boundless darkness of the sea, the stars will always point the way forward.}}
'''Captain's Lightcatcher Astrolabe''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Wavestrider Captain]].

==Description==
Dark clouds, heavy like lead and iron, pressed down upon the mast. Amid the raging storm, the ship was like a drifting water lily, and even the deck crafted from the sacred tree trembled violently against the towering waves.

"Even the once-tranquil seas, where the waves were calm and the winds gentle all year round, have now been tainted by the siren's wild and violent nature." The young captain stood atop the forecastle tower, his brows tightly furrowed as he gazed at the dense, dark storm clouds ahead... yet the astrolabe on his wrist remained unresponsive.

A bolt of lightning struck down, snapping the main sail's rigging with a resounding crack. The crew fell into chaos, shouting and scrambling. The young captain bellowed, restoring order. He commanded the rowers to pull in unison, their strength guided by precise orders. The helmsman responded swiftly, steering the ship away from the towering waves that loomed like mountains. They fought against Phagousa's fury, enduring until Aquila's guiding starlight would pierce the storm. Suddenly, the captain raised his arm high, his voice cutting through the storm. The nautical compass on his wrist shimmered with scattered fragments of starlight&mdash;

"Follow that light, everyone! We're about to break out of the storm!"

The sailors rallied their spirits, singing a sea shanty in unison. The ship, like a sharpened blade, cleaved through the waves, charging toward the dawn.

"Soon, we will set her free from shackles. Look ahead, prepare! Set sail!"
