{{Description|A flute whistle, shaped from clay. It symbolizes the promise between the little fairies and the two children. Whenever the boy and girl blew into it &mdash; "Mem?" &mdash; the tree hole leading to the maze would open, and the fairies would welcome them back with joy.}}
'''Membrance Maze's Wishing Whistle''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Arcadia of Woven Dreams]].

==Description==
"Don't forget our promise! Whenever you blow your Wishing Whistle, no matter how far away you are, we'll hear you."

That was the first time the small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae had stumbled into the Membrance Maze and met the fairies. They'd been playing hide-and-seek in the yard with their friends when they accidentally fell into a tree hole hidden in the tall weeds. It was deep &mdash; so, so deep &mdash; like a bottomless slide. But instead of crashing in a daze at the bottom, they tumbled right into a crowd of fairies...<br />"One two three four five six seven! So many puppies &mdash; wait, no, rabbits?"<br />"No no no! We're do re mi fa sol la ti! I'm Dolimem, that's Solimem, and that one's Relimem!"

Their friendship with the fairies was like a thousand shooting stars &mdash; sudden, sparkling, and unforgettable. They spent a day full of laughter together. But soon, it was time to go. If they didn't head back, Mom and Dad would start to worry.<br />"Will we get to see each other again?" the boy asked, a little sad.<br />Farewell... See you again... The fairies didn't quite understand those words. In the Membrance Maze, no one ever left, so there was no need to say goodbye. But judging from the look on the children's faces, they realized it must be something upsetting. The purple Relimem thought for a moment. "Wait, Snowy, Reney! I have something for you!"

The boy and girl held Relimem's gift in their palms. It was a tiny whistle shaped like a fairy's ear, handmade by Relimem itself. It had seven holes, and when blown, each note rang clear and sweet &mdash; Do, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Ti. Relimem said earnestly, "If you ever want to come back and play in the Membrance Maze again, just blow this whistle. No matter if we're sleeping, singing, or building leaf houses... we'll hear you. And we'll open the tree hole to the maze for you."

"A mystery flute that wakes up fairies!" the girl giggled. "Pinky promise &mdash; we'll come back again."<br />From then on, Relimem's happiest moments were when the whistle sounded. It would always shout with joy &mdash; "I hear it! I hear it with both ears!"

As time passed, Snowy and Reney, who had left Aedes Elysiae behind, remembered everything about their childhood: The rusted tin toys, the armless toy soldiers in the barn, the crocheted felt flowers, the rains that never came, the dried-up blood, the wheat fields burned down to brittle husks...<br />But they forgot the little whistle buried in the dirt... And a promise they could no longer keep.
