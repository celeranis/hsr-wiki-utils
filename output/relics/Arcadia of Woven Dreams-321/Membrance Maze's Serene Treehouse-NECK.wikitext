{{Description|Encapsulated in the Planar Sphere is the Membrance Maze of Aedes Elysiae. Brush aside the golden wheat, and down, down, down you tumble into a deep tree hollow. Huh? There are so many little fairies! "One two three four five six seven?" Wrong! It's "Do re mi fa sol la si!"}}
'''Membrance Maze's Serene Treehouse''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Arcadia of Woven Dreams]].

==Description==
"Hehe, children, the Membrance Maze's harvest season is upon us once again. So... what must we prepare?" The chief stroked his white beard with a jolly smile.<br />"The Brew Festival!" The fairies cheered in unison.

At the beginning, the Membrance Maze was but a barren land. A small boy and girl from Aedes Elysiae brought seeds from the outside world and taught the fairies to plant them. When the seeds bloomed into flowers, the fairies followed their lead, collecting nectar along the grape trellises, where golden fuzzy-legged bees buzzed about. Then came the fruits, ripe and plump &mdash; the season of harvest. The fairies would gather to sing celebratory songs and hold feasts lasting deep into the night. And after the night? They'd bottle up that year's nectar, bury it deep in the earth, and wait for it to ferment into a potion that'd heal both winter's cold and the aches of growing up.

That's how every Brew Festival goes.<br />But this year, the chief asked as he tugged his white beard, "Has anyone seen Relimem?"

The fairies searched high and low &mdash; until they found Relimem fast asleep at the treehouse door. A bubble puffed from the corner of its mouth, clearly immersed in an exceptionally wonderful dream. The curious Milimem crept closer and heard it murmuring in its sleep &mdash; "Snowy, Reney... you promised to return. Together, we'll drink the Quillorb Fruit Brew we buried last year!"

In the dream, Relimem had turned into a giant &mdash; so humongous, it completely blocked the tree hole to Membrance Maze. The two tiny children couldn't find a way in. Snowy and Reney tried tickling Relimem's ears with bulrush, bouncing on its belly, calling its name over and over. But Relimem slept on, far too deeply to hear them.<br />"Oh no... what if Snowy and Reney never came back because I blocked the way?"<br />Relimem's heart began to pound in its dream.

"A... Achoo!"<br />With a loud sneeze, Relimem woke up. Phew! Good thing it hadn't turned into a giant treehole-blocking Relimem after all. But... there were fairies gathered all around.<br />"Snowy and Reney... did they come?"<br />The fairies shook their heads. No one could remember how many Brew Festivals it had been since the last time they showed up.<br />Relimem drooped again. Maybe it should've stayed in that dream just a little longer.<br />Little Relimem didn't quite know how to describe this emotion. But if it had to try &mdash; it felt just like the last day of summer, when you let those flickering fireflies in the glass jar flutter away.
