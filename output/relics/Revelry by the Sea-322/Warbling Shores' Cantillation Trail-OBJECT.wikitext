{{Description|The people of Styxia firmly believe that the sea sirens, just as the legends say, guard their paradise with flesh and blood. And that one day, drawn by the lighthouse's endless cantillation, they will arrive at last, rewarded with an eternal feast.}}
'''Warbling Shores' Cantillation Trail''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Revelry by the Sea]].

==Description==
Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play melodies yet unplayed on the water lyre.

The lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. Then, white longboats carry tumblers and jesters and glide through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces covered in masks decorated with gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.

Then, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds with Styxia as the stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the walls that were never defended. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown every beggar in the city. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the lyre's music, drunk beyond reason.

The crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes that are soothing and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she plays the attendant of Phagousa &mdash; the Queen of the sea sirens.

In this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard an anguish beyond mortal imagination in the ocean's deepest. Using their flesh and blood, they guide the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, exchanging for Styxia's eternal joy. When the appointed time comes, the sirens will finally follow the lighthouse's light and the lyre's song, and walk along the causeway to enter Styxia. The people of the city will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.

The Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam deep beneath the waves. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known &mdash; then their flesh dissolves. A pity that there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always &mdash; The tears ascend instead of the sea sirens, surfacing onto the glimmering sea surface, like floating foam that dissolves into the waves.

The lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. By the time the first note of the song rings out, the withered wings of death have already covered this city of everlasting joy.
