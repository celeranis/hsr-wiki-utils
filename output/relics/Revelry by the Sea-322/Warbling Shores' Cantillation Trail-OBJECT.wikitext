{{Description|The people of Styxia firmly believe that the sea sirens, just as the legends say, guard their paradise with flesh and blood. And that one day, drawn by the lighthouse's endless cantillation, they will arrive at last, rewarded with an eternal feast.}}
'''Warbling Shores' Cantillation Trail''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Revelry by the Sea]].

==Description==
Like those who came before him, the lonely sailor lingers between sea and city, poised on the threshold between the mortal world and revelry. He wipes the oil seeping from the wound of a stranded whale. At nightfall, he lights the beacon. Then, seated before the light, he begins to play the water lyre &mdash; melodies yet unplayed echo through the strings.

The lighthouse hums with each note, and all of Styxia is swept into song. The melodies, sometimes gentle, sometimes fevered, stir boundless fantasies of delight in the Styxia Queen's heart. When the sailor begins to play in reverse from the final semibreve rest, the tune becomes whimsical and sprightly. White longboats carry tumblers and jesters, gliding through the canals. Men and women in splendid attire line the shores, their faces masked in gold leaf and feathers. The Queen slips among them, drifting through the scent of lilac and almonds.

Then, the sailor sharpens the rhythm, the notes ringing wild and triumphant. A city-wide play unfolds upon Styxia's very stage. Townsfolk dressed as pirates wave black flags, storming the undefended walls. They plunder wine and gold, hang nobles upon flower-strewn gallows, and crown the beggars. At the finale, the tower is set ablaze, and the crowd dances madly to the rising music, drunk beyond reason.

The crashing tide dampens the sheet music, blurring notes meant to soothe and slow. In the mist before the lighthouse, the Queen steps into a new script. Dressed in a sea-blue fishtail dress, she becomes the attendant of Phagousa &mdash; the Queen of the sea sirens.

In this tale, the sirens are tasked to guard in the ocean's deepest, where anguish beyond mortals festers. They bear the burden in flesh and blood, drawing the pitch-dark calamity into the Chalice of Plenty, so that Styxia may revel in eternal joy. And when the appointed time comes, the sirens will follow the lighthouse's light and song, walk along the causeway, and enter Styxia. The people will take their hands, and together, they shall join the never-ending celebration.

The Queen of Styxia wades into the water, embracing an imagined demise. On a night when the tides break free from the moon's restraints, deep beneath the waves, the hollow tears of the sea sirens rise like foam. They hope. They wait. They gaze upon moonlight they've never known &mdash; until their flesh dissolves. But there is no moonlight tonight. Only the lighthouse flickers, as always. And so their tears ascend alone, surfacing in a shimmer before dissolving into the waves.

At last, the lonely sailor is granted his wish. The revelers, eyes glistening with blissful tears, welcome him into Styxia. And with the first note of the eternal chorus, the withered wings of death unfurl above this city of everlasting joy.
