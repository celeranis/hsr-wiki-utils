{{Description|Encapsulated in the Planar Sphere is Styxia, the city drowned in eternal revelry. A lighthouse remains endlessly lit upon the shore, playing ceaseless melodies. Ships, lured by merry tunes, sail through the mists only to run aground and sink, their shattered wreckage devoured by the tide.}}
'''Warbling Shores' Blazing Beacon''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Revelry by the Sea]].

==Description==
The sea wave is an endless rondo. Weary of pleasure-seeking harbors, the sailors unfurled their charts and chose their journey's end. Their compass stilled, its trembling needle pointing toward Styxia, the city of everlasting joy along the coast &mdash; their fated tomb of bliss. They took no heed. Unaware of death, they raised their sails in drunken glee and stepped eagerly into Phagousa's ballroom.

Following the rhythm of tides and the moon, the sailors sang as they harpooned the spines of whales, as they rammed their prows into ancient glaciers, as they sailed, ever laughing... until they were lost in the mist, until the lighthouse loomed close &mdash; until at last, they crashed upon the reef.

The wrecked ships sank beneath the waves. From the sea wave, the undying rose again. The sailor climbed ashore, seaweed and salt crusting his body. The revelers of the lighthouse had waited long. They bowed, inviting him to join the eternal celebration. Following the music, they crossed the long causeway and stepped onto the white lighthouse between the reefs. Fueled by whale oil, the flame of Styxia's beacon danced cold and blue, encased in lenses carved from crystals. The tower itself stood as a massive water lyre. With every step upward, guests could see seawater siphoning through glass pipes embedded in the masonry, pulsing with the rhythm of the sea. On the terrace, the revelers danced hand in hand, circling the light as music filled the air. Their shadows stretched long across the distant sea. And there &mdash; at the edge of the horizon &mdash; the sailor saw it: the city of eternal joy he had dreamed of.

That was an age before decay, when pain, sorrow, and death were still unborn. Styxia basked in Phagousa's favor, embraced by a crescent bay like a cradle, lulled by lullabies tender as sleep.

The sailor's lips trembled with anxiety. Before him, the revelers opened their arms &mdash; welcoming him as kin, to share in boundless ecstasy. Yet, behind him stretched the endless gray sea. Wreckage littered the reefs, drowned souls drifting in the waves, sea anemones and coral creeping across their skin. He remembered the moment he fell &mdash; how the undercurrents dragged him into the dark and hopeless deep. The sea siren's cold hand had caressed his cheek. Through her blurred, gentle singing, he awoke and was pushed back toward the shimmering surface.

Yet that one moment of hesitation &mdash; just one glance back &mdash; was enough. The gates to bliss shut. Smiling, the revelers turned the sailor away from entering Styxia &mdash; for a soul still shaking off the remnants of trance could never withstand true rapture.
