{{Description|This winged helm once bore witness to the Daythunder Knight toppling the sky god, and it also witnessed the sky closing its eyes.}}
'''Warrior Goddess's Winged Helm''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Warrior Goddess of Sun and Thunder]].

==Description==
Scorching golden magma surged endlessly beneath the warrior goddess's feet. She hid her expression beneath her iron helm, like winter mist veiling the starlight.

The last Skyfolk had already sunk, and she, too, would journey alone toward a distant fate in the opposite direction.

"Seliose, who have you remembered?" The winged beast, her constant companion, sensed the faint stir of her thoughts. The warrior goddess remained silent for a moment. The old days when people prayed to the sky were long gone, never to return. "Who have I remembered? I can no longer recall anyone in particular. I once loved humanity so fiercely, and I loathed the weakness buried within their nature just as deeply. But now... I remember no one at all."

The winged beasts lowered their heads in silence. They had seen the warrior goddess once follow unwavering convictions, and just as easily fall into the illusions of self-deception.

What expression did she now wear beneath that iron helm concealing her face? And what kind of vision did she now behold?
