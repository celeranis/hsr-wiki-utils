{{Description|These spurs were a gift from the Daythunder Knight's two winged beast companions. This was the necessary pain to walk a path in pursuit of truth.}}
'''Warrior Goddess's Honor Spurs''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Warrior Goddess of Sun and Thunder]].

==Description==
The hero, Seliose, was accompanied by two winged beast companions &mdash; Solabis and Lunabis, who were both her steed and comrade in battle.

"We follow you, Seliose. Let us witness the prologue of your journey to slay gods and take their flames." They placed their trust in the fierce and resolute warrior goddess.

The two winged beasts entrusted a master craftsman to forge a pair of spurs as part of the "Daythunder Knight's" knighting ceremony. "Thank you for your kindness, but I have no need for them," she said, knowing that spurs were meant to aid a knight in precisely controlling their steed. "Your will and mine are one. We do not need such stimulus to move in perfect harmony."

"Take them, Seliose. You walk the path in pursuit of truth, so you should understand that 'pain' keeps us awake." Lunabis's gaze burned with unwavering determination, while Solabis guided her hand to accept the spurs.

The Daythunder Knight accepted the ceremonial gift, a symbol of their friendship. If pain could help one correct their course in time, then it was pain worth bearing.
