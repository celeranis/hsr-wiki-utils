{{Description|These gauntlets have accompanied the knight to victory in every battle. They grant the strength to grip the deadliest weapons, and endure the most agonizing betrayals.}}
'''Warrior Goddess's Cavalry Gauntlets''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Warrior Goddess of Sun and Thunder]].

==Description==
The silverscale rock hisses in the forge. The old Mountain Dweller poured their wishes into these casted gauntlets before giving them to the warrior goddess beside them as a gift.

"Soft, wounded. Knights are hardy. Softer than marble. May your bones be."

She took the delicately crafted gauntlets and gently wiped down the silverscale frost armor... Her thoughts drifted to the lance, forged from cleaving thunder, and the shield, born from blooming flames. She would charge toward the battlefield in the sky, to save everyone, because strength was merely a prerequisite for salvation. The Mountain Dweller carefully engraved the maxims of truth onto each knuckle, reminding the warrior goddess to always remember the softness within the gauntlets.

"Use the palm to soothe the river of stars. Use the sword to cleave the frost."

Yet, the almost obsessive sense of duty and justice she had ended up burning the craftsman's blessing into a never-healing scar.
