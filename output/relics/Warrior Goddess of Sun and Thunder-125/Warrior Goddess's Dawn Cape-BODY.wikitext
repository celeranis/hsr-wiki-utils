'''Warrior Goddess's Dawn Cape''' is a [[Relic]] in the set [[Warrior Goddess of Sun and Thunder]].

==Description==
The girl, not yet a knight, received exceptional combat training in the secluded mountain cave of her mentor.

"Well done. Soon, there will be nothing more I can teach you. What do you intend to do with this power?"

The girl's thoughts were no longer on her training after hearing the divine oracle. Her gentle mentor noticed her troubled mind and quietly applied resin to the blade of her trusted short sword. "Teacher, I want to live in truth. Have you heard... about the Holy Maiden of Janusapolis and the prophecy she delivered?" The girl feared her mentor would try to dissuade her, yet her resolve had already been set.

"But what is truth?" The gentle mentor asked in return. "...You will need a lifetime to discern it, and that will not be easy."

At midnight, she quietly rose, hoping to leave in haste before dawn arrived, only to find that her travel pack already contained a neatly folded cloak.
