:'''Ruan Mei:''' "You're here." There isn't a single hint of emotion in Ruan Mei's voice. She seems unsurprised by your arrival. "This is our 'secret' space. Just as it used to be, please don't tell Herta... it will self-destruct after a certain amount of time."
:'''Ruan Mei:''' "The cultivated data has seen some unusual expansion. It's quite mysterious. It's not difficult to handle, but... I don't know how much longer this 'secret' can remain hidden," she pouts, tilts her head, and smiles gently. "Thank you for coming. You've brought me some valuable data again. Now, let me give you some rewards &mdash; for our 'future'."
:'''Ruan Mei:''' "However, you remember my help 'doesn't come for free', right?"
