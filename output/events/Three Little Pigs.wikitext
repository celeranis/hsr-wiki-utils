{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Three timid sequence creatures that resemble a pig bump into you as you wander across the wilderness where the Hithradahn people dwell. They react differently to your presence: one is trembling, one is ready to flee, and one is in a combat position.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You remember the description written in the Interastral Peace Guide. The creatures are called Sequence Trotters, and they are trans-latitudinal organisms. They spend most time of their lives eating and escaping.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Running into a Sequence Trotter is an auspicious sign. You start to think of a way to deal with them. The rules of the game must be fixed according to the personality of each Trotter.

;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Preservation|Preservation]] in a Simulated Universe Expansion)
:{{Icon/Dark|Path Preservation Small.png|20}} You pass on a good sense of safeguarding against Trotters. &mdash; Reduces Trotter's SPD and DMG received. When choosing your Blessings after winning a battle, Enhance all Blessings that appear.

:{{DIcon|Star}} Play a bit with Sequence Trotters. &mdash; You're entering a room with three Trotters. Be mindful that they don't run away.
