:'''Simulated Universe:''' A "hacker" suddenly invades the screen as you are engrossed in the video game you are playing. The congregating data form it takes gradually solidifies &mdash; it appears to be a blue-haired being. It sways its blue hair and flashes you a smile.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "I'm trying to replicate Madam Herta's Curios. Don't ask me who I am. This is just my virtual avatar. I'll offer you something nice... but they're different to how normal Curios work. You have to pay the price first before you get the rewards," it says.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Do you want to take the deal?
