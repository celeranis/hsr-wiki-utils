{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' Before the powerful hammering, whimpers and indecipherable words sound off, the Self-Annihilator with crooked ankles gazes upon you... He claims to have been alone in dialogue with the past for a long time, and that no traveler had ever stepped foot here.
:'''Ember Universe:''' He would be interrupted by sudden flashes of his memory, and temporarily stop talking, before raising his head to recollect his train of thought. He hands you a cloth written full of words... This is a memoir written by a Navigator who loves poems.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Remembrance|Remembrance]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Remembrance|Put the fragments back together.|You keep feeling a sense of familiarity with this... Have you done something like this before?}}
::'''Ember Universe:''' A worm who lets out a bellowing laugh once rubbed shoulders with countless people. A soldier who's trying to kill himself thus gains "joy," which in turn becomes the desire to live. But the joy that a mere single worm can spread is limited; it is always fluctuating, diluting and coalescing in three days.
::'''Ember Universe:''' Just then, the Self-Annihilator stretches out his hand, gulping as if to keep some temptation at bay, and on the fourth day, he finally remembers the {{Color|Keyword|annihilation of self}}.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Elation|Elation]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Elation|Calm down the Self-Annihilator first.|You keep feeling a sense of familiarity with this... Have you done something like this before?}}
::'''Ember Universe:''' You caress touch his arched back with your hand, and a creeping chill rises within you &mdash; this should be the land of [[Tayzzyronth]]'s fated beginning and end, but there is only desolation here.
::'''Ember Universe:''' Just then, the Self-Annihilator stretches out his hand, gulping as if to keep some temptation at bay, and on the fourth day, he finally remembers the {{Color|Keyword|annihilation of self}}.
