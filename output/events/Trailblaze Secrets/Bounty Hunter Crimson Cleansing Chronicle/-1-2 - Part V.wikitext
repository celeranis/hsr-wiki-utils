{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' You find yourself amidst a pile of gibbering screws and gears on a vibrant spring afternoon. This is the first time these Intellitrons have ever come into contact with organic life, as the result of an accidental landing by a hooded traveler on an interstellar voyage.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Destruction|Destruction]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Destruction|Make the little screws quiet down!|Don't touch his hat! This isn't the afternoon to get acquainted with ice cubes.}}
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Elation|Elation]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Elation|Touch his hat!|You can do whatever you put your mind to!}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' Since then, the inorganic beings have taken a keen interest in this outlandish traveler, who always gives lectures to the screws and gears on vibrant spring afternoons while weeping &mdash; an emotion that is entirely new to the inorganic beings. The first lesson in biological knowledge that he imparted from across the stars was something like this: "Research has shown that the blood of different species of insects is not of the same color."
