;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Elation|Elation]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Elation|Act according to the record.|You're eager to try it!}}
::'''Origin Universe:''' Exactly! Reversing the magnetic poles of the knife and fork will lure those behemoths! They will follow the magnetism, exposing their weak spots as they open their huge maws.

::'''Origin Universe:''' Just wait a bit longer for the match to flash three times, and a dramatic scene will unfold...
