:'''Screwllum:''' "That great being was devoted to becoming a master pastry chef." [[Screwllum]] turns the gears on his glasses, studying the details of the latest subject's fate. "He declined the help from the superheroes, stating that he would only return to us once he had perfected the art of baking. And he believed that the key to tasty Xiaolongbao was in the thin pastry."
:'''Screwllum:''' "Conclusion: Organic beings can be complex in their minds, which is highly commendable," states Screwllum, in his refined demeanor. "He pounded the crust and refused to leave his bakery shop, even when it collapsed from an earthquake."

::'''Ember Universe:''' He won't be coming! Tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow... However long you wait for Norbati, he will not come.
::'''Herta:''' "Why didn't you just ask your superheroes bring him and his Xiaolongbao back together?" [[Herta]] asks. "But don't worry, for Norbati III will carry the will of his predecessors on his shoulders and live on!"
::'''Ruan Mei:''' "That won't be necessary," replies [[Ruan Mei]]. "The experiment ends here. I'll choose another life form next time."
::'''Herta:''' "Is this the end?" Herta's voice carries a hint of reluctance. "Well, I don't think either Screwllum or I know you well... but it doesn't matter. The experiment is over! As for Norbati III... Screwllum will be taking care of him. Well, those screws will take good care of him."
