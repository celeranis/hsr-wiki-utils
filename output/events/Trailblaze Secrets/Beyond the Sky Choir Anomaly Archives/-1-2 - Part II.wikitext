{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Swarm Universe:''' The Beyond the Sky Choir's singing was being muffled out by the high walls, thus becoming a source of dispute with the Architects, until a young singer tragically fell into the sea after climbing over the wall with his elder brother using the *inseparable* deception...
:'''Swarm Universe:''' ...His sacrifice marked the end of this farcical dispute.
:'''Swarm Universe:''' And a crowd was kneeling by the shore, expressing their thanks for the drowned, even if they still don't know *which one* of the twins it was.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Nihility|Nihility]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Nihility|Kneel in a straight angle next to the shore.|Are you willing to be devout...}}
::'''Swarm Universe:''' The waters of sea before you is akin to a silken sheet of glass blades unendingly rising and falling. It is a swarmless, serene sight beneath the waters... Your hand is cut by a strange force, but you already establish resonance with the ancient Order using the "right angle."
::'''Swarm Universe:''' You exude a heartfelt smile: Mortals would only be exalted in death, no matter how they lived.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Preservation|Preservation]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Preservation|Devote yourself to saving him!|You are too late.}}
::'''Swarm Universe:''' You also jump into the sea with a resounding splash! Your vision underwater is muddled, but you can see kaleidoscopic rays of light enshrouding the drowned &mdash; after his death, the drowned would be known for having the most moving and holy of voices that ever harmonized for gods in the ancient era.
::'''Swarm Universe:''' You exude a heartfelt smile: Mortals would only be exalted in death, no matter how they lived.
