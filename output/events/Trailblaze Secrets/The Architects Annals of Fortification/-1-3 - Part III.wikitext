{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' You pass by the foot of the Architects' wall where a sturdy statue can be seen before the city &mdash; except it is breathing. His body is old and massive like a wall, his whiskers grown long as time itself. Travelers passing by thought of setting his beard on fire to clean him up, but he always declined their help.
:'''Ember Universe:''' Finally, he sees you and recognizes you as a familiar friend. His eyes shimmer with a faint ripple of shock, but as an ancient wall statue... he is already too decrepit to move his feet anywhere.
:'''Ember Universe:''' "Outsider... I've been waiting for you. The Trailblaze, I know you." He mumbles. This Architect has been awaiting the return of the gondola all this time, "Three times... I've met you. The Trailblaze can traverse stars for eternity. If you happen to meet her, could I ask you to help me tell her... not to go...?"

:'''Ember Universe:''' You bid him farewell... and make for the distant stars with his love in tow. He stays where he is... His language is one of an ancient wail: No one knows better than him that, in a sea of wild embers, waiting takes far longer than immortality itself.
