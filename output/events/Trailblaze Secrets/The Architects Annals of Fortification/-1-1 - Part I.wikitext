{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Origin Universe:''' You encounter a giant Architect who is lounging lazily under the sun... You read some mottled carvings on the sole of his feet that read: They were called "Bigfeet" by humans. The sound that comes from his mouth is powerful, and you can't make out his words.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Elation|Elation]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Elation|Plant the Synesthesia Beacon on him.|Heh, let's give his beard a braid, and then insert the beacon there!}}
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Destruction|Destruction]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Destruction|Scratch his heel with the Synesthesia Beacon.|Even though it's hard to distinguish where his heels are...}}

This Architect claims they got a warning from the hammerings of [[Qlipoth]], and are repairing the barriers of multiple star systems urgently. However, he knows not for what reason, and decides to pause what he is working on.
:'''Origin Universe:''' He uses a giant foot to stamp a crater in the ground, then invites you to rest in it together. You shake your head, sigh, and leave...
