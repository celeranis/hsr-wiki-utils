{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ember Universe:''' After the destruction subsides, a group of "Sin Thirsters" emerge from the void, feeding on the sense of guilt. They appear fleetingly, and dance around in jubilation, having gained a new lease on life. They represent the souls of the deceased: the Swarm that has died and been reborn, and the civilizations that have been destroyed and reconstructed...
:'''Ember Universe:''' As a Sin Thirster shifts and transforms like smoke, it eventually takes on a hunched human-like form. When it lingers near you, you detect both an alluring fragrance and the scent of blood.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Destruction|Destruction]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Destruction|Eat it up!|Doesn't it know that it's just a mass of gas?}}
::'''Ember Universe:''' You feel as if you have gulped down a mass of air as a Sin Thirster stirs within your stomach, leaving a flavor resembling that of a *Stink Fruit*.
::'''Ember Universe:''' Somehow, your actions seem to have agitated it. It alters its appearance and introduces itself in silence as a soldier imbued with "joy," and a Self-Annihilator who has forgotten how to erase itself from existence.
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Nihility|Nihility]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])
:{{SU Special Dialogue|Nihility|Tell it its name when it was alive.|Names are masks created by the living for their own emptiness.}}
