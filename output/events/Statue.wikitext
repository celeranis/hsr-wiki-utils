{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' In between the red rocks in Insumousu, you discover the white stone sculpture of a human head. Its size is just right to be held in your fist. You read the inscription on the stone platform that says, "{{Rubi| Yaoshi|Aeon of Abundance}}."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' On the spur of the moment, you wrap your fingers around the sculpture, feeling it transforming into a bird in your hand. Its longevity proliferates and expands in a visualized form. Then, scarlet liquid flows through your fingers.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "...All sentient beings... will have all their wishes fulfilled... torment and healing... are in a symbiotic relationship..."
