{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' This is your second day after being promoted! Staring at the towering IPC branch building, you are determined to become an excellent senior IPC staff.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You hear that some employees were secretly fired due to work-related mistakes lately, and this has put everyone at the branch on edge. Nevertheless, you are still immersed in the belief that you will be promoted in the future. Reaching level P-35, branch director, should be your lifetime goal! Although P-35 still has a long way to go before you reach the headquarters' gates, it won't be a problem for a young talent like you!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Hmph... You flip through the overview of the IPC's big shots in the Interastral Peace Handbook. Under Arita's leadership, the Traditional Project Department has been mockingly dubbed the "retirement home". Mtooyin Raj Zazzad? She only knows how to come up with plans that award employees in the Talent Motivation Department with petty benefits... You become more and more audacious and confident... P-35? No! You believe you can even one day challenge level P-48, the *Madam Scarred Eye*!
