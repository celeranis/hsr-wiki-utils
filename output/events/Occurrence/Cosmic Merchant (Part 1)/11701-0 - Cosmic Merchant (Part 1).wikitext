:'''Simulated Universe:''' You arrive at the busiest bazaar in Varunix. One of the stalls catches your attention. The stall owner's face is obscured by the hood he is wearing. He sits cross-legged on a purple floor mat with various mineral bottles displayed around him.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "I'm the disciple of Oswaldo Schneider. Both of us are from the Fanaticism Department of IPC!" The man says out of nowhere. "Do you know how commercial activities in the cosmos started in the first place?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was to earn more galactic currencies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does the knowledge of economics help you earn money?
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Of course. It all started from our belief in [[Qlipoth]]. To help the Aeon in building the wall, the support team needed materials from different places across the universe. We learned to exchange resources during that time," he says while scratching his face. "Now, let's try to exchange something. I guarantee you that whatever you've spent won't be in vain."
