{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You notice [[Ruan Mei]]'s virtual image swaying gracefully. She hesitates to speak while gazing at a blurry image generated in the derivation.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Only the silhouette of the massive image is outlined clearly under the sun... The Ambers are gathering at the Aeon's wrists due to their rage! The Ambers are shaking and popping, and their trajectories are like a giant hammer that is commanding a huge stone mortar and pestle. You cannot see anything more. There should be more behind the silhouette of the image...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Get closer.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You reach for the cheeks and feel something splashed onto your face... The sensation isn't pleasant.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You can't see it anymore! You try using your other senses... With your eyes closed, you focus on your hearing: The Aeon's giant hammer falls, but what shakes the earth is not the thunderous sound, but the lifeless whimper of the thing that is hammered. From the sound, you hear what sounds like subtle laughter or the symphony of numerous sounds...
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You cannot understand the Aeon's voice! There are more than one, two, or three voices!
::'''Simulated Universe:''' At that moment, an odd feeling strikes you, and you perceive a subtle sensation! The Propagation is being diluted... Their death is similar to a blot of light-colored ink that spreads out in the ocean. The Preservation is stripping the Aeon of their broken shell, body, and heart... Next, the second concept is extracted... The Aeon is being further diluted, and the collective power is escaping from the disintegration. More forces, whether violent or calm, are disintegrating them...
::'''Qlipoth:''' The scene is a mind-blowing one. The Suns are abnormal, as they are more in number and higher in temperature than normal! You discover that... the giant hammer has conjured up a storm of rage!
::'''Qlipoth:''' The trembling of the shell folds and the Aeon's sound is overshadowed by the splattering of colorful blood. The primordial eggs, bearing fangs and antennae, escape and slip away, only to perish immediately upon leaving the Aeon's body! The ground is covered by their fluid, as a grand labor takes place in the middle of fervor and death &mdash; amidst the forbidden dispersal and joyous escape of the eggs!
::'''Herta:''' "...Keep your distance, (Trailblazer). You'll be affected by the Preservation... should you get too close."
::'''Tayzzyronth:''' The glow wanes beneath the bluish-green moon. {{Color|Keyword|They seem to be... falling}}.
::'''Ruan Mei:''' ...
::'''Herta:''' ...
::'''Herta:''' "Amazing... Your performance exceeds my expectations..." [[Herta]] can barely contain her surprise, but she dares not speak too loud. So, she whispers, "Now, we can only load the image of Amber Lord at this moment! It doesn't matter. I'll record everything."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there more?
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You follow the violent storm conjured up by the giant hammer and come into contact with the tattered white cloth... There are several puzzle pieces that sway with the wind... Under the blazing sun, the blurry figure resembles a massive and silent statue. Under the immense pressure...
::'''Simulated Universe:''' ...You can't get close to them, so you can only kneel in silence. Finally, you realize this is the moment... You can only capture the slightest fluttering of the symbols when they are spilled into the realm of reality like specters. Mortals simply cannot discern or comprehend the language of gods. They can't even distinguish the sound of a god's hammer and whimpering.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stand further away.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You move further away...
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You can't see it anymore! You try using your other senses...
