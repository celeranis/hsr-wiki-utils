:'''Screwllum:''' "Question: Do you have a possibility to interact with [[Aha]]?" While you wait in place, [[Screwllum]] speaks in a polite tone, "I laud the equality and exchange of ideas among the organic lifeforms, inorganic lifeforms, and Aeons."
:'''Herta:''' "(Trailblazer), are you still waiting for the Aeon's response? It's so boring. Let's play a game." [[Herta]] snickers. "Who do you think can get along with Aha the best?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Screwllum.
::'''Herta:''' "I suppose Screwllum doesn't communicate with Aha in the same way as we do. I can see where you come from..."
::'''Aha:''' You continue to wait in place, and you swear you can't force out a laugh. Just as you are rolling your eyes, they finally arrived! A massive fake data storm erupts around them as soon as they appear. They are eager to make you happy, but all you can do is roll your eyes. Yet, when you notice they demand you to laugh, you have no choice but to stretch your mouth into a fake grin.
::'''Aha:''' "Hi, [[Akivili]]! You play the ball well. ♥" Aha starts complimenting you, "Since you're an expert in playing the ball, could you tell me who made it? Oh, hold on. They are coming. Let us put our hands together and salute the great one!"
::'''Xipe:''' They are coming? While you are still confused by what Aha said, a grand parade begins all of a sudden. Your surrounding turns boisterous and lively, but you start screaming in silence. A warm current stirs within you as tens of thousands of eyes gently gaze at you invitingly.
::'''Xipe:''' You believe that rainbow-colored ripples stir to life between their fingers. Your emotions are soothed as you navigate through the puzzle pieces and the multiple facets and ideologies of modernity. You believe you are in their arms, and you have become one of the children of this united will! You hesitate slightly, yet you cannot resist, and even yearn for more of them and their embrace...
::'''Xipe:''' <span style="color:#6f7cda">Akivili</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">The Trailblaze</span> Is that you? We thought you were <span style="color:#6f7cda">dead</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">missing</span>. Countless <span style="color:#6f7cda">destinies</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">histories</span> have shaped the universe's <span style="color:#6f7cda">trajectory</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">direction</span>. We nearly <span style="color:#6f7cda">believed</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">judged</span> that you had become its <span style="color:#6f7cda">nourishment</span> / <span style="color:#ad5e68">footnote</span>.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} <span style="color:#6f7cda">Xipe...!/</span><span style="color:#ad5e68">You do have</span><span style="color:#6f7cda">/many faces</span>
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Who doesn't?
:::'''Aha:''' "Oh, the mother of all stars!" Aha starts the compliments, but the words make you uncomfortable. "As long as what you want to do is fun enough, even if it's a baton game! Changes happen rapidly. We were still negotiating last time, but this time, [[Ena]] already became you. It's a shame, my friend! But I must say Ena makes you look even *better*."
:::'''Herta:''' "Okay... stop. I'm not surprised to see Order being assimilated by Harmony." Herta spreads her hands. "But I just don't know when it happened. Could the disappearance of the Order be related to the battle among Aeons? Ahhh, The Family doesn't say a single word about it... I'd really like to meet Ena again, although they are a bit rigid. Oh, (Trailblazer), if I have to tell someone about this gossip, I'd say [[Xipe]], Aha, and you have come together because of [[Tayzzyronth]]!"
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} <span style="color:#6f7cda">It's me!/</span><span style="color:#ad5e68">It's you!/</span><span style="color:#6f7cda">It's them!</span><span style="color:#ad5e68">/It's everyone!</span>
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' No, you're Akivili!
:::'''Aha:''' "Oh, the mother of all stars!" Aha starts the compliments, but the words make you uncomfortable. "As long as what you want to do is fun enough, even if it's a baton game!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stephen Lloyd.
::'''Herta:''' "That brat! I always think he can hit it off with Aha using his whimsical ideas. They aren't something normal people can understand anyways."
::'''Aha:''' You continue to wait in place, and you swear you can't force out a laugh. Just as you are rolling your eyes, they finally arrived!
