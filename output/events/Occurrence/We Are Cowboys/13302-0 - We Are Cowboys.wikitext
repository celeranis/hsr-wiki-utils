:'''Simulated Universe:''' "We're the last cowboys!" Shouts the leader who flails his arms happily. The red ibis armbands indicate their submission to the royal family. You believe they are the royal bandits.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Leave your gold coins behind. We need funds to oil the development of the city. Generosity is in line with the cowboy's spirit!" Scowling at the shameless bandits, you bite off the grass with your mouth...
