{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You step into a natural program simulated by the recursive formula and notice a black box on the ground. You open it to reveal the holographic image of a physician &mdash; he has the body of a serpent below his waist.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' His dark green scales rustle and reflect a metallic glint as he moves its tail. "Hiss..." He speaks. Thanks to the Synesthesia Beacon, you can slowly understand his language.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Xuange was destroyed by [[Lan]]'s Lux Arrow 62 light years away. [[Herta]] observed the incident and nurtured my spiritual form in the Simulated Universe." A kindling emerges in the physician's hands.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "My existence is Nihility... I do not have the authority to terminate the black box. I've tried to get out of the defensive walls, but I've only managed to send the self-extinguishing kindling outside the black box. I hope you can take it and see my belief through."
:{{DIcon|Star}} Accept the flames of "Self-destruction" and destroy the black box. &mdash; Obtain 1 random Negative Curio and a 3-star Blessing.
