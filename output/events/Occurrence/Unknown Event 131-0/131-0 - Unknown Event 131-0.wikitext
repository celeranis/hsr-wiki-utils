:'''Herta:''' "What's this, a gathering of Geniuses? With this lot?" [[Herta]] snorts. "Everyone's got their own agenda &mdash; it's so hard to get people to work together. We still have to rely on the Simulated Universe in the end &mdash; I mean, when do we pay our respects to [[Nous]]? Honestly though, I doubt I can restore their brain. I just want to see them again."
:'''Ruan Mei:''' "Hold on, Stephen hasn't connected yet." [[Ruan Mei]] says.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can see him?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't wait for those who are late.
:'''Herta:''' "If you wait, he won't appear. I know this little brat." Herta sighs, "We need to scare him! Stephen Lloyd, can you hear me? Come out and meet (Trailblazer) &mdash; for the Simulated Universe, don't be afraid. Ruan Mei and [[Screwllum]] are not here."
:'''Stephen Lloyd:''' "..."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You see a suspicious shadow appearing...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Pretend not to know his true identity...)
::'''Herta:''' "Yes, that's right. Reassure Stephen." Herta stifles a smile. "Get used to it, as we all have to coddle him. He loves that middle-aged look."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Virtual mustache still twitching, he wraps his fingers gingerly around his overall's buttons. But when he locks eyes with you, he still hides behind Herta in fear.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Greet Stephen.)
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' His virtual image nods, as if to salute you.
:::'''Herta:''' "The next time we meet, I'll try to get Stephen to take his disguise off." Herta clears her throat. "Screwllum, you there?"
:::'''Screwllum:''' "I never left," Screwllum's says. "(Trailblazer), allow me to escort you. My deepest gratitude to my comrades in science. With the current research on Nous, I hope we can unearth the history of these machine monarchs and investigate the source of inorganic life. Conclusion: The Simulated Universe's journey begins this very second."
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are there any inorganic lifeform that you do not know of?
:::'''Screwllum:''' "Naturally." Screwllum says. "IPC is wary of inorganics due to the two Emperor's Wars. To this day, I have always endeavored to bridge relations between machine and man."
:::'''Herta:''' "Everyone knows of Screwllum's extraordinary merits." Herta is lavish with her praise. "All right. We'll adjourn the meet-and-greet here. It's getting late, and we should set off, (Trailblazer). But I have to remind you &mdash; unlike [[Tayzzyronth]], every Genius here has paid their respects to Nous, so we know &mdash;"
:::'''Ruan Mei:''' "We know that this trip will be arduous." Ruan Mei finishes her sentence. She coldly adds. "Because our every step... treads right into their calculations."
:::'''Herta:''' "Including this experiment? I don't mind." Herta anticipated that and snickered.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Compliment his cute avatar.)
:::'''Herta:''' "No no. You have to say that his avatar is mature... But what kind of middle-aged person even wears overalls?" Herta smiles midway through her sentence. "Stephen wants me to say: Thank you."
:::'''Herta:''' "The next time we meet, I'll try to get Stephen to take his disguise off." Herta clears her throat. "Screwllum, you there?"
:::'''Screwllum:''' "I never left," Screwllum's says. "(Trailblazer), allow me to escort you. My deepest gratitude to my comrades in science.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Why did he grow a beard?)
::'''Herta:''' "He doesn't want anyone to know he's just a brat." Herta waves her hand dismissively. "And a Genius brat at that! Don't worry, Stephen. Social anxiety is an illness. You'll have to treat it sooner or later."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Virtual mustache still twitching, he wraps his fingers gingerly around his overall's buttons. But when he locks eyes with you, he still hides behind Herta in fear.
