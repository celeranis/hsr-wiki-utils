{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' In the common bathroom of the motel, you run into Leo again. He has a white angel halo on his head, and his body is made up of white gel. Holding a book with his tiny tentacles, he smiles at you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Using an aberrant voice, he starts reciting the theory of happiness. The guests nearby all stick their heads out to listen. Suddenly, you realize that the guests are all brainwashed by his recitation...
:"I'm Leo, an angel. My brother is a devil. Which one do you want as your neighbor?"
