{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' This is your third day after being promoted! For some reason, you have become the owner of all the space in the entire high-rise!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You pin a self-made level P-35 badge on your chest, thinking it's time you show off your accomplishments to everyone!
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The most well-known figures in the universe, such as Louis Fleming and Oswald Schneider, were once out of your league. But now, you believe you can replace them in the future!
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Nihility|Nihility]] in [[Simulated Universe: Swarm Disaster]])

:'''Simulated Universe:''' None of the big shots responds to you! Suddenly, you come to terms with reality... You take a puff of cigarette while staring at empty space, then walk back along the deserted street... At last, you lean on a cement pillar, looking low-spirited and crestfallen.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Indeed... this is not the outcome you have expected. What did you do to make things so wrong? You wish you could start everything over. Perhaps, you would have chosen a different path in the beginning.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' ...You slowly lose consciousness. As it turns out, all employees consumed by greed are subject to a mysterious treatment that will turn them into portraits on the walls of the IPC's secret conference room.
