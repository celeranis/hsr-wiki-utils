{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Alright, everyone is here." [[Herta]] clears her throat and says, "We've finally gathered at the Cogito Hair Salon in the Mechanical City, though it's just a simulation! Now, let's get a haircut. Oops, sorry, we've got to talk about something while getting our hair done."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Affirmation: We need to constantly re-affirm our Intra-Cognition during our journey in the Simulated Universe," says [[Screwllum]]. "(Trailblazer), we wonder whether your Intra-Cognition has changed during this wonderful trip. If your Intra-Cognition is swayed by the test, you'll see yourself as a machine, and that's not what we hope to see."
:{{DIcon|Star}} Adjust Intra-Cognition &mdash; I am organic. &mdash; Increase Intra-Cognition by 40.
:;(Increase Cognition Value by 40)
:{{DIcon|Star}} Adjust Intra-Cognition &mdash; I am inorganic. &mdash; Decrease Intra-Cognition by 40.
:;(Decrease Cognition Value by 40)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Conclusion: Some memories have resurfaced." Screwllum smiles and sinks deep in thought. "Once upon a time when the organic and inorganic lives were not at odds, they would sometimes find themselves hardly distinguishable." He fishes out several components from his pocket. "These are emotional components, and some of my machine friends reside within them. You can pick one as your souvenir."
:{{DIcon|Star}} Agree with [[Dr. Ratio]]. &mdash; Obtain 1 Blessing(s), 1 Curio(s), and 50 Cosmic Fragment(s).
