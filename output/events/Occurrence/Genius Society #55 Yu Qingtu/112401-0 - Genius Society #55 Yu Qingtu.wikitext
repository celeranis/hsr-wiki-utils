{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You arrive at a strange restaurant in outer space. In the building built with red bricks, there are some Bavirus, Foxians, and humans. There is even a Diting sitting at a long table.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Yet, some exiles dressed in gray prisoners' robes are here too... The sight of the shackles on their feet makes you shudder. You bypass them and walk to the bar with its comparative safety.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "We specialize in exotic cocktails." The waiter speaks in an odd tone. "Out of all the cocktail recipes left by Genius Society #55 Yu Qingtu, only 25 of them have been passed down to this day. Three of them are available here, but we can't guarantee whether those involve her toxic concoctions. Which one would you like?"
