{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You wait in place, hoping you can keep up with [[Lan]]. As time slowly slips by, nothing happens.
:'''Herta:''' "I've forgotten to tell you that {{Color|Keyword|Lan hadn't emerged at this period}}." [[Herta]] starts plucking out the flowers on her head one by one as she continues, "The fall of the Propagation took place a long time ago. It was way earlier than Lan's birth."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So Lan has nothing to do with this matter?
::'''Herta:''' "Obviously so." Herta explains perfunctorily, "Your effort won't go to waste, as the Simulated Universe might reveal some traces of the Path that aren't recorded in history. Still, Lan won't be coming..."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "Lan won't be coming..." You ruminate over this as the words invade your mind. The thought flashes all over, throwing your senses off-balance as though you have just downed a bottle of sedative. Next, Herta's voice gradually fades away while chaotic and delusional images wreak havoc in your brain...
::'''Simulated Universe:''' They won't be coming... but you still long to meet them. Make a prayer to the universe, and you might see them in three seconds...
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You open your eyes and find yourself in the middle of a colorful gallery! While the blue-skinned elderly historian is out, your long-accumulated desire for greater swiftness in {{Color|Keyword|The Hunt}} overpowers your other impulses. You quickly absorb numerous paintings, their petals changing colors like the cross-section of spring... The imaginary kingdom grows stronger in the accelerated flow of time.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' Moving through the paintings, your senses' demand for knowledge elevates to a burning desire, and your intuition creeps through your brain like a brightly-colored crab. At last, you stop before the craziest painting of a {{Color|Keyword|gondola}} in odd colors. In the boundary between the virtual and the real, you even feel the urge to sacrifice yourself in return for the truth behind the fall of the Propagation...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Why did they have to die?
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' With The Hunt's instinct, you find the page with the answer &mdash; it is the expansion of concepts! Their descendants have gobbled up too much food... They have disrupted the Order of the universe... They have threatened the Equilibrium of the universe... They have blocked the way of the Trailblaze...
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' These... are their sins.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Fine then, but I still want to see Lan.
::::'''Herta:''' "I've told you that isn't possible." Herta scrunches her nose and adds, "Unless I change their date of birth with the modifier, but what's the point in doing so?"
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Fine then. Will I get anything from the Simulated Universe?
::::'''Herta:''' "You'll get paid whatever you ask for," Herta chuckles. "Just keep playing."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Why were they born?
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' With The Hunt's instinct, you find the page with the answer &mdash; it is a blank page. The book is written in reverse chronology, with the ending predetermined. Yet, the cause can be made up arbitrarily. Whoever is the poor soul that is manipulated will have no bearing on the big picture.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Fine then, but I still want to see Lan.

::::'''Herta:''' "You'll get paid whatever you ask for," Herta chuckles. "Just keep playing."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I miss being pierced through by their arrows!
::'''Herta:''' "Don't get too attached to an Aeon." Herta frowns at you with disgust. "Although you can't meet Lan this time, your effort won't go to waste, as the Simulated Universe might reveal some traces of the Path that aren't recorded in history. Still, Lan won't be coming..."
