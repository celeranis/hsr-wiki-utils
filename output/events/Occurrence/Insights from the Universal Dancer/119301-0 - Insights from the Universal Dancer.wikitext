{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A Foxian dancer approaches you. She makes a mischievous shushing gesture at you before lifting the curtain to the hall for you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Before these seven pots of incense kneel countless dancers from all over the stars, who are getting madder by the day. They prostrate themselves before the meeting hall, and sing and pray to the 13th self-strangler - there are already 13 of them. The dancers will lie prone before God, pleading to know their end after the cosmic dance ends."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Here's a talisman about your fate. If you don't believe this type of thing, just treat it as a famous rumor of the cosmos."
