{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You encounter a doll whose body is three times as tall as its head. It has straw-like hair made of ropes and a counter on its stomach.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You open its manual, which reads, "This is a doll to vent extreme emotions on, made by [[Aha]] in their own likeness. They wish to see themselves beaten up. The worse the beating is, the happier they will get, and the more Gold Coins they will award you! Note: Aha is not involved in the quality control process."
