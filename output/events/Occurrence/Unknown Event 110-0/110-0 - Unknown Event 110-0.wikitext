{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You wait in place, eagerly hoping to meet the god. However, time goes by slowly, and nothing happens. You feel hair starting to fall, and your life is passing away... A scene pops up in your mind where your thinning hair starts growing wildly and becomes long enough to wrap around your wrists and ankles as a result of the Aeon's nurturing... You nearly laugh out loud in elation.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Unfortunately, the Simulated Universe makes your mustache grow and turns you into a disheveled person. The hair isn't growing where it is supposed to be.
:'''Herta:''' "How boring." [[Herta]] shows up, looking bored. "How about we talk about gossip? Stephen Lloyd is a weirdo. If you run into him in the Simulated Universe, you might see him appear as a middle-aged guy."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I tease him?
::'''Herta:''' "Why do you ask me?"
::'''Herta:''' "Anyway, just pretend you don't know anything. He might be upset if you expose him." Still looking bored, Herta continues, "As for the Aeon of Abundance, I suggest you stop waiting, as they are unlikely to show up."
::'''Screwllum:''' "Negative: There are possible relations between Abundance and Propagation." [[Screwllum]] makes a sudden appearance.
::'''Herta:''' "Oh, by the way, there's something fun &mdash; Screwllum and I are in a betting agreement." Herta pursed her lips and adds. "Screwllum is of the view that the Path of Abundance might have been related to [[Tayzzyronth]]! As for me, I think [[Yaoshi]] didn't even exist at that time. (Trailblazer), do you want to place a bet?"
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Count me in!
:::'''Screwllum:''' "I'm honored. This is going to be interesting," says Screwllum.
:::'''Herta:''' "Hmph! Let's wait and see."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Never mind.
:::'''Ruan Mei:''' "I don't see the point of the game." [[Ruan Mei]], who is reticent, finally speaks.
:::'''Herta:''' "Hmph! Let's wait and see."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is he a middle-aged guy?
::'''Herta:''' "No, Stephen Lloyd is just a kid, one who names his Yellow Ducky showering toy the same name as him."
::'''Herta:''' "Anyway, just pretend you don't know anything. He might be upset if you expose him." Still looking bored, Herta continues, "As for the Aeon of Abundance, I suggest you stop waiting, as they are unlikely to show up."
::'''Screwllum:''' "Negative: There are possible relations between Abundance and Propagation." Screwllum makes a sudden appearance.
