{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You enter a dimly-lit motel on Layton. At the stairway, you meet a massive guest who looks intimidating. Its body is formed by a transparent gel-like substance, and it has two heads knocking each other &mdash; one of them has red antennae, while the other has a white halo.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You find your neighbor terrifying. It seems like you have to choose between its two personalities.
:"Our name is Saleo. Sal, the older one, is the demon. Leo, the younger one, is the angel. Which one do you want as your neighbor?"
