{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "There is a small glitch, but it can be easily taken care of." It's [[Herta]]'s voice, sourceless, ephemeral. "Entropy appeared in some spherical codes in the system. It is a common occurrence."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "The bundle of codes was a mess, so I packed it up and stuffed it into a Curio," Herta says. "Carrying it around will cause a deviation in your behavioral record, but I will fix it in no time."
:{{DIcon|Star}} Pick an Error Code Curio. &mdash; Error Code Curios will exert negative effects until they're patched.
:;(Obtain a Error Code Curio)
:{{DIcon|Star}} Leave. &mdash; You decide to refuse.
