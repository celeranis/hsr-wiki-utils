:'''Simulated Universe:''' You wander on the snow plains wrapped tightly in a fur coat. A man is coming your way. The tall and slender man has crimson curly hair and a freckled face. He is wearing leather boots and holding a rifle.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' He points at a spherical building in the distance and says, "The pharmaceutical branch of the IPC is hunting biological materials to manufacture precious drugs, and so are recruiting bounty hunters in the Snowland."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "According to a secret source, the S-rank bounty for Snow Plains Yaks comes with a handsome reward. I'm surprised by how cold this place is. Could you lend me your fur coat?" You catch sight of the Snowland Animal Welfare Association badge worn on the man's chest...
:{{DIcon|Star}} Give him the fur you're wearing. &mdash; Discard 1 Curio, and obtain 200 Cosmic Fragments.
:;(Discard a Curio)
