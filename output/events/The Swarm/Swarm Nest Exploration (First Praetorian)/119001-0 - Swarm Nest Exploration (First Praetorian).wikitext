{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You accidentally step into a high-tech, streamlined suspended matrix &mdash; a trap you believe to be used only by the most cutting-edge hunter on the Planet Snowland.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You get to your feet and find yourself landing before the entrance of a lair. You draw the curtain open and recognize the Combatobugs. As ground combat units, they traded their flying abilities in exchange for heavy and rigid exoskeletons.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' These Combatobugs make a sucking sound... You hesitate to enter the lair and hunt for them, as you might find yourself coated in the insects' scent and incur more unwanted attention...
:{{DIcon|Star}} Kill them. &mdash; Enter battle and obtain a 1–2 star Blessing of Propagation. (The Swarm's alertness will be greatly increased)
:;(Enter battle)
::{{Enemy List|Juvenile Sting*4/ATK +%, DEF +%, HP +%, SPD +%, Toughness +%}}
:{{DIcon|Star}} Leave quietly. &mdash; Hope they don't find you. (The Swarm's alertness will be slightly increased)
::'''Simulated Universe:''' You walk away quietly, hoping you remain untainted by the scent of the Combatobugs.
