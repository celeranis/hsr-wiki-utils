{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' It's dusk, and you're standing amid the heat waves. The atmosphere at the mines makes you dizzy, the mineral veins burning like melted butter.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Great Qlipoth, Aeon of Preservation... They can hear our voices." The miners raise and dip their shovels like frenzied animals &mdash; or the faithful.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Someone notices you &mdash; It's the "lead miner" wearing a detector lamp. His arms are dark and muscular, and his lips are in a similar shade of ink. His hearty smile is very memorable. He has a gold tooth that ceaselessly expands and twists in your brain, till all you can see is his "smile" &mdash; His lips and eyes fuse together, like the melting sludge of paint on a palette.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Qlipoth, the blessing of the Amber Lord, preserves these leylines. You can have one of them."
