{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Due to some mishaps, some of the inorganic planetary systems are having problems exchanging resources with the outside world. As a representative of the machines, you attend a banquet held by {{Color|Keyword|Telora Farnsha}}. You are an *undercover*... By adjusting your Intra-Cognition, you are completely convinced that you are an organic life. Now, you need to find out the *mishaps* that have happened to the IPC.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You scan your surroundings and find Telora Farnsha raising her wine glass while articulating her ideas to her guests.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Oh, the influential Farnsha! The conflict between her notorious Guardians and the Associates is no longer a secret.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' To join Farnsha's Guardians, you must go through the hat-award ceremony. All eyes are on you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Accept the hat.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You join the discussion and learn about the key figure behind the mishaps &mdash; Cappon. He used to be Farnsha's closest right-hand man. The relationship between them seemed to transcend a regular one.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' However, soon Cappon encountered some issues &mdash; he failed to pay interstellar taxes on time in his own work. And his mistake unfortunately affected the crucial political system of the Planet Temptra, which holds great significance for the Farnsha faction. You do not know what matters most to Farnsha.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; Love above all else.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; Politics above all else.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' The Borderstar Trade War had already started by then. Farnsha chose to maintain an amiable relationship with the Temptra, her ally. As for Cappon, he's been gone since then.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Someone will take over his business. My relationship with the inorganic lives won't be affected," Farnsha says.
