{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You hear a gunshot! A gunman from the planet of Cyprogo has hit the first organic life in Izmael, the cosmic library. Within but a moment, chaos ensues.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Flip through the sanguine book.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Search for the perpetrator in the crowd.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You ascend the staircase, and along the looping, repetitive steps, you notice scattered, mysterious star-like marks. You contemplate them, and these mottled marks come together to form a sentence: "There is one who will die for you and one to whom you will perish."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You collide with the tumultuous crowd on the stairs. Just before falling into unconsciousness, you almost catch a corner of the candy-colored chiffon dress of *that woman*.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Follow *her* trail.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stay out of *danger*.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' When you open your eyes again, you find yourself being tied to a chair. The woman stands before you with a scalpel in her hand. You do not know the name of your assailant. As she places her index finger on her lips, you read the secret message aloud, "Your death is a crucial part of the plan... This place requires a little bit of... 'Chaos.'"
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You stare at her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You persuade her to kill you.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' She agrees to do it.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' She leans over to kiss your forehead, inviting you to complete the logical loop of this scheme.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I am a good person.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I am her accomplice.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' She killed you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I exist.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I was killed.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' How many people have died in this turmoil? The only thing known later was that the blood spilled had painted all the books and tomes in the library red.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The Candelagraphos even discovered the Finality's writing in a blood-soaked book: {{Color|Keyword|"Knowledge" will be the beginning of "death." "Blood" will dye all the "pages" red}}. The guild made a deduction from this sentence that the grand Sanguine Condolences was a declaration of war by a faction against the IPC.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' But after some time, the deduction was overturned. Cyprogo was confirmed to be part of the ancient Technology Division managed by {{Color|Keyword|De Wayne}}.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Criticize her.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' She doesn't respond.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' She leans over to kiss your forehead, inviting you to complete the logical loop of this scheme.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I am a good person.
