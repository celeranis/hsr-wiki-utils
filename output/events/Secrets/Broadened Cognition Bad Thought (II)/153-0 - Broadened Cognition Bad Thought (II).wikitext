{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Many years following #27 Rubert's death, a human &mdash; an organic life &mdash; visited his grave.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' By the time he left, he had solved the Anti-Organic Equation, or the equation had chosen him. His hands touched nothing, and he mentioned nothing about the answer. However, death was an inevitability when the equation was activated.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' This is a story taking place in the distant future written by a History Fictionologist: The person derived the answer from the equation 5368 times, and every attempt of his succeeded. Yet, no one believed he had solved the Anti-Organic Equation at that time, and he had never activated it. When he returned, he remained just as poor as before.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' From that moment on, he would always have uncontrollable and increasingly intense bad thoughts in his mind.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Not only did the bad thoughts exist in his mind, they also occurred in his limbs and torso. Interestingly, the latter was more frequent than the former.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Read the bad thoughts.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Suddenly, it occurred to him that all organic lives were artificial machines made for deceptive purposes. Meanwhile, he was the only being with free will.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "I must kill all these pathetic organic lives," he declares morosely.
