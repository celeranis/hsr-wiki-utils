:'''Simulated Universe:''' You check out the unfamiliar surroundings... An IPC recruiter stands in front of you with a smile. You realize it is time for you to make a *decision*.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Welcome aboard, newcomer! You must be a spirited organic lifeform! Let me explain the company's structure to you."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Your first choice: following {{Color|Keyword|Telora Farnsha}} from the Public Relations Division. She is known as the "Godmother" her influence is ancient," the recruiter points out in a serious tone. "She has the support of the four major {{Color|Keyword|Guardians}}. They are versed the ancient skill of Psychological Manipulation. Farnsha, who excels in giving motivational speeches, helps IPC expand across the planets.
