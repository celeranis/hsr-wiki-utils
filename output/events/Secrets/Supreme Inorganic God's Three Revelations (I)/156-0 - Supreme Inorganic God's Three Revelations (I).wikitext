{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Following the outbreak of the Borderstar Trade War, the Intelligentsia Guild made a relentless effort to find its cause. It wasn't until {{Color|Keyword|Louis Fleming}}'s retirement speech and at the final stage of the war that they finally found some answers.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' That was {{Color|Keyword|Louis Fleming}}'s last public appearance. It was also at that event the IPC caught sight of {{Color|Keyword|Fuli}}.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' From the vibrant lights they radiated, numerous memories surfaced and disappeared. The past events that were forbidden to be learned and discussed became reality. At that moment that seemed to last for an eternity, the Candelagraphos wrote down three paragraphs about the memories, forming three revelations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; Obtaining the first revelation.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' [[Nous]]' calculation: The universe will undergo three unchangeable moments.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' The Intelligentsia Guild believed the three revelations would lead to an equation.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; Am I capable of saving the world?
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Everything will end, according to Finality's prediction.
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Shortly after, the guild proved the instants to which these memories belonged. Some divisions started carrying constructions in inorganic life zones. Colonization Under the facade of development.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; Am I capable of saving Andatur Zazzalo?
:::'''Simulated Universe:''' Andatur Zazzalo... Who's that? It seems to have accompanied you many times, but you never notice it. No matter who it is, its name is never known by the Simulated Universe. However, its death will be inevitable, as calculated by Nous.
