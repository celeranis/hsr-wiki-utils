{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' When you encounter her once more, she looks at you with an expressionless face. She has just gathered her hair into a bun, and her earrings sway in the midst of the gunfire. Without a word, she waves at you. You follow her candy-colored skirt through the battlefield, and eventually, you arrive at the base of a clock tower.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Nous's calculations are unquestionable. When that moment comes, everyone must die," she announces nonchalantly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I think you've killed me before.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' It's true... Yet, you woke up the next day. Through killings, she grants an end to life or a rebirth.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "I have to kill it &mdash; Rubert." She runs her finger over the tip of the blade and says with composure, "The moment for its dinner party is over, and the moment of its death is here."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "I tried killing you. Many, many times." She continues, "Before that moment arrives, you are unkillable, but when the moment is here, you have to die &mdash; That, is the moment calculated by [[Nous]]."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Intra-Cognition Assessment &mdash; I don't know you.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' It's true... You have forgotten everything in the past.
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "I have to kill it &mdash; Rubert." She runs her finger over the tip of the blade and says with composure, "The moment for its dinner party is over, and the moment of its death is here."
::'''Simulated Universe:''' "I tried killing you. Many, many times." She continues, "Before that moment arrives, you are unkillable, but when the moment is here, you have to die &mdash; That, is the moment calculated by Nous."
