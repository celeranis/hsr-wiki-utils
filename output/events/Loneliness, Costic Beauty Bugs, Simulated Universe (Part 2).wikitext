{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Simulated Universe:''' Time flies. The space worm named Sweet Saliva that you have nurtured has been undergoing immersive learning at the cosmic tea plantation for a long time... When you hear the sound of fumbling at the door, you know it is back.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You open the door and find that it has grown up. Its skin, which was initially green, has faded and is now covered by a colorful pattern that is a mixture of white, yellowish green, and brownish blue hues... They are the signs that Sweet Saliva has matured into an adult bug. It calls out for you... which is the proof of its *love* for you.
:'''Simulated Universe:''' A relieved and sorrowful smile breaks out on your face.
