:'''Simulated Universe:''' "There is a small glitch, but it can be easily taken care of." It's Herta's voice, sourceless, ephemeral. "Entropy appeared in some spherical codes in the system. It is a common occurrence."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "The bundle of codes was a mess, so I packed it up and stuffed it into a Curio," Herta says. "Carrying it around will cause a deviation in your behavioral record, but I will fix it in no time."
;(If embarking on the Path of [[Simulated Universe/Paths#Elation|Elation]] in a Simulated Universe Expansion)
