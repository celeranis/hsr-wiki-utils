==Secrets==
===Butterfly Perched On A Branch===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Have you ever seen a Butterfly Perched On A Branch, pouring out a love song of beauty and affection?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yes. Animals grow in the footsteps of Kephale, and plants sprout from the hanging branches of Cerces. Yet, upon sudden reflection, none could comprehend their wisdom. The heart of the Reason Titan cracks with sorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They wander Amphoreus, collecting the most beautiful scales and feathers from many creatures, creating golden butterflies. Thus began the world's poems of romance, beauty, and love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Their wisdom could rival Cerces in debate, their sculpting shamed Aquila, and their singing silenced Phagousa. Mnestia, what could be more moving than you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the butterfly loved in vain.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the sacred tree did not understand those feelings.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Long companionship stirs the butterfly's heart, so it confesses its love to its creator, but the flustered Cerces flees within the sacred tree. Even when the butterfly weeps blood and dies, Cerces never returns.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even Thanatos, long accustomed to death, sheds tears for the butterfly. Gathering its fragmented soul, Death cast it into a cocoon. Golden butterflies emerge to pursue romance in the mortal world, while a fragile humanoid form is born from the remains of the cocoon.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Go seek love upon the earth. When the time comes, even the silent tree will bloom for you," Janus guides their path forward.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Go weave romance on the earth. When the time comes, even the tearless god will compose your poetry," Oronyx hands them a golden spindle.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The one in the cocoon departs.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They begin a journey around the world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see sheep with offspring wandering the plains, and clusters of humanity singing around the campfire, just as they once did with their creator.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see children running hand in hand, and young men vowing to sail far across the seas, just as they once did with their mentor.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They see birds carrying fruits to decorate their nests, generals offering flowers to young maidens, their love burning hotter than any Coreflame.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From one end of the world to the other, they gather all the love of the earth, and their long, arduous journey finally brings them back to their origin.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They connect the broken chrysalis with familial love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They hang the heart with the love of friends.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They weave the golden cocoon with pure love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The sacred tree opens their path to kin, their branches intertwining with family and friends. Mnestia gives all of themself to Cerces and finally, within the Chrysalis of Gold, receives the whispers of love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the butterfly is reborn from the cocoon, the sacred tree blooms for their lover, and from that moment, they remain inseparable.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Butterfly Flitted Past Window===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Do you know the Butterfly Flitted Past Window, weaving the golden thread of love into this world?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The prince and the neighboring princess eloping, the married couple commanding the battlefield, and the forbidden love between humans and the Titans &mdash; all are brought to life by Mnestia's touch of golden wing dust, bestowing upon all beings the eye for beauty and the desire for love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend status.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend deception.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love will transcend all.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila's gaze falls upon a craftsman in Stymphalia, whose machines make water flow uphill and whose chariots climb sunlit hills.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Appearing nightly as a beam of light, Aquila meets the craftsman in secret. Yet, as affection deepens, so does the craftsman's desire &mdash; to meet his lover by day and boast of her beauty to his neighbors and friends.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ignoring her warnings, he holds her tightly as dawn approaches. When Aquila opens their hundred eyes, blazing flames consume him, and a month of unceasing rain follows.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia's golden butterflies gather the lingering affection, forging it into the craftsman's creations &mdash; creations that chase the Eye of Twilight by day and watch over his lover's sleeping face by night.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May they embrace under the sunlight.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May they rest beneath the night sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' A young warrior is not felled by battlefield blades but by his friend's envy. The murderer carries the cold body home, feigning grief as he weeps before a maiden.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But Mnestia, riding the west wind of death and night, flies into the maiden's nocturnal dream to expose the man's deceit. She stabs a dagger into her enemy's throat, shaves her hair as a sinner, and becomes a vanguard on the battlefield.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the undefeated maiden is never truly alone. A tiny insect always flutters around her, kissing her armor and weapons before each campaign.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As time passes, hair turns white, and the elderly pass peacefully on their beds. Two beetles cross the battlefield, journeying to the garden of the god of love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May sincerity never falter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May steadfastness endure forever.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia, the eternal defender of love and romance.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It drapes an invisible veil over a girl fleeing an arranged marriage, leading her to true love by the sea. It blinds the eyes of a prideful young man, and as all his admirers flee from his sightless gaze, yet one kiss still finds its way to the corner of his lips.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The wings of the butterfly sweep across the sky and earth. Even if the mortal world collapses, children of humanity, do not forsake love brighter than gold!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Butterfly Quietly Departed===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Have you heard that the Butterfly Quietly Departed? Leaving only tattered wings behind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ah, let us speak of "beauty" once more, in tribute to the resplendent eras that stood unshaken. Have you ever been to Paphas? A city that glorifies beauty, where even the esteemed Mnestia once met their match.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The beauty of that girl was extraordinary. Her eyes seemed to hold starlight, and even the prince of Ladon fell into the river from staring too hard. The angered god transformed into human form, competed in a beauty contest, and robbed everyone of their sight to see beauty, while the girl just covered her mouth and giggled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Great Mnestia, I am not even a fraction as beautiful as you, yet jealousy has robbed you of your beauty."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The god had an epiphany.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The girl smiled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The shamed Romance Titan, in their flight, flapped their wings, and the scale powder fell, turning apples to gold. Of course, this is just a clumsy justification by poets, merely a reasonable jest when taken as such.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let's return to Idilia, where a scholar claims to decode true beauty through numbers and geometry, within the temple of Cerces. Using spirals and vertical lines, he charts the shifting paths of the moon and the Thief Star.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia cannot tolerate such arrogance. They weave a melody of raindrops falling on leafy canopies, the sighs of flowers, and the soft flicker of starlight into silken threads that drape over the shoulders of lovers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So who won?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it a triumph of knowledge?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Or a triumph of love?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This poses an age-old riddle. If both pans of Talanton's scale were to fall into the water, which would they retrieve first? What constitutes true beauty? Even Cerces, with all their wisdom, struggles to unravel these enigmas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, Mnestia knows the answer to the converse question.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' What is ugliness? A world marred by strife and bloodshed, where beautiful garments are ripped apart, grand sculptures toppled, and melodious voices stilled.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Great Mnestia, how might we reclaim the eyes you bestowed upon all beings to perceive beauty, and the hearts that yearn for love?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The wings of the butterfly are torn.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The golden glow dims.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the noble Mnestia still tries to flap their wings, seeking an elegant demise, passing the fiery Coreflame to another.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, children of humanity, don the golden remnants, transform from the cocoon to butterflies, and bring back the faded beauty of the fallen gods.
{{Dialogue End}}

===When Fate's Fruit Fell===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate's fruit fell, who will take the first bite, creating a world from the void?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In a time older than the oldest, chaos first spawned forth "existence" &mdash; a jumbled mess where fate's threads wrap chaos' nectar, bearing fruit. The primal Coreflame ignites within this fruit.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus opens their eyes in the darkness, cramped and suffocated by the threads of fate. They outline pathways with their fingertips, and articulate passages with their words, carving out breaths in the vast void.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' These primordial paths define the boundaries of Amphoreus, still sought by countless souls today.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, pathways extend.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Roads and directions are forged.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Prohibitions and closures come into being.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The fruit of fate swells, suspended high, as Talanton breathes softly. Yet, the chaotic black threads are entangled and unclear, slicing through the Titan like blades.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They carve the initial judgment into the fruit's rind, declaring cause and effect, allowing threads to stretch into frameworks that support the world. Where there is cold, there is warmth. Where there is gain, there is loss. Thus, all things can emerge in balance.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' These frameworks become the driving force behind Amphoreus' transformations, causing the light to rise and the heavy to fall.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, laws are established.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rules and justice are engraved.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Judgments and retributions descended.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the world stands still, as things should morph according to the laws, but the "next moment in eternity" never comes until the third Titan stirs from obscurity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Young Oronyx, with their first cry, awakens time. The fruit of fate bursts upon ripening, its viscous chaos spilling out, flooding the empty cosmos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Like a newborn, the world only truly lives after they cry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, time begins to flow.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The past and the future are inscribed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Forgetfulness and remembrance coexist.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Led by Janus, the three Fate Titans delineate time and space within chaos, bestow laws, and mold the embryo of Amphoreus, laying down the cornerstone for all creation.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is universally acknowledged that fate is inevitable. But how did the world function before fate was born? What was the original force? What did a chaotic world look like?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even with the gods' wisdom surpassing that of the mundane, who can unravel such profound puzzles?
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===When Fate's Steps Stalled===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate's Steps Stalled, who walks to the ends and beyond, forging pathways for the deities?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Gate of Infinity carves paths upon the earth, creating walkways through mountains and plains and sculpting riverbeds and valleys for streams.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They guide the sight of Aquila, drawing trails and roads in the sky, enabling the creations of the Eye of Twilight to traverse. The sun rises from the pinnacle of Georios and sets towards the deep, intoxicating seas of Phagousa.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everything is meticulously ordered.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everything finds its rightful place.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the Coreflame of Kephale is lit, taking on the heavy responsibility of creating life, Janus gently nudges the threads of fate, which split into two paths before Kephale. If the first path is chosen, they will make beings of strength and intellect, forming a creation more logically complex than the mythical beasts forged by Aquila.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If the second path is chosen, they manifest as the incarnations of joy and freedom, as boundless as the waves and as ever-changing as the clouds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet, the Throne of Worlds is not satisfied with these paths. They plead for fate to untangle the ropes, letting the threads fall and entwine around mountains, drift into clouds, or flow along rivers into the sea.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus bestows blessings upon the choices of the Worldbearing Titan, stretching forth endless roads.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Each thread is a choice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Each thread is a pathway.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From here on, life possesses limitless possibilities.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, such choices naturally come with costs. Infinite growth of life ultimately invites the compassion of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, Janus entrusts the threads to Thanatos, who steers the longship along the River of Souls, winding them around reeds and blooms, finally tying them into knots at the ends of the west wind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Death hands the life knot back to Janus, reconnecting it with reality. Souls then travel these threads, arriving empty-handed in the afterlife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But guidance isn't always gentle.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Janus too can rage.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They have cut off paths, entangling them into knots to confine Zagreus for the gods. Even the Trickery Titan cannot escape these maze-like doors.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If they jump, they fall toward the sky. If they run, they sink into the marsh. Only when the omnipotent Kephale shows mercy, or glimpses a secret of the future, do they release the cursed Zagreus after twelve days and nights.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Before the footprints of humanity marked Amphoreus, this great deity had already paved the way. Their prior arrival enables us now to reach them.
{{Dialogue End}}

===When Fate Revealed Guidance===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Fate Revealed Guidance, who quietly follows, seeking the gods' footprints?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Do you still desire to reach the world's end? In the Golden Age before the black tide, find Janus' gates amidst the Endless Sea, pass through them, and you can arrive at every nook of Amphoreus. Only the most devout disciples can open them amidst turbulent seas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Fearless Akotos is the last warrior to complete his pilgrimage, according to legend. Janus graces his warship, granting him free passage through Amphoreus's skies as long as he does not venture into Aquila's realm.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Only the gods and the cities of the sky priests are worthy to share his view of the world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Regrettably, you can no longer see that warship. It was ripped apart in the Chrysos War, becoming a meteor in the night sky.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like a bird without feet.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like a shattered pathway.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Gate of Infinity, you stand closest to humanity's fate. You call people to your own foothold, to build Janusopolis that connects all, the heart of the world through which all journeys must pass.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Choose the path of virtue over vice, and open the doors of courage rather than cowardice. As people venture forward on these paths, guided by divine mandates, they craft legacies that will endure through the ages.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The priests of Janus hum softly, invoking the blessings of the god. Fish from the seaside states, carrying the scent of the sea, pass through the gates. Northern beasts, stripped of their fur, are loaded onto ships with ice and snow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Janus, the people offer you flowers and milk, extolling your deeds with "prosperity."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, eras of abundance can wither.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gold too can corrode.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the skies start to dim, who else provides guidance for life?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' You witness the tireless messengers. They navigate the mirror-like paths, extolling the Titans by name. Their steps are as light as birds, conveying messages of life and death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The devoted kin who decided to give up their lives severed the ties of fate from the city-states about to fall, causing paths to crumble. As the mist ascends, even calamity finds itself adrift and directionless.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, it is better than nothing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The black tide and calamity are unstoppable.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' No one recalls the last time Janus descended. The land shattered, the seas engulfed and divided. Only the remnants of the earth remain, trapping humanity like caged beasts.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet countless gates remain open to us, offering the last guidance to the world.

===Carnival of Heaven and Earth===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet has already begun, playing the song of Carnival of Heaven and Earth, celebrating the birth of the Chalice of Plenty.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is the breath of the first pillar, the Earth Titan. One stream rises with the heat, while another condenses with the cold. Before the sky was formed, it fell as raindrops.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The icy rain startles the sleeping earth awake. Their body becomes a vessel for brewing, and their ears ring with the downpour's roar. They then swear an oath &mdash; the land and ocean shall forever oppose each other!
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa, spurned by the earth, can only dance endlessly between heaven and land, drinking ceaselessly. Thus, an unending rain hovers over the skies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The raindrops are their finest brew.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The sound of rain is their laughter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The rainwater is their divine form.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Only when the Scale of Justice intervenes, asking the land to concede half of their realm to carry the ocean between sky and earth, does the rain finally cease.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Every drop that lands on earth will seep down, evaporate, and flow back to Phagousa's divine realm.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But how can the fickle Phagousa obey an agreement? Waves ceaselessly lash the shores, and the drunken ocean calls to earth to join their revelry, but Georios always answers with silence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, the earth's winds repel the ocean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thus, the ocean's winds mock the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even so, in the halls of the gods, the banquet never ends.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Fate Titans enjoy gentle brewing. They often bring warnings and guidance to Phagousa. The Eye of Twilight, drunk to stupor, showers the earth with heavy rain, as Phagousa taunts the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Kephale drinks steadily. The only time they slumbered slightly tipsy, they nearly had their Dawn Device stolen by Zagreus. Nikador loves the sharp taste of the aged brew, and they always brandish their spear after a heavy drink, challenging their kin to deadly games.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia flicks their tongue to taste, falling drunkenly into Cerces' arms. Floating on the water's surface is a two-handled jar filled with warm honey brew, drifting with the river towards the end of the western wind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' You ask about Zagreus? Phagousa loathes them even more than Georios. To trade away the finest brew? Only if they can pull off a trick so clever it makes the ocean burst into laughter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the ocean always laughs.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And Zagreus has plenty of tricks up their sleeve.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa isn't one to hold grudges for long.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The gatherings of the gods are now distant memories. Looking back, one might dismiss them as nothing more than the fanciful tales of poets.

===Delight of Rain and Snow===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet reaches its climax, with the song of Delight of Rain and Snow echoing, celebrating the gods' absurd games.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Raise another toast &mdash; for if you can offer Phagousa a treasure unlike any other, they will gift you a honey brew rare beyond imagination.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila gathers a hundred cold breezes, which Phagousa bottles with frost and the echoes of mortal sneezes. Even the Eye of Twilight shivers at its chill. The sky falls into a deep slumber, and snowflakes drift down like fleeting dreams.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos plucks flowers from the edge of the River of Souls, sending them via a butterfly to the shores. Phagousa collects the dew from the petals' edges, soaking the stamens, and the fragrance is infused with the scent of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that Zagreus once stole this honey brew to poison Kephale at a banquet, but the all-knowing gods outwitted them, swapping the golden goblets and forcing Zagreus to reap what they sowed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The God of Trickery suffers terribly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A curse will torment their Coreflame.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Until Death retracts the punishment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But in the legends of Dolos, Zagreus simply transformed into a sea snake and sneaked into Phagousa's palace, then drank the gift meant for Death. Since then, Zagreus can also freely traverse between life and death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Sing with the tides once more, for the sea despises silence.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once sheltered Oronyx, cloaking with endless rain the stars fleeting from the sky. But Oronyx's laughter shone so brightly that not even the deepest ocean trench could hide their light.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Talanton comes to exact justice, the ocean has no choice but to reluctantly hand over the stars they harbored. As punishment, the ocean will forever mirror the night sky, guarding against the playful Titan escaping once again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} These are forced explanations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What bizarre stories.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once went alone to face Nikador when the savage god was launching an attack on Phagousa's city due to humiliation, but the Chalice of Plenty secretly guided their people to brew divine nectar from pomegranate juice.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "If the city were to fall, how could such finest brew be produced in the years to come?"
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The war of the gods raged on, and few dared to face the spears of Strife. But do not mistake Phagousa for being brave. They merely seized the chance to invite an old friend for a drink, forced to conjure such a ruse before the wrath of an enraged Nikador.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dreadful Strife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cunning Ocean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eternal finest brew.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Look, the dazed Phagousa is still singing. The waves are their drunken laughter, and the whirlpools their graceful dance.
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===Waltz of Ocean and Winds===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The banquet will eventually come to an end, its melody echoing the Waltz of Ocean and Winds, celebrating the countless pleasures of mortal life.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Who raised the waves before Mnestia taught the disciples what art is? Who taught people to dance in joy and shout in excitement? Phagousa spread the art of brewing to every inch of the land. Was it merely so that someone would join them in laughter at the banquet?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They hide in the drinkers' cups, participating in the ritual made to them along with everyone else. They swallow expeditionary ships, inviting sailors to revel in their belly, and after the humans get drunk, the god spews them and the ships back onto the shore.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Oh, Phagousa, wherever there's a banquet, there you'll be.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Raise a glass, and partake in the ritual.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pour enchanting libations into the sea.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sing and dance to praise the Titan's renown.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the sea is ever capricious. In their drunken whims, they have overturned warships and cast wanderers onto desolate islands.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' There are also those kins created in half-dreams, molded from coral, reefs, seaweed, and waves. If asked, the Titan has surely forgotten their existence by now.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Some are taller than fortresses, some have two hearts and nine heads, some have teeth that can shatter swords, and tails that pierce stone.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If not for the many heroes traveling the seas, who knows how these creatures would wreak havoc?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They pierce the monsters' eyes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They sever the monsters' heads.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They lure the monsters into traps.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The heroes, too, hold banquets on the boat, their feet tapping rhythms on the deck, accompanied by the spontaneous hums of bards and harpists.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, Phagousa mingles among them. Schools of fish swim beneath the ships and oceanic kins board wooden vessels, bringing treasures and sheep to be slaughtered. Honey brew spills into the sea at feasts, inciting the Titan and fish alike to scramble for it.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Sea breezes blow, and heroes stagger, complaining to the dazed waves.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ah, Phagousa, if not for you, where would all these sea monsters and troubles come from? Besides, those treasures were offerings sacrificed to you before our journey!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The drunken god stirs waves.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The heroes lie awake through the night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Children of humanity, the sea will bless your voyage. So &mdash; even as the black tide swallows the world and the gods descend into madness, do not forget the banquet.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Embark on your hero's journey with song and dance, and meet victory or doom the same way.

===The God Who Fooled Divines===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Caution against The God Who Fooled Divines. Since their emergence, the world has known no peace.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos ripped the earth asunder, swallowing countless souls. Nikador sowed discord, prompting the children of humanity to turn on one another. The majestic Throne of Worlds, wandering in sorrow, wept bloody tears.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Tears hit the ground, turning into droplets. Zagreus, the master of deception, the Coin of Whimsy, embodies duality &mdash; just like the body and its shadow, a smile with tears.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mnestia's most despised Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa's most detested Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton's most scorned Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once pretended to be a Chrysalis of Gold in the temple, worshiped by many, until Mnestia flew into it, and they escaped as a shadow. The furious Titan could only curse the blind priests.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They stole Phagousa's crafted vessels at a banquet, provoking a storm from a Titan usually lost in pleasure.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They also concealed Talanton's scales, disrupting the balance of justice on earth. As the weights balancing good and evil fell to the earth, deceit, envy, theft, and plunder emerged, flourishing in their wake.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Indeed, they attempted to steal the colossal machine known as "Dawn," but their fragile shadow was incapable of carrying the weight of the world.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They had to endure divine punishment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Therefore, Aquila closed their eyes. The omnipotent Kephale shifted "Dawn" to the world's edge, where in the darkness, only Zagreus's ever-reaching shadow marked the trail.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The sinner's punishment lasted twelve days and nights, but would Zagreus' tricks truly cease? The Thief Star in the sky already told us.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It lurks at the year's end, on the last day of the Month of Fortune. Once all Titans have departed, it secretly follows Janus, reversing the guiding paths.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The thief's retribution.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The gambler's rant.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The swindler's complaint.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The gods lost their way for a day, and the world fell into chaos. The calendar now has an extra, nonexistent "Spirit Day," a day of mad scenes such as insects devouring birds and dromases running madly in the seas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As for Zagreus? The gods, in their helplessness, bound a star to them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Whenever they escape from the sky, the falling red Thief Star unveils their path, foretelling an imminent calamity of deception.

===The God Who Teased Mortals===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Beware The God Who Teased Mortals. Their arrival brought relentless turmoil.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The fortune they bring to the world is like a coin &mdash; heads for luck, tails for resignation, reflecting the capricious nature of Zagreus. They delight in seeing the fortunate envied and revel in watching sudden misfortune bring others to ruin.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Hence, even their disciples only turn to them in dire straits, disregarding their boons when luck favors them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This is Zagreus' retribution.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly believes in them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly loves them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one truly respects them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, they meddle with mortals unreservedly.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They bestowed blessings on the city of Marela, turning hair to gold, which, once cut, returned to normal. People bore their golden burdens on their heads until their necks snapped, never willing to shear them off.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They crafted a board game where all could triumph until even the king of Polis gambled away his realm and fled with the board.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In Haerel's mines, they gifted the children there with unnaturally lucky hands for stealing, inspiring priests to teach their daughters pickpocketing and kings to train their sons in the craft of thievery.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their lies could supplant the truth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their fortune could corrupt the purest hearts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their schemes could topple empires.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Perhaps they once performed benevolent acts, like concealing a star at the bottom of a lake to drown a greedy tyrant, or unsettling a hero's chariot to help him evade an arrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But who would place their trust in a schemer more fickle than the ocean? Fate has its Janusopolis, the lands have its Icatus, and even the dreaded Thanatos boasts of Aidonia.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet Zagreus finds no welcome within any city-state.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Of course, the remarkable Dolos is an exception. Enthralled by the exploits of the Coin of Whimsy, they have been engrossed for generations in attempting to recreate grand deceptions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's akin to an insult to their essence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus. How laughable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps this, too, is a form of faith.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Poets opt to see the Titans as deities enamored with humanity. Even Nikador has safeguarded Amphoreus for ages.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But does Zagreus truly hold any affection for us? If profitable, surely even the downfall of Amphoreus would not hinder their dealings.
{{Dialogue End}}

===The God of Displacement & Chaos===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Exercise extreme caution around The God of Displacement and Chaos. Now that even they have fallen, stratagems pervade everywhere.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why did Zagreus disappear without a trace when no blade was thrust into their Coreflame? Could this be merely a ruse, a fake-out death to avoid the battles amongst the Titans and the encroaching black tide, thus continuing to stir chaos amongst mortals?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Their kin, the silver-tongued Spirithief Bartholos, still wanders. What secrets did the Trickery Titan confide to it before their fall?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus' treasure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The insane truths of the Titans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing but falsehoods.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Behold the Thief's Hand strewn across Amphoreus &mdash; Zagreus has embedded their soul within them. Gather all the limbs, piece them together, and resurrect Zagreus the Thousand Hands, with ten times the power of Aquila!"
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Give me a hundred gold coins, and the generous Bartholos will help you assemble them in the same place. Of course, if you refuse, I might just have to take the coins off you myself."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "In truth, the venerable Zagreus merely slumbers, and we all exist within their dream."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Looking to claim the Trickery Titan's treasure? It's all stashed in the nether realm. Sacrifice your life, and in the domain of Thanatos you'll find gold heavier than mountains."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "That elusive demigod is none other than Zagreus' incarnation. She proclaimed it in Dolos &mdash; since Zagreus never lies, it must be true."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can we align our narratives?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Annoyed, the Spirithief departs. "Old Zagreus' secrets are hidden within their legendary tales."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that Zagreus' treasure was spirited away long ago, the thief accidentally killing a deity in his greed. Another tale contends that Zagreus never had any treasure, as they spent everything they obtained just as quickly.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend has it that the fallen Zagreus hides in the baths of Okhema, making it easier to steal honey brews from Phagousa's disciples. Another tale claims that Nikador's madness was caused by Zagreus's mischief.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who spun these tales?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? I'm skeptical.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing about Zagreus can be trusted.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legend states Zagreus' misdeeds could fill the seas. Legend admits these stories are spun by Zagreus themself.

===War That Never Ceased===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us reflect on a war that never ceased, the world's very first war.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the Era Chrysea came to an end in calamity, the strong devoured the weak. A lion's jaws crushed the throat of a lamb, a dagger struck deep into the helpless, and countless corpses flooded the River of Souls, bringing its flow to a halt. Even death faltered, overwhelmed and unable to ferry the fallen.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The mournful pile of bones, crushed beneath the relentless waves, was forged into an indestructible colossus. Rising from the River of Souls, it climbed in a roar onto the land, vowing to unleash divine retribution upon all who were unjust.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador, the conqueror of all conquerors, thus strode across the land with a vow to overthrow the gods themselves.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have heard tales of their carnage against the sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why has Nikador relentlessly pursued the Eye of Twilight for a thousand years? Are they seeking vengeance against the tyrants of the skies for striking down the rebels who dared to reach their heights with their Lightning Spear? Or does the blood-stained warrior aim to challenge the most supreme authority in Amphoreus?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Kremnoans sing that only the fear of the hundred-eyed giant bird, cowering in the clouds, caused Nikador to pursue the Sun endlessly, day and night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Legends also tell of the day Nikador led their countless kin into the heavens. Lances clashed against lightning spears with deafening roars, and the feathers of gods rained down like a storm of iron.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa, arriving to aid their ally, transformed the rain into honey brew, intoxicating tens of thousands of soldiers. The enraged god of war set celestial brew ponds ablaze, covering the twilight with burning clouds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those clouds still smolder.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The war is far from over.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why do the edges of the sky seem dim? Those are the eyes blinded by the Lance of Fury.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Foolish poets play their tunes, conjecturing about the covenant of strife and death. Yet they do not know that glory and victory are the melodies of Nikador. The conflict rages on, as they hunt down each kin until none remains unconquered.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, they cleaved Georios' fortress, cast down the stars of Oronyx, and aimed their blade at Kephale upon the throne.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A war of kings.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A war that was meant to end.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Scars etch themselves again and again into the divine bodies of the two Titans, only to heal and reappear, with no victor after a thousand years. Beneath Kremnos, Nikador has descended into madness, while atop the holy city, Kephale remains in eternal slumber.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the legion of war, clinging to the last vestiges of its glory, still marches toward the distant Okhema.
{{Dialogue End}}
----

===War That Continues to Thrive===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us recall a war that continues to thrive, the precursor to many across the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador forged many divine soldiers and inspired those on the earth to master the art of weapon forging.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The first of these was a spear, created during the creation of Aquila by Kephale. The lightning spear thrust into the earth's spine became a gleaming streak that pierced the heavens after tempering by the River of Souls.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Next came a sword, tempered with divine blood after witnessing the heroics of Gorgo, guarded by the braves of the citadel, it became a blade that pointed defiantly at the omnipotent.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The third creation was a shield, gifted by Thanatos and molded from the nether realm's clay, strong enough to withstand furious lightning bolts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet, this shield has vanished.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Zagreus, in their vile greed, stole and melted the shield into gold coins, merely to barter for a cup of Phagousa's finest brew.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In an age where divine battles raged incessantly, war made sparks upon the shield. Its fragments became the guarded secret of Castrum Kremnos' defenses. Anyway, these ancient shields can no longer be replicated.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But true warriors do not falter due to a lost weapon. Nikador has never been a coward who hides behind shields.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador brandishes their spear, commanding their kin to align in formation. At their fierce battle cry, the kins charge fearlessly into the fray. Neither the surging waves nor the rolling boulders can slow their relentless advance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their formations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their strategies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People learned their bravery.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Just as children learn language and young beasts learn to bite, humans learn to assemble armies, craft chariots, march in formation, and slay their foes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Imitating the divine battles, the children of humanity crafted wars of their own. The fiercest among them gathered under Nikador, offering their blood in ritual conflict.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As the god cast their spear, trails of light across the night sky would guide the people of Kremnos. Following the trail of light, they trample every city-state in their path, until they reach the burnt ruins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As a festival of praise.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As a revelation from the Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At the twilight of the Era Chrysea, no one could recall just how many city-states had once thrived. In the ballads glorifying Nikador, the grim specter of the mobile armed fortresses with a hanging blade became their final nightmare.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The seeds of strife had blossomed into a giant tree, with even the scholars of Cerces learning the knowledge of warfare. From the moment Nikador's imposing form was seen by the people, the unrest never ceased.
{{Dialogue End}}

===War That Lost Its Glory===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us revisit a war that lost its glory, scorned by Kremnoans.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Despite widespread criticism and defamation, Nikador was not the mindless brute many portrayed. They held glory in higher esteem than victory itself.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Consider "Barefoot Freto," who dashed from the coastal town of Silo Kossas, his feet as swift as the sea's waves, blessed by Phagousa.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' He challenged Nikador to a foot race, and his arrogance and pride quieted even the Titan. Nikador laughed heartily and struck a deal: If Freto reached Silo Kossas before their army, they would ensure peace for his homeland.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Running is a grand competition.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But no mortal can outpace a god.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Strife Titan set off nonchalantly, while Freto drew his dagger and ended his life. His soul reached his homeland sooner than the Titan, as neighbors besieged his city and the River of Souls overflowed into the fields.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Awed by humanity's courage, the Titan launched their spear, vanquishing the invaders. For the next century, no tyrants dared defy the sacred pact between mortal and god.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When King Desos secretly brokered a ceasefire with Canor only to betray them, leading his forces from Castrum Kremnos to their gates, Nikador unleashed divine fury on their own people for the first time.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Titan positioned at the heart of the conflict. any soldier bold enough to cross the line would find his shield impossibly heavy, his blade shattering and corroding instantly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Titan preserved the honor of warriors.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Titan safeguarded the sanctity of combat.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Titan's kin dismantled Desos' chariot, strangling the king who disgraced warfare, turning his allies into a blood sacrifice &mdash; a stark warning and a ritual to end the conflict.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' War necessitates victory, yet victory isn't its sole objective. Nikador once upheld such order through intimidating force, fostering a fragile yet cherished peace.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} However, glory had long decayed.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' An eternal night shrouds the mortal realm, and the god now devoid of reason sees every life as an adversary. The defender of Amphoreus against the black tide eventually turn traitor and assistant to the black tide, igniting futile wars.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Nikador, resilient as ever, did you ever anticipate such a disgraceful fall from grace?

===Lullaby For Children to Sleep===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby For Children to Sleep, a bedtime story of life and death's inescapable cycle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It was an epoch beyond comprehension, one we can never return to &mdash; The Golden Age. Predators did not need to hunt and foliage remained evergreen. Thousands of city-states dotted Amphoreus, teeming with beings who knew no sorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the earth could not sustain such a burden. Its backbone shattered into ravines, spewing forth blood that formed rivers, devouring the fallen lives.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' A shadowy arm emerged from the river &mdash; Thanatos, heralding the Era Chrysea's demise with their birth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of exhaustion.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of aging.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From that moment, life became capable of death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Under the watchful eye of the Scale of Justice, they swore oaths with the gods. The River of Souls marked the boundary, where death would balance life in Amphoreus. Departed souls would journey to the realm of Thanatos, boarding the ferryman's long boat to transition from this life to the next.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They were a friend of Oronyx's. When people were weary from the day's toil, the Veil of Evernight would sway their skirts, making the stars twinkle and calling for their arrival.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thanatos quietly descended into the mortal world, gently brushing the brows of the weary with their pinky finger, guiding them into a peaceful slumber.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The soft hum of the nightingale and the gentle flicker of the stars form a hymn to death and time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dreams carry the whispers of Thanatos.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The evening breeze is the breath of Oronyx.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Only by cherishing this moment can one embrace tomorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They once conversed across the River of Souls with Mnestia, as Cerces' divine form was gravely harmed in the gods' wars. Braving the risk of demise, Cerces' partner pled with Thanatos to preserve the fading soul of the Reason Titan.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In exchange, the creations and kin of the couple were offered to Death as a gift. Since then, the realm of Thanatos has flourished with flowers and butterflies.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' As Cerces slept, flowers wilted and returned to the earth, nourishing tender new leaves upon the Titan's return &mdash; reflecting the cycle of souls and the turning of seasons.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is death.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From youth to old age.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From a brief rest to eternal sleep.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Therefore, do not despise Thanatos. They are silent yet gentle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They watch as people live their lives to the fullest. When the curtain falls, they carefully stir the ferry, softly knocking at the door of our souls.

===Lullaby to Warn the World===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby to Warn the World &mdash; a fable of arrogance and absurdity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Let us begin with Thanatos' boat. Mortals have always tried to defy death. The mad King Mikas, and Herostratus who hid in a sarcophagus and entered eternal sleep to escape mortality, only became the laughingstock of playwrights. But the most ridiculous of them all was Pylamans of Mythemis.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' He broke reeds from the banks of the River of Souls, weaving them into a raft to cross Death's perilous waters. He ground gold into a dagger to defy decay and disintegration. Following the current of the dead, he sought to assassinate Thanatos while on the boat and usurp their divine authority.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Look, his body remains warm, his dagger still sharp, yet all he finds is a single long boat.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The ferry of the dead.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The boat is utterly empty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thanatos is nowhere to be seen.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Pylamans leaps onto the boat, calling himself the lord of death. Yet the ferry drifts slowly, carrying him to the other shore.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, who wrote this fable? Maybe the Hand of Shadow has a knack for telling strange stories? Over the centuries, there haven't been many fools as crazy as him, but there's no shortage of idiots who've dared to mock death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It's probably a trick. The queen, having heard the rumor, drew upon water from the River of Souls, believing that any portrait painted with it would cause the subject's death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' She sent her servant to retrieve a scoop of the river's muddy waters, secretly pouring it into the king's clay bowl in hopes of killing the lover who captivated him.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the bowl contained muddy water and nothing more.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The servant dared not approach the River of Souls.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At a grand banquet, the king unveiled a carefully prepared gift for his lover. The queen was greeted by her own smile painted upon the canvas.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The wine glass shattered, and so did the queen's life. It serves as a warning to all: Do not scheme against others, nor let jealousy cloud your vision.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Finally, let us tell a beautiful story.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The nameless hero was framed and killed, his sword falling into the River of Souls. When the river receded, the sword remained uncorroded. Thanatos called the hero's offspring in a dream, who, guided by the vision, arrived at the sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He drew the sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He destroyed the traitor.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He avenged his father.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Years later, the young hero, wielding the sword, led his troops to overthrow the tyrant ruling his homeland, driving the blade straight into the center of the crown.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This reminds mankind that death never covers up evil.

===Lullaby to Return Home===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Listen to a Lullaby to Return Home, about the journey to the afterlife.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The tides of the River of Souls corrode ships, turn flesh to ash, and forbid mortal life. They follow death, flooding battlefields and wastelands, receding only after all the deceased are ferried back to the realm of Thanatos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' If you wish to meet Thanatos, this is where the journey begins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Step into the cold river.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Accept the end of this life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Endure the fading of memories.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' On either side of the shallows, you can see countless restless souls drift aimlessly. Some, having forgotten to bring the coin needed for the ferryman, are cursed to wander the shores for centuries. Others, burdened by unforgivable sins, groan in torment after their forms dissolve, awaiting the final judgment.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' There are also madmen abandoned by death, punished for deceiving the Titan, or cursed with immortality after diving into the river. These undying cursed souls linger on the river's edge, begging the god for mercy, waiting for the rare compassion of Thanatos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ignore them, and you will encounter a butterfly, the messenger of Thanatos, guiding you toward the nether realm.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Follow the butterfly's path.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Keep moving forward.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But beware of Zagreus and their kin. Apart from Thanatos, only they can roam freely in the realm of the dead.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They delight in stealing from the dead. During the bloodiest years of the Chrysos War, gold coins hidden in the realm of death even clogged the River of Souls, causing the waters to overflow into the mortal world. Soldiers scrambled for the gold coins, only to be consumed by the flooding river, leaving a grotesque chapter in history.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When you reach the riverside, Thanatos will have been waiting with the longboat for ages. No one knows their true face, for those who do have already crossed into the afterlife.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may appear as a bird.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may show as a dragon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They may come as a breeze.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They silently extend the Hand of Shadow, accept your payment, and pull you aboard before rowing the oars.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From this point on, even bards speak vaguely. Some say the heroes gather in the realm of death to raise their glasses in celebration. While others say it is a lifeless place, adorned only with endless piles of bones.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' One way or another, you will catch the scent of flowers carried on the end of the west wind, feel the soul's rain cascade upon you, and finally, as a newborn, open your eyes and let out your first cry.

===Giant Bird That Covers the Land===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the phantom night of Oronyx still dominated the sky, in the boundless Evernight, a giant bird whose wings could cover the land opened its eyes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila sensed everything around them. They opened their first pair of eyes, but the dim world prevented them from seeing clearly. Then they opened their second pair of eyes, but darkness still enveloped everything.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' So they opened more eyes, on their head and wings. With each pair of eyes Aquila opened, the world became a little clearer. Finally, when they opened the hundredth pair of eyes, Aquila could at last see the world they inhabited.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When Aquila saw the world clearly, the world was also within their eyes. From their eyes came a blazing and absolute light, outshining the Veil of Evernight and the stars embedded upon it.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The night was over, and the earth welcomed the first ray of sunlight since the birth of the world.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Praise the sun!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Starry skies are still better.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Day granted them radiant eyes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila established their divine realm at the border of Amphoreus. The short feathers on their wings became the glow and flames in the sky. The long feathers were fashioned into thunder and lightning.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Clouds were Aquila's first Titankins. They took the white from their own eyes to create clouds. These kins forever float around their master, but they cherish freedom and are naturally carefree, thus easily indulging in pleasure.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Sometimes, the clouds would be tricked by Phagousa into drinking vintage wine, thus wetting Aquila's feathers. The angry Aquila would then shake their body, casting the wet feathers into the clouds and summoning thunderstorms.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But some poets claim this happened because Phagousa secretly encouraged the clouds to tickle Aquila's nose, causing them to constantly sneeze in the sky.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their every movement affects the weather.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa is a wee bit naughty.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the children of humanity first descended to the world, they looked up, yet lost their sight to Aquila's piercing gaze.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And the divine light emanating from their eyes was so scorching that the earth melted into magma, and plants were charred black from the heat.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila circled across the sky, hearing the countless pleas rising from below. Moved by a tinge of compassion, they slowly closed one pair of eyes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At that moment, the wailing grew a little fainter. So Aquila closed another pair of eyes.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so this continued until Aquila left only a pair of eyes open, the voices of the people turned to praises and cheers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As they say, heed the needs of the people.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} More is not necessarily merrier.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so, Aquila received their revelation &mdash; to create a new Titankin with only a single pair of eyes.

===Wisdom That Crosses the Ocean===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the leader of Kadir encountered that towering, sun-like figure in his dream, he did not yet realize that he was about to be granted the wisdom to cross the ocean.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Long ago, in Phagousa's most unrestrained era, even the greatest coastal city-states could only pray not to attract their fickle favor.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Just as the leader of Kadir led his people to toil day and night, hauling stone and fortifying the dikes, all in the hope that their home would not be destroyed in one of the sea god's wild revels.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the world is fickle, and fate seldom favors human effort. Instead, their toil only amused Phagousa, who, in their playful whim, raised towering waves and swept the dikes away.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The second time, the leader carved deep trenches along the shore, hoping to halt the advance of the waves. But Phagousa's power filled the ravines and surged onto the beach once more.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humans are powerless against the gods.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But he is still a fighter.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Twice defeated, the leader was consumed by sorrow and fury. He roared at the sea, condemning the injustice of this one-sided struggle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa was not angered by his outburst. Taking the form of a great whale, they appeared by the shore and spoke to the people. If the people could cross the sea and reach a distant island within seven days, they would cease their disturbances and even bestow upon them Phagousa's treasures.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But if they failed, the coastline would be swallowed by the ocean forever. With that, the great whale vanished into the depths.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The leader pondered for five days and nights but could find no way to cross the sea. That night, in his dreams, he saw a figure as radiant as the sun &mdash; Aquila.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila told him that by binding sturdy branches together with vines, they could cross the sea.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At dawn, the leader gathered his people and set to work, lashing branches into rafts. On the morning of the seventh day, under the watchful eyes of his people, the leader embarked on his journey across the sea.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A great revelation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A brave journey.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At last, the leader reached the island. But Phagousa, realizing they had borrowed divine wisdom, declared that they would flood Kadir's land with seawater.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In this moment of crisis, Aquila appeared once more to intervene &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "If you must flood their land, do not use seawater. Use the honeyed brew that is your pride and honor instead!"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is divine wisdom?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like Aquila is also a PR expert.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa, pleased by the flattery and amused by the clever words, was instantly satisfied.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From that day on, the warriors of the coast mastered the art of fermenting drinks and, before setting sail, would offer their respects to the sky.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Kin That Praises Perfection===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But when Aquila boasted to Oronyx of their perfect Kin, they were met with nothing but a dismissive scoff.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Is there such a thing as perfection in this world? Your so-called flawless Kin is nothing special."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' How could the proud ruler of the heavens tolerate such doubt?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Blinded by pride and the desire to prove themself, Aquila tore out one of their own pairs of eyes with their beak and cast those &mdash; along with their lightning spear &mdash; into Georios's spine.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not even divinity is safe from pride.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds painful.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From the soil, a child swiftly emerged, with a mind that could think and limbs strong enough to bear the weight of the world. With each breath, their body grew larger, and their wisdom deepened.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Until, at last, the infant became a giant, greater than even Aquila. They sprouted hands to touch the sky and legs to stride across the earth. Their hair turned snow-white, dyed by the clouds, and their eyes became deep blue, painted by the skies.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the omniscient and omnipotent Kephale was born.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A god begets a new god.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That sounds awesome.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, before Aquila could boast to Oronyx of their creation, their path was blocked by an enraged Talanton.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The omniscient, omnipotent creation had disrupted the balance of the world. As punishment, Aquila and Oronyx &mdash; who had encouraged this defiance of cosmic law &mdash; were each condemned to rule only half of the sky, never to cross into the other's domain.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila was ordered to forge a great scale and entrust it to the newborn Kephale. It would be the scale's duty to divide dawn and dusk, ensuring the balance between day and night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When dusk fell, the Sky Titan would be compelled to close their eyes and enter a momentary slumber &mdash; until dawn called them back to wakefulness once more.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet Talanton did not realize that, having been born from Aquila's eyes, Kephale's gaze was naturally attuned to the light of day.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so, in the ages to come, when humankind was born, they too would inherit Kephale's nature &mdash; working beneath the sun and resting beneath the stars.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Daytime energizes people.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nighttime allows people to recuperate and rest.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, Aquila won?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, though the struggle between day and night would never truly cease, by the year's end, their hours would always return to perfect balance.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Praise Their Wisdom===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Countless people praised Cerces's wisdom. They spread their branches and scattered their leaves, letting the roots of reason settle within Georios's body.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Birds briefly veer away from the clouds meticulously engraved by Aquila, swooping down to seize branches glistening with the dew of wisdom. Beasts, too, indulge in rare respite, flaring their nostrils to drink deeply of the forest's awakening breath.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Vibrant colors and vivid movements fill the space between heaven and earth. Those blessed by them prosper and multiply, gathering those golden fruits at their source and presenting them to the wisest scholars in their midst.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is the fruit of wisdom.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So eating it will make you smarter?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, not all Titans welcomed Cerces's spring descending upon the world. The Hand of Shadow from the River of Souls had already crawled up its roots. Thanatos declared with conviction &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Fresh flowers cannot bloom eternal, and eventually they will wilt and become dust and ash. Giant trees cannot stand eternal, and eventually they will decay and become withered woods."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "This is the only way. This is how the world survives without being consumed by the endless growth of vegetation."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Cerces naturally wasn't rageful. The flowers of reason would never wither...
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Then all flowers shall rot into mire, all mighty trees wither to barren husks. Every plant upon this earth shall tremble before the death bestowed by Thanatos through decay."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's life, and then there must be death.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's a beginning, and there must be an ending.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This sounds pretty sensible.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "However... if all the silt and withered branches are cast into the River of Souls, the rivers would eventually become clogged and cease to flow. Should this happen, other living beings would be unable to meet their fated end."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The Hand of Shadow paused, their arrogance tempered only by reason's whisper. Thus, a covenant was forged: all fallen flora would return to Cerces.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They opened their arms to reclaim their lost children and sank into a mournful slumber.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the Reaper did not know Cerces had already murmured to the earth, transmuting decay into nourishment for new life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Death is but the seed of new life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} An impressive demonstration of a feigned retreat.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, in Era Creatura, the land became Cerces's garden.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Later, after a long time, with the arrival of Era Chrysea, mankind established a new citadel on the earth, and this stalled the expansion of that lushness slightly.

===Lament Their Indifference===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' All lamented Cerces's indifference. When Mnestia offered fervent love, they sealed that passion within the amber of rejection.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet love and romance, unrestrained, burst forth like springs, flooding the fields as golden wings. Mnestia's butterflies soared to Amphoreus's farthest reaches &mdash; even to realms beyond divine sight.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Like bees collecting nectar, the wings of love sought rare gifts for the Titan dwelling within the Sacred Tree.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' There were emerald fruits nourished by the first dewdrops of dawn from the tallest olive tree in Stymphalia. Also colorful giant clams that even the bravest, most broad-chested divers of Mileutus could not harvest, with pearls dark as night shimmering within.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even from the seemingly primeval Worthinnis, they gathered several amusing tales. And countless others beyond these.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dark green olives, symbolizing evergreen love.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A black pearl, as if a profound companion.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A good joke never gets old.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But Cerces did not respond to such devotion. After all, even reason cannot fully deconstruct love into logic and philosophical thought.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Like a stubborn stone unmoved by wind erosion or scorching sun, they sealed off their senses. They hid within the sacred tree, concealing all signs of vibrant life. Even flowers grew shy in their presence, curling their leaves at the slightest touch.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then winter came to the world, and the earth lost its vibrant greenery as everything turned pale and weary. Aquila, attempting to awaken the slumbering Cerces, sent down snow and hail, but received not even the faintest response.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Unfruitful love is as cold as winter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Such things are not rare.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In the end, it was still the devoted Mnestia who approached. Wings alighted upon the Sacred Tree, whispering to their beloved within through the sounds of their fluttering.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, the Sacred Tree exuded golden sap, encasing the wings within it. Mnestia's butterflies fell to the ground, covered by fallen leaves and sand, layer upon layer, until they sank to the core of the earth.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This was the amber of rejected love, burying everything in the forgotten depths of the earth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The wings of love are ever so easy to break.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From another perspective, they're technically all condensed together.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Hearing of such a sorrowful past, the later children of humanity would pick up a fallen red blossom when contemplating love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Anxiously, they would pray for Cerces's mercy, plucking petals one by one, deeply fearing that the amber of rejection would seal them in an abyss of hopelessness.

===Sigh at Their Blessings===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' All marveled at Cerces's blessing. It left two magnificent gifts for humanity: one was wisdom and reason, the other the art of cultivation.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' After death appeared in the world, hunger also began to afflict the beings of the earth. The numerous children of humanity, forced to abandon the dignity of being the most exalted of creatures, fought each other like beasts for food.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' To satisfy their hunger, humanity cast aside the reason bestowed by Cerces. To fill their stomachs, they depleted all the wild vegetables and fruits of the forest.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This angered Cerces, who commanded all plants to wither. The starving children of humanity would soon vanish from the earth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humanity forgot reverence and deserved punishment.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those who have never known hunger have no right to blame.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The compassionate Georios pleaded for humanity, and Cerces allowed wheat to grow from the soil.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet for humanity to survive in the world, wheat alone was insufficient. They still needed olives, potatoes, and onions, as well as the sweet fruits that once grew abundantly across the hills and valleys.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' So Cerces imposed their trial. From among their devotees, they selected the most devout young man and gave him a handful of strangely shaped, plump seeds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They proclaimed that they would place a curse upon the young man &mdash; no matter what this poor devotee ate, or how much he consumed, he would never be satisfied, and endless hunger would burn within him like raging fire!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What terrible torture.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a respectable sacrifice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The divine are experts at torturing people.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so the long torture began. The young devotee, a fisherman's son, devoured all the fish and shrimp his father had caught.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, he consumed all the wheat in his home, and the provisions of his neighbors. To find more food, he was forced to leave his homeland. He devoured all the birds and beasts within his sight.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But as Cerces had foretold, no matter what he ate or how much he consumed, eternal hunger continued to torment him.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This painful journey continued for an unknown amount of time. Finally, the devotee exhausted his strength, his spirit and body utterly broken. He sat before a withered tree, sensing his imminent demise.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Using his last ounce of strength, he raised the seeds given by his god, and instead of putting them in his mouth, he scattered them into the air.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He kept his faith.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He wasted the last of the food.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The seeds blossomed with Cerces's blessing in the air, and the withered tree behind the young man transformed into a towering Sacred Tree.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The young devotee had passed Cerces's test. Thus, various crops began to grow upon the earth, and people gathered beneath the Sacred Tree to listen to the teachings of the voice of wisdom.

===Giant's March===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ancient songs passed down through generations tell of that distant past &mdash; the march of the giant Kephale.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is said that the giant was born from the conflict of day and night, and though they accepted their burden without complaint, when they gazed upon the world, they found it desolate.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The vast expanse of heaven and earth lacked the vibrant pulse of existence. Kephale, omniscient, understood in an instant &mdash; the world was missing life.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so, with great strides, the giant set forth, vowing to seek the footprints of life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Life is on land.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Life is in the ocean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Life is organic.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' To search every corner of the world, the giant followed the coastline. Their massive feet sank into the wet sand, sending mud flying in all directions.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mud that splashed into the sea became swimming fish. Mud that struck the land turned into roaming beasts. Mud flung into the sky, dried by the sun, transformed into soaring birds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The creatures born of the mud splashed in the waves, cried out from the earth, and called to their creator. But the giant walked too fast to hear them, leaving them far behind.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Kephale never stopped. With each step, the scale on their back shifted, exchanging day for night and night for day. They never paused, as if the moment they did, they would lose sight of the perfect life they sought.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe they should stop.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe they should turn back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe they should speed up.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The giant walked for an unfathomable length of time. Wishing to grant them a moment's rest, the Three Fates sisters gently draped the veil of night over their eyes, tricking them into believing that night had truly fallen.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Kephale then set down the scales, lay upon Georios's spine, and drifted into a brief slumber. As they slept, a single strand of their hair fell onto a stone. But because the giant continued to ponder the essence of life even in dreams, that strand of hair took root and grew into a mighty tree.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The tree sprouted with astonishing speed, and from it, wisdom and reason were born. Wherever its branches reached, the land blossomed with countless flowers, and even the creatures formed from mud were touched by its essence, gaining a spark of spirit.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The emergence of wisdom.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will one get smarter if they touch it?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the giant Kephale awoke from their slumber, the world had changed beyond recognition. Living beings gathered around the Sacred Tree and their creator, offering thanks for the gift of life.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the giant was bewildered, unaware that this flourishing world had sprung from their own unintentional act. Perhaps this was the one truth they could never fully comprehend.

===Giant's Mission===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ancient songs passed down through generations tell of that distant past &mdash; the mission of the giant Kephale.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The creations of the gods filled Kephale with joy, and the world thrived with newfound vitality. Yet, despite this, the giant remained unsatisfied &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "These beings, for all their beauty, still lack our wisdom. In time, they will crumble into dust."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so, Kephale pondered deeply. Until, in a single moment of revelation, they understood their true purpose &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "I shall make them in my image, that they may bear the spirit of all things."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humanity shall bear the spirit of all things.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They only realized it now? Does that count as a blind spot?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The giant sought out the ruler of the sky, speaking with humble words &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Your gaze is piercing and shines upon all the world. I hope that my creations may receive your blessing, so they may walk freely beneath the light of day."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila smiled and readily agreed. Yet the god of the starry night frowned, turning away in displeasure &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Please, do not be angered. When the stars rise, my creations will need your protection, so they may rest in peace."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Hearing this, Oronyx reconsidered &mdash; and, at last, granted their blessing as well.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Work in the day.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rest at night.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's really tactful.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The giant bent down once more and awakened the earth. Their creations would take form from Georios's divine body.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Then, the giant sought out Cerces, asking them to pluck the fruit of wisdom and grant their creations the gifts of reason and thought. The god born of the Sacred Tree had no reason to refuse, and even brought forth the curious Mnestia.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The goddess of love then flew to the mud figures, brushing their wings over the creations' eyes and gently touching their chests &mdash; so that their eyes might perceive beauty and their hearts might speak the words of love.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Everything was prepared. Yet the giant had not yet given their own blessing. So Kephale cut open their own arm, and golden blood flowed forth. This divine ichor bestowed true life upon the creations.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the first children of humanity came into being.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Congratulations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, that's no surprise.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Humanity, newly created, gathered at the feet of the giant Kephale and built a great city.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And this city, founded beneath the giant, would one day be known as the Holy City of Okhema.

===Giant's Nemesis===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Ancient songs passed down through generations speak of that distant past &mdash; Kephale's nemesis.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Life spread across the land, but in the end, all living things met their death. From death arose conflict, and from conflict, war. As unarmed mortals fell, their souls plunged into the River of Souls, and within the realm of Thanatos, sorrow and hatred festered and grew.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The bones of the dead, fused with the waters of the River of Souls, were shaped by grief into a colossal figure. Beneath the earth, they unearthed the lightning spear that Aquila had once cast down when creating the giant. Tempered in the waters of the River of Souls, the weapon was reforged into the Lance of Fury.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus was born Nikador, the Lance of Fury &mdash; the eternal enemy of the giant.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Life will never yield to wars.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} War will never pity lives.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nemeses will always be nemeses.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The slaughter of countless creations filled the giant with sorrow.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Seeking aid, they turned to the Sky Titan, pleading for the return of the lightning spear, so that the divine weapon would no longer aid in destruction. But Aquila was unmoved &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "That spear has been tainted by the filth of the River of Souls. I will not lay a hand upon such corruption, much less reclaim it."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' With no other recourse, the giant then called upon the god of wisdom, Cerces, to seek counsel. As expected, Cerces devised a plan &mdash;
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "Nikador wields a divine shield, a gift from Thanatos themself. Forged from the very essence of the underworld, it is strong enough to withstand even the fiercest lightning."
:'''Divergent Universe:''' "If you can convince them to strike their own shield with the spear &mdash; one of them is bound to break."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Use thy spear...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} To pierce thy shield.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This story sounds familiar.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the giant journeyed to the River of Souls to confront its sworn enemy. They spoke with carefully chosen words, goading Nikador into action.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Proud of their unmatched strength and divine weapons, Nikador listened with scorn. Gripping their spear in one hand and shield in the other, they summoned all their might and clashed them together.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' A thunderous roar split the heavens. The earth trembled as if struck by divine wrath, quaking for what felt like an eternity before settling into silence. As the dust cleared, the spear remained unscathed, but the shield had shattered into countless fragments.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Some say these fragments were later minted into coins by Zagreus. Others whisper that they became the secret behind the indomitable shields of Castrum Kremnos.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Lance of Fury is really something.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus is such an opportunist.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, the giant had finally stripped its foe of one deadly weapon &mdash; But that was all.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Their struggle would not end here. It would carry on, stretching into the days yet to come.

:'''Divergent Universe:''' Oronyx sang a prophecy about gold, a prophecy that gilded the newborn world with prosperity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In that pastoral Era Chrysea, Oronyx was the most overlooked of the gods. Their words were barely heard, and their altar was devoid of offerings and followers, only accumulating dust.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Because all of humanity's needs were met, there was no hunger, cold, or pain, and every day in the future would be as happy as today. Who would need prophecies then?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In that era, the only thing humanity needed from Oronyx might have been to gaze at the stars under the night sky. And Oronyx was not angry about this, still lonely, continuing to prophesize.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} At that time, the world had no changes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humanity's good days wouldn't last long.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oronyx's value would finally reveal itself.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Conflicts, accompanied by the sound of war drums, surged forward, followed closely by various schemes. All certainties were shattered. Those alive today could be dead tomorrow, regardless of whether you are a commoner or a king.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Before the temple of Oronyx, the ground was filled with worshipers seeking guidance, and one after another, prophetic altars rose up, their number even surpassing that of the public baths at one point.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In the darkest moments, the vulnerability of humanity was laid bare, but Oronyx did not abandon these opportunistic people. Instead, Oronyx patiently guided them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They allowed generals to grasp the routes of rebel attacks, and they enabled doctors to know the outbreak time of plagues. Under the protection of prophecy, people reignited their fighting spirit and struggled to keep life moving forward.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The granularity of this prophecy is quite detailed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oronyx is a good Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't humans be more proactive?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Some deceive others under the banner of the Evernight Veil, the first of it being Zagreus. They once disguised themselves as Oronyx, declaring that a great flood was about to engulf Icaria, causing the entire city to flee overnight.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Similar tricks were played time and again, but most people still willingly fell for them, showing just how devout they were toward Oronyx back then.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' That is, until Oronyx could no longer bear it and only shared the prophecies with the senior priests, for only they could discern Oronyx's true form.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The earliest anti-fraud measure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus likes to interfere in everything.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From that point on, most people could no longer communicate directly with Oronyx. The priests monopolized the right to converse with the divine, but fortunately, they remained dutiful enough to carry out Oronyx's imposed obligations year after year.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But if every path requires a god's light to illuminate it, how far can humanity truly advance? Should the day come when they abandon us... where would we turn then?

===Platinum Prophecy===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Oronyx proclaimed a prophecy concerning platinum, this revelation brought a turning point to the turbulent world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The first was the destruction of Pompeia, a prosperous city that stood on the western side of the continent. The buildings were built from sturdy granite stones, but they fell into the abyss in an instant.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It's said the people of the city defiled the land, provoking the wrath of Georios. The gentle Titan, in a rare fury, tore open their own chest and swallowed the entire city, every soul within.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The earthquake's devastation was so absolute that Pompeia left no relics behind. Only a few devout followers of Oronyx, who heeded the prophecy and fled beforehand, allowed later generations to learn the details of the catastrophe.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even Georios's got some temper.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Titans' might are so overwhelming.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oronyx helped humanity again.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet some doubt this prophecy. After all, only a handful of believers received the divine revelation, leaving room for deception. But the next prophecy was undeniable, known to all in Amphoreus without exception.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' At that time, Castrum Kremnos prepared to annex its neighboring smaller city. Oronyx delivered a divine decree, foretelling the campaign's failure, and declaring the general of Kremnos would meet his end at Clearspring Gorge's narrow pass, doomed to fall from his steed to the cliffs below.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The small city's morale soared, and they ultimately used the narrow terrain to achieve a victory against the overwhelming number of invaders, thwarting Kremnos's invasion. And just as the prophecy foretold, Kremnos's general met his destined end.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This war forced even those who once doubted Oronyx to believe, for no one could halt Nikador's conquests, yet not even this God of War could defy Oronyx's prophecy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even Nikador was humbled.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How I wish Oronyx would divine a fortune for me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's some beefed-up prophecy.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Of all Oronyx's prophecies, only one remains unfulfilled, and that is the foretelling of Amphoreus' ultimate fate.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet the prophecy's exact contents remain fiercely guarded by the priests, spawning countless conspiracy theories. Some claim the Chrysos Heir will bring eternal peace, while others insist the black tide will ultimately devour all.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Though the priests deny every rumor, insisting Oronyx never delivered a definitive verdict, whispers continue to multiply, carried by the wind like scattering leaves.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Conspiracy theories are always the most popular.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm curious about the prophecy, too.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Whether the priests deliberately conceal it or not, their approach may be wise. For mortals, knowing the world's truth too soon is never a blessing.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' After all, even if tomorrow brought the world's end, we could change nothing, it would only multiply our despair. So living for today remains the wisest answer.

===Lead and Steel Prophecy===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Oronyx murmured a prophecy of lead and steel, this revelation deepened the confusion of a fallen world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Now that Oronyx has turned wordless and deafened, hearing no prayers, speaking no revelations. No matter how fervently the priests plead, they keep silent. Only the echoes of human voices remain in the hollow temple halls.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The signs of Oronyx's withdrawal were there from the beginning. At first, their prophecies grew increasingly vague, reduced to cryptic fragments that even the seasoned priests struggled to decipher.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Later, the intervals between prophecies stretched longer. Years of desperate waiting might yield only a handful of broken phrases.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oronyx became a Riddler.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Something must have happened.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Priests and scholars argue endlessly regarding Oronyx's silence. One hypothesis claims Oronyx exhausted their divine power by delivering too many prophecies in the past, and that once restored, their voice will return.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Another conjecture is that the priests deliberately severed the communication between Oronyx and mortals, with the intention of consolidating power in their own hands.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' No matter how many absurd hypotheses arose, Oronyx responded with silence. In this way, mortals were truly pitiful. Without the guidance of the Titans, they could not unify their opinions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humans need Titans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humans are simply accustomed to relying on the Titans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Make a sound, any sound, Oronyx.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' When the last priest who communicated directly with Oronyx passed away, those great prophecies became distant legends, passed down from generation to generation in Amphoreus.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Future generations could only glimpse the power of this Titan from the remaining divine miracles and obtain a small, pitiful revelation from dreamlike whispers.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Don't worry about the truth of the revelation. As long as they allow the helpless to sleep peacefully in the night, it is enough to be of help.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It mainly serves as psychological comfort.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's always good to have help.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Look up at the deep night, the dim stars offer no guidance, and all that responds to us is the silent darkness, as if this Titan no longer exists in the world.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Only those chosen by the prophecy can hear whimpers of sound from the ancient west wind that has blown for millennia.

===Law That Binds All Things===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Who was the one that enacted the laws that bound all things at the inception of primordial chaos, and set order upon existence?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In that repression that could even choke Titans, space and time intertwined like fibers, with the newborn Amphoreus on the cusp of peril.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Talanton, the calm and steady one, manifested as a scale that traversed the chaos. They called their sisters to embrace both sides of the scale holding up time and space, and thus was the first law of the world proclaimed: that space and time be forever separate.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' From then on, space became a mountain &mdash; unmovable, allowing all things to reside within. Time became a river &mdash; tumbling forward, granting all things capable of change.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What principles are at work here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A glorious achievement indeed.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The work of world-forging was far from complete, and Talanton works endlessly to formulate new laws.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' That which is heavy presses down, and what is light ascends. That which is hard offers firmness, while that which is soft remains brittle. The hot shines while the cold dims... This way, countless laws were placed on both sides of the scale, to face harsh judgment before the Scale of Justice.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is with the support of these laws that the land, the sea, and the sky came to be.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even an insignificant grain of soil, a fleeting, tumbling wave, or an ephemeral gust of air bears Talanton's delicate balance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The very model of what a Titan should be.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's hard to imagine a world without rules.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But rules... are made to be broken.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In the order and laws above all things, there is one essential maxim: All matters have a beginning as well as an end.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Talanton knows that all things are born of destiny, and are destined to return thusly as well. Hence, trees wither, rivers dry, and wailing gales will scatter. Even the primate of all intelligent beings, we humans loved by the gods, will depart for the netherworld after our death.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But do not blame Talanton for their coldness. Go see the broken spine of the land, for that is the price to pay for the endless propagation of life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then do Titans have an end?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Balance sets the cycle of life in motion.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' May Talanton's scale be forever righteous, lest light and dark, lightness and heaviness, quickness and slowness, and even time and space themselves return to chaos.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' May all things follow their ordained laws, and never defy the Scale of Justice, lest they face the severest judgment.

===Law That Binds Human Morals===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Who, at the dawn of wisdom's awakening, decreed the morals that bind our deeds, letting ethics illuminate human hearts?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Humanity's opinion of Talanton is complicated. They aren't universally beloved like the beautiful Mnestia or wise Cerces, but they also aren't disdained like treacherous Zagreus.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Because fairness is but a neutral term, and it goes against the instincts of a person far too often.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In the narrow morality that rules humanity, fairness means to give and receive in turn, getting rewarded for doing good, being punished for doing wrong.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But to Talanton, the only means of judging fairness is by weighing both sides of the scales and see which rises and which falls.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The mind of a Titan is beyond human comprehension.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This seems a bit sloppy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can do this job too.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Since the first conflict among humankind, countless civilized city-states have fallen to barbarian hordes, and noble heroes met their end by schemers' hands, yet none of this could tip the scales of cosmic justice.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' For in Talanton's eyes, these were but mortal games. Yet should humanity cross the line, their judgment would strike like thunder.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Take the tale of the kingslayer, the guard captain who assassinated a tyrant king on a moonless night, only to drop dead himself when the deed was done.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' For he betrayed his oath of loyalty to protect his lord. Even should a flower of righteousness bloom for him, he must still taste the fruit of atonement.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't understand this kind of impartiality.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I understand this kind of impartiality.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This merciless verdict sparked outrage. Crowds flooded Talanton's temples, shouting demands for the kingslayer's vindication.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Would Talanton heed them? To this implacable Titan, the kingslayer was merely a weight that disturbed the scales &mdash; and the protesters' cries could never ripple the balance.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Perhaps these very protests were themselves but another counterweight on the scales of balance?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} All is within Talanton's considerations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are like an intricate machine.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' How could the lowly intellect of a human ever grasp what Talanton is thinking? One must believe in the judgment of the Scale of Justice, for it never leans toward any side.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' May humanity remember divine retribution, restrain their inner desires and defiance, and willingly walk the straight path of morality and law.

===Law That Binds Divine Gods===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Who, as the scales began to tilt, invoked the spells that bound the Titans, restoring balance to the earth?
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Zagreus once pleased every Titan &mdash; except Talanton, who feared even their laughter might tremble the scales.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The mischievous Zagreus hatched a plan. In the darkest hour before dawn, they stole the scales, toying with them as they flew west &mdash; all because they loathed Talanton's perpetual sternness.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' That day, all who looked up saw a colossal shooting star. Where it passed, giant trees floated midair, rivers flooded fields, and theft ran rampant through cities.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The balance is broken.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The rules have been broken.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zagreus's is in big trouble this time.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Talanton's wrath alarmed even the gods &mdash; Phagousa themself stifled their laughter, and the sea lay still as polished glass.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The gods united to reclaim the scales. Georios raised mountains with outstretched arms to block Zagreus' path, while Aquila unveiled a hundred eyes to illuminate the earth, leaving Zagreus nowhere to hide.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Even Nikador finally drew their spear, pressing it to Zagreus' throat until the scales were surrendered.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Yet Talanton would never spare such a rogue &mdash; and so a new law was forged: Every thief would, in the end, lose all they had stolen.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a pretty harsh curse.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} From winning everything to having nothing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even Nikador is on the move.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' O Zagreus, pitiable, yet detestable. They can only ceaselessly steal and constantly lose. Such is an endless cycle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And the ones that believe in them in mortal realms are also afflicted by this curse, coursing through them like a snake's poison. There is no more hope of absolution for their like.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Every thief is cursing Talanton, cursing that scale.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's pretty rough being a thief.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's all Zagreus's fault.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thank Talanton. They forged an unbreakable shackle for the Trickery Titan, and terrified every deceitful thief.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But did they know, from this, countless enemies would arise? That their scales would become every thief's coveted prize?

===Most Weighty Thing===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is the most weighty thing in Amphoreus, carrying the growth of all things on its massive body.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' In the distant past of the primordial ages, for countless years, the formless and abstract fate moved alone, but in that ethereal and abstract world, no tangible things could be born.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Thus, Janus created a mass of material that should not have existed in the void, Talanton molded it into a concrete shape, and Oronyx gave it the ability to self-evolve.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' And so, Georios was born. The Three Fates placed it as the initial counterweight on one side of the balance, and finally, Amphoreus had stable matter.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So that's how the land came to be.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is the right use for a heavy weight.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Originally, Georios wasn't as steady as they are now. Like all newborns, they were filled with curiosity about this world, and every time they explored beyond, tremendous earthquakes would plague the land.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' What the Three Fates sisters needed was a stable land, and so Talanton patiently instructed Georios to bury their impulses deep beneath the thickness of the crust.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Georios followed Talanton's teachings diligently, slowly becoming steady and reserved. In the silence of the passing years, they grew thick layers of soil and towering mountains.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Now, from a high vantage point, only the deep, unfathomable ravines remain, recording the mischievousness of Georios in their youth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Heh, they were pretty naughty as a kid.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton's teachings are true and righteous.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Bored and restless, Georios chose to fall into a deep sleep. The cold part of the air they exhaled condensed into dew as it rose. The dew fell back to the earth, eventually gathering in the sunken areas to form the great sea, which became Phagousa.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' The hot part of it rose to the top of the sky, and due to the obstruction of Veil of Evernight, the gas condensed into a giant bird with wings large enough to cover the earth &mdash; Aquila was also born.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But Georios did not like their blood relatives. They constantly complained about the waves eroding the land and the hurricanes destroying the forests. However, the kind-hearted Georios did not resort to violence, but instead quietly grew new lands and forests.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It might be a myth, but that's pretty romantic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, Georios has some patience.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Why is it that the range of human activity is mostly confined to the land? Even those who occasionally cross the oceans often meet their end at the bottom of the sea, not to mention the unreachable heights of the sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It is because the sky is arrogant, the ocean is frolicsome, but only the earth is generous in nature, willing to accommodate the weakness and stupidity of man.

===Most Stubborn Thing===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They are Amphoreus's most obstinate creation, wielding endless patience to intricately sculpt the world in all its facets.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Georios is the original craftsman. Every manner of strange rock, Mountain Dweller, and dromas are works of their creation. Yet, they cannot be considered the best crafter, for their works lack any semblance of finesse.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' All the divines mocked Georios's creations for amusement, and even Zagreus was too slothful to steal from them.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Mnestia kindly offered to teach them the delicate lines and vibrant colors, but Georios waved it off with their big hand, claiming they had no interest.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Phagousa loved to tease the earnest Georios. Sometimes, before the clay sculptures were fully hardened, a sudden downpour would smash down without warning, turning Georios's hard work into a puddle of mud.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Crude, but effective.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Georios is going to blow a gasket this time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Phagousa did go a little too far here.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' It was rare for Georios to lose their temper. They piled the lump of mud at the river mouth in protest, but unexpectedly, it brought fertile land to the people.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This small dispute had another consequence: Whenever heavy rain came, the land animals would give up hunting and resting, scattering in all directions in search of shelter from the rain.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Perhaps, even till the very present, they remain fearful of being turned to mud and mire by Phagousa.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Once bitten, twice shy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May we sleep soundly on every rain-sodden night.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila saw the land filled with vitality, and noticed their own kingdom of sky was empty and cold, and thus decided to learn from Georios and forge creations of their own.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But the sky was devoid of mud, and Aquila was hollow of patience, so they could only knead balls of air to create irregular clouds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Aquila quickly lost interest in these creations and allowed them to float as they will in the sky.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But Georios found themself interested in these clouds, and sometimes shakes hands with them. Thus, we see a mingling of mountains and clouds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aquila didn't understand the essence of things.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Georios actually does know how to appreciate beauty.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' I wandered the world and saw countless sights. The vast plains were Georios's chest, and the majestic mountains were their arms.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' May our Pillar of Stone know eternal slumber, and may the soil beneath our feet remain ever firm.

===Most Gentle Thing===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They were the most gentle being of Amphoreus, using priceless revelations to save fallen humanity.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' After the Era Chrysea ended, many city-states fell into darkness. People could no longer enjoy endless supplies of food and were forced to revert to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' However, the excessive population had already filled every corner of the land. The exploitative way of taking from nature had overwhelmed the ecosystem, and countless people fought each other out of hunger. Terrifying tragedies occurred every day.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Enraged by humanity's greed, Cerces commanded all plants to wilt. Just as mortals believed the Titans had forsaken them, Georios once again revealed their boundless compassion.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That was a dark age.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} People have to pay for their actions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Georios, seriously... I'm literally in tears.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Georios pleaded with Cerces and struck a covenant: Spring would return to the land if humans overcame their avarice.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' So Georios sought their own Kin, a mole. It stole the last apple from the people's sack, and the hungry masses chased this mole to a valley.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' They saw a golden wheat field where the moles would burrow into the soil, making the ground soft and suitable for farming.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' This was a trial set by the two Titans for humanity. If they collected the seeds and grew their own food through farming, Cerces would forgive their past transgressions.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' On the contrary, if they devoured all the food in the wheat field, humanity would face extinction, even though they were Kephale's creation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a harsh and brutal test.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, humanity's still here, so the outcome can't be that bad.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Georios's priests mimicked the moles, tilling the soil to bury the first handful of wheat seeds.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Under Cerces's blessing, dense ears of wheat sprouted forth from the soil, and spring returned to Amphoreus.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Humans learned to reap sustenance through toil. Where the first seeds were sown, they raised Georios's sanctuary, offering the inaugural wheat harvested during the Month of Reaping to the merciful Titan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's no glory like work.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You give and you get.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are truly merciful.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' Now, Georios has sunken into eternal slumber. They can no longer see the land and people they once saved.
:'''Divergent Universe:''' But those patches of golden wheat fields, and those tight bundles of harvest, and smiling, satisfied faces are the best means of comfort for this Titan.
