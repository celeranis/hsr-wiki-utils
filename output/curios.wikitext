If the Aeons truly stand above all lifeforms and rule supreme, then why would they care about the everyday concerns of mortals? The existence of the sleeping and shapeless IX is proof of that. To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time &mdash; There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax.

:Rather than verbose doctrines, Bounty Hunters believe that practice is the best teacher. When guiding a newcomer, the seasoned hunter, Kayer, threw him into the northern forests of planet Reidmann. The youth, using traps, killed a hidden-winged terror bird, pulled out its bones, and reappeared many days later before the drillmaster after honing the bones into a sword. When Kayer caught a second hidden-winged terror bird and ordered him to kill it, the once fearsome beast had become a fledgling on the chopping board. Years later, whenever he spoke privately about the experiences in the forest, the youth would weep bitterly and curse the humanoid monster, Kayer.

:In certain brink quadrants that were forced into development, a number of the natives that were responsible for the cheap labor would mistakenly believe that the credit currency used by the IPC was the fruit of a certain plant. So, they would retain the freshest-looking notes and bury them in the ground, with the hopes of growing their very own credit trees. The meddlesome Masked Fools gained inspiration from this misunderstanding and imitated the concept of the Gold Coins of Discord to create a credit tree, spreading the seeds far and wide. Fearing inevitable inflation, the IPC immediately set blockades across large borderland areas and rushed to the fruit fields to investigate. What they found on arrival, however, was that the locals had taken to simply eating the credits as fruits instead.

:When the rock king Akbar was giving a disaster relief performance in the Merlo Nebula, he was struck with sudden inspiration by a strange fruit. These strange-looking fruits had been given the absurd name "pineapple," so he wrote about his extraordinary experience in his song lyrics and called upon his fans to attack the archaic language of the old world. Under his leadership, the rebellious youths began to endlessly twist existing nouns and filled the cold warehouses of every interstellar courier company with unimaginable "pineapples." It was only when over 100 developed worlds changed the definition of the word "pineapple" due to the fans that this wild, fruit-inspired rock and roll movement finally stopped in its tracks.

:Nine Amber Eras ago, an infamous thief was arrested in the Alda planetary system. Before he was arrested, he had vowed that he would steal the thing that the people of Alda hold most precious in their lives. What no one could comprehend was that although the thief never stated what exactly their target was, they repeatedly asserted during trial that they were already successful with the announced burglary. Unaware of what had been stolen from them, the people of Alda became extremely panicked about what it was that they had lost, and the whole planetary system fell into deep mourning. Though it seemed like they had not actually lost anything, they could not help but worry what was most precious to them had been stolen.

:After the astounding success of the Interastral Big Lotto, the Business Consolidation Department struck while the iron was hot and issued the classic Quantum Big Lotto, riding on the hype of the big lotto's extrapolations and predictions. To solve this eternal question in probability and to obtain information about fortune in pure randomness, the number of students enrolling in the Quantum History School had once exceeded the peak level before their reformation. Though there would often be scholars who claim they've successfully made a model of the Quantum Big Lotto's trend, they would unanimously change their tone the day before their thesis is published &mdash; That their so-called discovery is just a misunderstanding.

Any tiny change would instantly disintegrate the fragile balance. No matter how much the scholars continue to perfect the model, they could only consider the foolish act of unifying the pattern of movement as the hubris of mortals. Therefore, I still clearly remember the first day I killed the butterfly, even though it was so long ago. I remember how the point of the knife stabbed into its chest.

:Scholars from the School of Relative Cognition point out that the Synesthesia Beacon's appearance significantly hurt the scope of thought in the universe. The user can only think from their perspective for all eternity, and can never truly understand the other party's intention. There are even those who claim that the IPC already has a tight grasp on the beacon's master permissions and that all you and everyone else hear are words that have already been altered. Therefore, they manually created interference events and tried their best to destroy the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, with the sole aim of letting many languages on the brinks of death return to the Cosmos &mdash; "The Synesthesia School says that the Synesthesia Beacon is The Riddlers' natural enemies, but The Riddlers claim that Synesthesia Beacons are doing an even better job at riddling."
