Some among them might even have names with special implications, connected to stories known only to a few &mdash; stories such as the Thalan Toxi-Flame, which exists on record as one of the 774 most toxic cocktails. Records show that in the Aterlexian System, the Thalan Toxi-Flame was once extremely popular among the locals, with each of the locals that sampled its taste no longer able to describe the flavors thereafter. The Pepeshi people, imbued with acute olfactory senses, would use their understanding of the beverage to their benefit and introduced other counterfeit drinks such as the Thalan Mysti-Flame, the Thalan Hydro-Flame, and the Thalan Detoxi-Flame to the cosmos, with each of them being entirely harmless and alcohol-free.

:The Doctors of Chaos can't see the point when it comes to meaningless demonstrations of rebelliousness. They once placed the fang of an Inquisition Spirit, Baviru mucus, and the blood of a wandering devil within a Tonic of Efficacious Chaos before touching it to the head of a telepathic spider to seal the tonic's opening. The Doctors of Chaos believe that this tonic can work wonders when treating a patient's loneliness, but it also makes them grow increasingly hostile toward the doctors at the end of the process. Its side effects can commonly cause Self-Annihilators to behold the "Shadow of Nihility."

The helper robot and the master worked at full speed, but their digestion still could not keep up with how fast the cheese was multiplying. Therefore, they had to ask for help from a group of passing Mourning Actors and escaped to another world on a gondola. That one world in the cosmos is still stuffed full of delicious cheese to the day, packed so tight that not a single centimeter of space is left. The story teaches an important lesson about not wasting food.

:The Riddlers have a saying: every time that an enigma manifests in the universe, it will leave behind a "staircase" in the void. The dissolved realities will then drip down the steps, condensing into a mottled thing bearing semblance to a jellyfish. There was once a Nameless who claimed to have made contact with a "Jellyfish on the Staircase." In madness, he proclaimed that the jellyfish will activate the cognition regions within the gray matter of one's brain &mdash; a vast place beyond the fathoming of mortal minds.

:What is truth? No one truly knows. Supposing that "stupidity" is an incurable disease in this world, then disseminating knowledge counts as a treatment for the universe. But can "books" mend all living things? According to the Intelligentsia Guild's historical records, the Philosopher Union of the Laurel Wreath Galaxy once erupted in civil war, and blood and machine oil had stained all the books in the contemplators' corridors. Uncountable numbers of scholars died, and the IPC employees who witnessed it all deemed this occurrence "Rationality's Fall" &mdash; Through such absurd means, books cleansed a world of its impurities once more.

:A box that can predict the thoughts of the one who opens it. When the box's hatch is lifted, the item within will manifest into what your mind envisions. Herta once rated it as one of the hardest Curios to deal with. She had butted heads with the Indecipherable Box numerous times, but never was she able to control the thoughts in her mind when she opened it. Finally, she cast it down and never touched it again. Perhaps Herta is capable of almost anything - except completely emptying her mind.

:The Elixir Seekers once found a rotten Fruit of the Alien Tree. The color of its skin was already odd, having shifted from a faint yellow to powdery blue. To understand the pharmacology behind this fruit, a pair of Elixir Seeker twins separately ingested a normal Fruit of the Alien Tree and a rotten version. One of them immediately welcomed metamorphosis while the other instantly perished - But because there was no third party present, no one could confirm which twin survived, or which fruit he consumed.

:In the Black Forest, a sponge miraculously became sapient. It tried to interact with the similarly sapient screws, but found itself hitting a brick wall. It pondered about its painful experience and learned to smooth away all the edges in its personality, allowing itself to constantly shine and climb up the societal ladder, ultimately turning into a smooth and slick sponge. Now, it dedicates its efforts to uplifting discarded sponges into developing their own self-awareness.

:To combat the determinacy of Erudition, the Riddlers performed a great deal of labor in aspects of knowledge that has yet to be set in stone. They inserted the Fog of Thought and the Rain of Sensation into a single prismatic lens, and their combined colors shifted endlessly to form a "magnetic field" that can disturb the senses. Revelrous in their success, the Riddlers sought to push this line of research onward but were made to stop, for the more they committed to this study, the more they grew uncertain of the necessity of its continuation.

Undoubtably, only an organic lifeform could have proven its innocence.

:There is a saying amongst the dejected Self-Annihilators that the universe has no purpose and humans are nothing in the eyes of the Aeons. If the Aeons truly stand above all lifeforms and rule supreme, then why would they care about the everyday concerns of mortals? The existence of the sleeping and shapeless IX is proof of that. To show the Self-Annihilators that the Aeons do care, the Doctors of Chaos combined the demon god crafts of the occult monks to create the Sealing Wax of Aeons. It is said that stamping with this Sealing Wax will attract a glimpse from the corresponding Aeon from across space and time &mdash; There are no successful examples yet, but some Self-Annihilators did regain their faith in the universe, Aeons, and everything else after stamping with this sealing wax.

Following the machine era calendar, on this day at three in the afternoon, the invasive "Cognito Invalidater" entered the mind of a certain organic individual in the Mechanical City. At the start, he was helpless against the uncontrolled thoughts in his own mind. Then, he realized writing notes could help him effectively counter the anxiety and meaninglessness the "Cognito Invalidater" inflicted on him. So he began to write, spewing forth words, expelling the chaotic and incoherent noises in his head that remained deafening loud despite being bereft of substance. He produced lines and lines of error code. This eventually drew the Riddlers' attention.

But he did not despair, for soon he learned to master this new and unique skill, concealing his flurry of emotions from the inorganic masses, becoming the most average of all machines, and embarking on the Path of Equilibrium.

Only paltry few unmodified animals remained in the city. Hence, fueled by the "Revelrous" contagion, the mono-horned beast was able to overcome all manner of despairing defeats, awkward incidents, and crippling moments of dread. Sadness became joy for it, pain became pleasure, and pressure became a trigger for secreting excitatory neurotransmitters &mdash; Until one day it realized it had taught itself how to convert "mood" into a freely adjustable parameter. Thereafter, its confidence was perpetually high and unshakable, turning it into a "Rainbow-Radiant Unicorn."

It claimed to have met the emperor, only to break away from the "Wildminder" in its head &mdash; The thought slammed the limits of its brain, overloading its thoughts to the point of exhaustion. But after Rubert fixed a single line of unmarkable code, it awakened from this haze, coming to realize that none of this had happened, that it had only been another illusion.
