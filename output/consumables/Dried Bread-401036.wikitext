|description = The wheat of Aedes Elysiae once enjoyed great fame across the land. Bread made from it was sweet, soft, and incredibly delicious. Now that the village has been destroyed by the black tide, the few loaves that remain have long since dried out and hardened, serving only as mementos rather than food.
