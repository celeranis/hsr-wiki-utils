|description = It is said that in the ancient coastal region of Styxia, fishermen would play a bone flute to attract schools of fish. Sometimes, sea sirens lurking among the reefs would also be drawn to the music, rising from the water to sing in duet with the fishermen. At times, the fishermen would gift the bone flute to the sea sirens, who in turn would offer their scales in return.
