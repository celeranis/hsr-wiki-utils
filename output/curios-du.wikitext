:Doctor Atarte invented a nutrition management machine to confront the increasingly dire challenge of obesity. Not only can this machine absorb excess nutrition from its owner and save these calories elsewhere, but it can also filter out the harmless particles in the atmosphere to synthesize food. However, no one expected the consumers would instead gain weight, as the synthesized foods were too efficient and caused the users to keep eating. The overwhelming complaints made Doctor Atarte lose sleep for days at a time, losing a large amount of weight.

These bizarre ointments start from the patient's cognition and erase the root of the emotion that may give birth to Nihility.

:A group of Kephale followers were obsessed with finding giant footprints. They claimed those are the proofs of Kephale once walking on earth, and people would receive the Titan's blessing if they stood in the footprints. Another group smelled a business opportunity from this rumor. They were dedicated to finding new footprints, then building exhibition halls around the prints and charging a fee for pilgrims coming to worship. These activities drew a third kind of people, the craftsmen and businesses that sold miniature models of the footprint around the halls. Maybe boosting commerce is also a form of Kephale's blessing.

With varying levels of stimulation, pheromone sensors that ignore distance would cause the insect to change color in real time and allow for simple information exchange. With this secret code, the bounty hunters became more and more courageous on the battlefield, until they came face-to-face with the Afterglow Swarm King attracted by the pheromones.

As such, any visitors that enter Viropa will be met with the corresponding visual impairment, which is restored as soon as they leave the star system. The academic world has been chronically dumbfounded about whether a pathstrider of the Enigmata is capable of affecting change on such a scale. Since the loss of colors has never caused any disruptions to the physical laws of this system, there are some who speculate that this unrest is nothing more than the stark lies of History Fictionologists. To this day, there are still unending droves of academics who travel to Viropa to investigate this phenomenon, engaged in fevered debate over questions that have no answers.

:There are always those in the vast Cosmos who ignored the Omen Vanguards' warning, such as the owner of the Eton Toy Factory. When the pathwalkers of Finality warned him that he should destroy an entire batch of newly manufactured toys, he only responded with thundering rage. After 24 system hours, the Talot race hiding within the toys launched their attack against the toy factory. This liquid-state cluster entity, which comes from the border star zones, shared their consciousness communally and eagerly invited other living beings to join them &mdash; Eton soon became one of them.

Under his leadership, the rebellious youths began to endlessly twist existing nouns and filled the cold warehouses of every interstellar courier company with unimaginable "pineapples."

She used injections of drugs to alter her external physical form, aiming for that of a human. Her breathing holes were covered with skin and her organs and bones were forcibly stretched, but this endless pain allowed her to gain the appearance of a human. However, this new look of hers was unfortunately met with disdain and contempt. With Slejka's encouragement, an endless queue of sentient beings came forth to change their appearance so they could look more human. However, this was not because transforming into a human held any particular benefit to her. It was purely because she wanted more people to share this pain with her.
