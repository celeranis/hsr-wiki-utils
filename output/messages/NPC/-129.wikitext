:{{DIcon|Warning}} Black Swan has sent you a message request.
:'''Black Swan:''' (Trailblazer), I imagine you have already seen that dream bubble?
:'''Black Swan:''' Relax, I just want to know if anyone has come looking for you yet
:{Choice} Black Swan?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're Black Swan?
::'''Black Swan:''' Indeed, the Memokeeper you know.
::'''Black Swan:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 13.png|80px]]
:{Choice} What's up?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's up?
:'''Black Swan:''' I'll make this simple: That Fool named "Sparkle" is currently searching all over the place for that dream bubble
:'''Black Swan:''' I do not know what her intentions are, but allowing it to slip into her hands will only make this situation more confusing
:'''Black Swan:''' (Trailblazer), can you do me a favor and go to reclaim that dream bubble?
:{Choice} Of course!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Of course!
::'''Black Swan:''' Your attitude is reassuring, I will go with you
:{Choice} Why don't you do it yourself?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why don't you do it yourself?
::'''Black Swan:''' I didn't expect you to refuse me... I guess I could go myself
:'''Black Swan:''' But I don't remember where that dream bubble was left
:'''Black Swan:''' Can you remind me?
:{Choice} In the Dreamscape Sales Store
::'''(Trailblazer):''' In the Dreamscape Sales Store, Dr. Edward has it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You don't remember?
::'''Black Swan:''' Heehee~
::'''Black Swan:''' Well, my memory is nothing compared to a true Memokeeper
::'''Black Swan:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 12.png|80px]]
::'''Black Swan:''' Ah, I can't believe I got the intel so easily. I was really worried I was going to be exposed!
:{Choice} I stole it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I stole it, stuffed it in a SoulGlad bottle, and threw it away
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's probably still floating around in some trashcan's dream
::'''Black Swan:''' Do you really love trashcans that much?
::'''Black Swan:''' I told you, Trashcan Kingdom was super fun! No one ever believes me
::'''Black Swan:''' Looks like disguising myself as Sampo was actually worth it
::'''Black Swan:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 12.png|80px]]
:{Choice} How could a Memokeeper forget a memory?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm curious... How could a Memokeeper forget a memory?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Are you really Black Swan?
::'''Black Swan:''' Hm? You've figured me out?
::'''Black Swan:''' Well, I'm not a true Memokeeper, after all
::'''Black Swan:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 12.png|80px]]
::'''Black Swan:''' I can't believe you figured me out so quickly, how dull
:'''Black Swan:''' Pranks are all about the back-and-forth! You've seen how much fun I have with that Memokeeper...
:'''Black Swan:''' You should learn from her, young Nameless
:'''Black Swan:''' This is just the beginning, I'll be back!
:'''Black Swan:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 05 Wubbaboo 13.png|80px]]
:{Choice} Bring it on
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Bring it on, we'll see who tricks whom next time!
:{Choice} Please don't come back
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Please don't come back! Nothing good ever comes from hanging about with a Fool...

::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think I've seen this on TV before... Based on the plot, might you be the president of the Music Club?
::'''???:''' ?
::'''???:''' What's that?
:'''???:''' The airship's scenery is great, but just a shame that only the strong are worthy of treading upon the deck

:{Choice} ?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, I had insurance? What's the payout amount?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait a minute. Sent flying? So that doll wasn't your setup? This doesn't match what the Organizer said.
:{Choice} Why are you sending me a donation link?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' About time this race got something right.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, why is this asking for a transfer?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This looks fishy. Are you trying to scam me?

:'''Pom-Pom:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px]]
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Pom-Pom broke the comms device during Pom-Pom's routine inspection, so Pom-Pom had to change to a temporary account of Pom-Pom's!!!
:{Choice} I suspect you are Sparkle
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I still suspect that you are Sparkle
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Because...
::{Choice} You're spamming too many Pom-Poms!!!
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're spamming way too many Pom-Poms than the normal level!

:'''Pom-Pom:''' Awww...
:'''Pom-Pom:''' You're really starting to sound like a broken record with that term
:'''Pom-Pom:''' How can you call having fun "making trouble"?
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Have you never heard the phrase: "A bit of fun a day keeps the Masked Fool away?"
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Masked Fools prefer to stir up things in life that are inherently boring, making them more wonderful!
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Alright, I've got things to do. If you don't want me back, I won't come back
