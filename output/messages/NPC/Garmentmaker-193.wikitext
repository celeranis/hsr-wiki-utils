:'''Garmentmaker:''' Regarding the Creation Nymph, I need to explain something to you, my distinguished guest.
:'''Garmentmaker:''' That ornate-clad dromas visited Lady Aglaea recently, and gave instructions before leaving.
:{Choice} Typical of him.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' He still loves giving unsolicited advice.
:{Choice} What did he say?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What profound insight now?
:'''Garmentmaker:''' Admittedly, his words held merit.
:'''Garmentmaker:''' "Hmph, your minds are too clouded to see the answer before your eyes."
:{Choice} His preambles remain endless.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No need to repeat that part.
:{Choice} Already drowsy after one sentence.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Let's get to the point.
:'''Garmentmaker:''' "Simply channel the Time Titan's power into the golden threads, bind the nymph's limbs, and it can be recalled back anywhere, anytime."
:'''Garmentmaker:''' I tested this with the nymph you touched before &mdash; it works.
:'''Garmentmaker:''' From now on, once you've touched the same nymph, you won't lose track of it again.
:'''Garmentmaker:''' You can recall them through me. Come here when needed.
