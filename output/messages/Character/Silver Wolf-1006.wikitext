:'''Silver Wolf:''' No way you topped my leaderboard score!
:'''Silver Wolf:''' You're definitely cheating.
:{Choice} You're the real cheater here...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've got some nerve! Your score is obviously fake. You lost to me and still had the guts to put it on the leaderboard.
:{Choice} I honestly didn't cheat!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I, (Trailblazer), swear to the sky I haven't cheated! If I did, I'd throw myself off Dreamflux Reef right now!
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Nice driving skills you've got there. Wanna come over and give Bladie some lessons?
:{Choice} But I thought Bladie had a driver's license?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But I thought Bladie had a driver's license?
::'''Silver Wolf:''' I'm not convinced he got that license legally.
::'''Silver Wolf:''' I'm not slandering him. One ride in his car and you'll totally get it.
:{Choice} Your driving's not bad, either.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You're a pretty good driver yourself. Why don't you teach him?
::'''Silver Wolf:''' I was actually trying to be nice and teach him.
::'''Silver Wolf:''' But he was too stubborn and claimed he already knows how.
::'''Silver Wolf:''' I couldn't get through to him, and didn't feel like wasting my breath.
::'''Silver Wolf:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 02 Silver Wolf 01.png|80px]]
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Simulated Spheroid Racing: 26 dropped an update. Gotta go play it!
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Enjoy my "gift" and hit me up if you want to play together sometime.
