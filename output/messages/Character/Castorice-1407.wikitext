:'''Castorice:''' Miss (Trailblazer), if you are receiving this message, then you must have already departed the nether realm
:'''Castorice:''' I now feel that our farewell was far too rushed
:'''Castorice:''' It was only after you left that I remembered I still had something to tell you
:'''Castorice:''' I crocheted a little doll of you, (Trailblazer), but I didn't manage to finish stuffing it with milk cotton before I left
:'''Castorice:''' I also tried to recreate the Express as a cloth pendant based on your description
:'''Castorice:''' I tucked it inside a photo album. When decorated with dried flowers, it looked truly one of a kind
:'''Castorice:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 22 Castorice 01.png|80px]]
:'''Castorice:''' I had hoped that... when you reach the end of the Flame-Chase and stand witness to the birth of a new world, these items might bring you a trace of warmth
:'''Castorice:''' But in the end, I didn't even manage to give them to you in time
:'''Castorice:''' To ensure the new world's warmth, I will forever remain within this sea of flowers to watch over lost souls.
:'''Castorice:''' And if fate allows us to meet again, remember our promise
:{Choice} Deal
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Deal
:{Choice} When will we meet again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' When will we meet again?
