:{Choice} Fudge?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fudge?
:'''Boothill:''' Ah, ain't nothin'. Reckon my phone got triggered by mistake, them tight jeans, you know how it is. All's well, no harm done. Muddle-fudger, you're as stubborn as a mule, ain't ya? Go choke on some shirtballs, ya hear me? [Noise detected, unable to recognize]

:{Choice} Is this a livestream?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Got it. You're doing a livestream, aren't you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'll tip you 50 cents if you can drop some more dope lines
:{Choice} Butt dialing again, huh?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ...That's a lot of butt dialing
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just get a new pair of jeans, bro. Or a new phone
:{Choice} Fudge?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Fudge fudge fudge fudge fudge
:'''Boothill:''' Aw shucks, ma bad. Apologies. Was just chattin' with a pal. Nothing to see here. Mighty sorry 'bout that. Later I'll rob a new phone real quick... Um, I mean "buy" a new phone. Hopefully, that'll fix things up, hahaha.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} Please abide by the law for once
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ahem, I know your whole deal is basically being an outlaw
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But it's probably better to pay for a new phone
::'''Boothill:''' Well, shoot, who's talkin' 'bout robbin'? You heard wrong, haha. Gonna buy it fair and square, can't do it any other way.
:{Choice} Why the constant voice messages?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why do you always send voice messages?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm a very shy introvert. Can't handle people yapping at me
::'''Boothill:''' Well, it's just, uh, you know. Didn't hit the books much when I was knee-high to a grasshopper, so, well, yappin' in voice messages comes easier, haha. Don't you be followin' my trail now, ya hear? Gotta hold them reins tight on yer own life.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Gotta cut this short, pardner. I'm off to hunt some varmints, busy as a bee. I mean, catchin' up with "an old friend," it's been ages, haha. Till we meet again, adios.

:{Choice} Why radio silent now?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Say something, or I'm giving up on you
:{Choice} Wrong recipient?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Huh? Wrong recipient?
:'''Boothill:''' Haha, no sirree. I'm campin' near the lonesome stretches of the Kata Desert. When night falls quiet, you can hear the wind, the critters chirpin', and the rustle of wild beasts clear as a bell. Got a nice feel to it, so I reckoned I'd capture a bit of that and shoot it your way to have a listen.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Too bad my stupid phone has such a fudgin' poor recording function. Boy, what a waste. Tell you what, the vibe here is really something. Forkin' awesome. Seriously.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} Send me the coordinates
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I've had enough. Send me the coordinates. I'll teleport there right away
::'''Boothill:''' Ha, well ain't that a hoot. Too bad I've scoped it out, 'round these parts ain't no sign of y'all's Nameless shenanigans&mdash; What's it called? Space Encore? Nope, Space Anchor! It's no man's land here, ya catch my drift?
:{Choice} I do envy you
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds so enjoyable. I'm green with envy
::'''Boothill:''' Ha, true enough. If you're cut out for this kind of life, then it sure is snug as a bug. Ain't kiddin', these sorts of camps ain't easy to stumble upon. Luck's on my side today, mighty comfortable.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Holy forkeroni, this weather, it's downright beautiful. These stars, like flour sprinkled on a coat. Tsk, mighty pretty, truly fine. Far from home, seldom see stars like these. Real pretty sight, tsk tsk.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Well, I'll be forked. Suddenly got a hankerin' for home, forkin' hell.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} Your home?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've never mentioned home before
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What's your home like?
::'''Boothill:''' My home, ha. Long gone, yep. Long gone. Ain't much to say 'bout that.
:{Choice} Cry if you feel like it.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Boys can cry too, you know, crying isn't a crime
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Just don't send me a voice message of it
::'''Boothill:''' Ain't near 'bout bawlin' my eyes out. I reckon I don't even have that function no more. Means, I can't cry no more. Missing home, well, that's as common as dirt, ha.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Shame though, real fudgin' shame. My old homestead's grasslands, not to boast, but lying there was heaven on earth. Not even the top-notch steer in camp could match that grass for comfort. A real pity, that. And that creek, clean as a whistle, I tell ya. Them little fish in it looked like they were just floating in the air, no foolin'.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Come nightfall, you'd plop down in the grasslands, find yerself a rock, face the breeze and strum a guitar or wail on a harmonica &mdash; that's the slice of paradise, crisp and sweet. Darn shame, no chance for that no more. Tut-tut, can't go back no more. Cannot go back anymore.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' When the time comes, I'll show ya what I got, haha. Ain't no boastin', but in the whole camp, I strum the guitar finest. Harmonica too, true story, no fibbin'. Ah, the moon's dip'n low. Time I hit the trail, catch ya later. Thanks for chewin' the fat with me, much obliged.

===Hey, (Trailblazer). I rustled...===
{{Messages|text=
:'''Boothill:''' Hey, (Trailblazer). I rustled up some goods, you interested?
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Lemme tell ya, it's mighty fine, lit as fudge. Just crackin' open the pack, the scent hits yer noggin straight away. Then ya start droolin' like a hound, ya catch my drift. Just a whiff's enough to make ya giddy on cloud nine, taste it, and you're shootin' straight to the moon, hahahaha.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} What sorta stuff is that?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Sounds fishy. What sorta stuff is that?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Where did you get it from?
:'''Boothill:''' Don't go prying. Just know that it took me a heap of elbow grease. Fork it, ya've no idea how many sons of benches have been eyein' this, but today, I finally snagged it. Later, I'll have those lil' forkers hammer away at it, then seal it in a barrel and bury it deep for fermentin', else the purity would never fudgin' cut it. This here's some fine goods, can't let it be squandered on them shirt-for-brains, heh heh heh
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} Hand the goodies over now!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Where did you get these goodies!? Hand them over now!
:{Choice} Sounds suspicious...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is too suspicious. Get rid of them, now!
:'''Boothill:''' Fudge, I'll be hornswoggled. What in tarnation do I gain from givin' it to ya, huh? Have I got bats in my belfry or what? You takin' me for a born fool? Heh, I forkin' reckon not!
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:{Choice} I'm calling the cops then
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm calling the cops then
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 03 Caelus 01.png|80px]] [[File:Sticker PPG 03 Stelle 01.png|80px]]
:'''Boothill:''' You fudgin' threatenin' me, pardner? Pullin' this stunt, huh? Well, shirt, I be forked. Aight, aight, you've got spunk, I like that. A ranger oughta shoot straight, not dilly-dally with all that fudgin' horsefeathers, hahahaha.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Alrighty, it's yers. Shucks. Be here sharp at three system hours tonight, just you, nobody else. I'll shoot ya the coordinates later.
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Voice message converted to text
:'''Boothill:''' Don't you dare waste it, y'hear, or we're gonna have words. This here's malt juice squeezed from premium Lufur watermelon, and in an entire Amber Era, ya be lucky to harvest two yields at best. Don't go wastin' it now. Saved myself just one bottle. Not a drop to spare, you got me? Ugh, shucks.
