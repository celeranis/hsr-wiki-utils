:'''Phainon:''' Hey buddy, you there?
:{Choice} Yep.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yep, what's up?
::'''Phainon:''' Wow, instant reply! I'm touched
:{Choice} Nope.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yeah, just sleeping actually
::'''Phainon:''' Uh oh
::'''Phainon:''' Man, I'd love to rest too, but sleep won't come
:{Choice} Depends &mdash; good news or bad?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It depends &mdash; is it good news or bad?
::'''Phainon:''' Hahahahaha
::'''Phainon:''' No worries. It's nothing bad
::'''Phainon:''' Uh. At least I think so
:'''Phainon:''' With all that's gone down recently, I thought we could talk
:'''Phainon:''' The failed trial, the Grove, Mydei and the Kremnoans, and seeing Tribbie's memories... all of it...
:'''Phainon:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Chimera 02.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Li'l Chimera Sticker&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} Good thing we crushed them all.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's nothing &mdash; we three can crush it!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (And Dan Heng too)
::'''Phainon:''' Hahahahaha
::'''Phainon:''' Absolutely!
:{Choice} About time we got paid.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hmm?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, finally thinking about compensating your {{MC|m=bro|f=sis}}?
::'''Phainon:''' Hahahahaha
::'''Phainon:''' You'll get it. I promise I didn't forget
:'''Phainon:''' But promise me that you won't laugh at this
:'''Phainon:''' Honestly, even though we made it through everything, seeing Tribbie's memories just left me with more questions
:'''Phainon:''' "That person alone will witness the miracle" doesn't sound like a good ending, does it?
:'''Phainon:''' Why did everyone choose to become demigods even after knowing the price?
:{Choice} For the sake of Amphoreus' future.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' To save the world using demigod powers, of course
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm just taking a guess here. The powers you gain as demigods are tiny compared to the cost, after all
::'''Phainon:''' Exactly
:{Choice} For power and status.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Uh, for power and status?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Everyone wants to climb above others. That's human nature
::'''Phainon:''' That's true
::'''Phainon:''' But the price they paid isn't really worth it, right? Just look at Aglaea and Tribbie
:{Choice} They did it for... you?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This is only my theory, so it could be wrong
::'''(Trailblazer):''' But maybe they were paving the path for you, Deliverer
::'''Phainon:''' Now now, don't joke around
::'''Phainon:''' My abilities and resolve are still lacking by a lot. Being Aglaea's apprentice, I'll be lucky not to cause new problems for her
:'''Phainon:''' *sigh*... I should've asked Mydei about his reasons before he left
:'''Phainon:''' But now he's taken all the glory and all the cool spotlights!
:'''Phainon:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Chimera 02.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Li'l Chimera Sticker&rbrack;]]
:{Choice} You have to rely on yourself.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. Just do it
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Show what you're capable of without relying on others
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Caelus 01.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Trailblazer Sticker&rbrack;]] [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Stelle 01.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Trailblazer Sticker&rbrack;]]
::'''Phainon:''' Haha, you've got a point
:{Choice} So it's the competitive spirit talking.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah, sounds like someone's being competitive
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Caelus 01.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Trailblazer Sticker&rbrack;]] [[File:Sticker PPG 20 Stelle 01.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Trailblazer Sticker&rbrack;]]
::'''Phainon:''' Haha, just kidding
:'''Phainon:''' Well, I think I feel a bit better about all this now. I've learned a lot from this conversation. I'll go over what we said in my own time
:'''Phainon:''' Thanks, buddy! We're Amphoreus' only hope!
:'''Phainon:''' Oh wait, there's Dan Heng too. All three of us!
