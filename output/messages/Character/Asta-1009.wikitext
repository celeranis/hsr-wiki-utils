:'''Asta:''' In any case, it'd be greatly appreciated if you could keep us posted. The old man might have gone traveling among the stars with friends from his younger days.

:'''Asta:''' Ahem, I don't usually speak like this. Must have read too much poetry recently
:'''Asta:''' I got an encrypted letter. It must be really good, because I can't understand a single word
:'''Asta:''' You seem pretty smart, so please come back and help me out with this one as soon as you have time. Otherwise, sooner or later, I'll just die from the curiosity alone

:'''Asta:''' The backend detected a weird quantum fluctuation just now. You were right beside it at the time. What happened?
:{Choice} I fixed the Curio
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I just whacked the Curio a few times and the crack on it disappeared. I can't even believe it myself
::'''Asta:''' ...I can't believe it either
:{Choice} I don't understand it myself
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I just whacked the Curio a few times and the crack on it disappeared. I can't even believe it myself
::'''Asta:''' ...Is this what they call a "percussive maintenance?"
:'''Asta:''' The backend data from Panopticon System does show it has been fixed, and is activated at the moment. It's been giving out a steady energy reading
:'''Asta:''' It may be pure luck, but this is too much of a coincidence. Hey, could it be that your hand was blessed by an Aeon?
:'''Asta:''' ...Alright, I'm kidding. No matter how, you are the one who did it. I've sent you the reward. Remember to check it out

::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have a bad feeling about this...
::'''Asta:''' No, no! It's not anything weird. I just need to discuss something with you in person
::'''Asta:''' Since it's just kinda embarrassing to talk about it over messaging
:{Choice} No need to bother you. I'm headed back to the Express
::'''(Trailblazer):''' No need to bother you. I'm headed back to the Express

:{Choice} Got nothing to do with me...

::'''Asta:''' But in the experiment report that she submitted, your name was listed on the assistant column.
:'''Asta:''' Oh, spoil her, would you? I don't even know how her report got through the assessors to me...

:'''Asta:''' I know the Express is there to carry out the trailblaze mission, but there's a question about the Xianzhou I'd like to ask
:'''Asta:''' Have you heard of... the local legend of Xianzhou, the Foxian Beauty Online Chat?

::'''(Trailblazer):''' I haven't heard of it, is it fun?
::'''Asta:''' Hmm, you haven't heard of it? Looks like it's suspicious...
:{Choice} I'm interested
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's very interesting. Send me a link, I'll check it out
::'''Asta:''' I'm not recommending it to you
:'''Asta:''' You misunderstand me. The story starts from a certain staff member...
:'''Asta:''' Oh, I'm not saying the researcher is a foxian beauty!
:'''Asta:''' This is too confusing, let's meet in-person to talk. When you have time, can you come back to the space station and have a little chat with me face-to-face?
:{Choice} I only care about the foxian beauty
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm not interested in researchers. I only care about the foxian beauty. Let's meet and talk more
:{Choice} My time is worth a lot
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Do we really need to talk about this at the space station? My time is worth a lot
::'''Asta:''' Huh? Are you collecting fees to open up your own Trailblazer Chat service? I thought we're friends
::'''Asta:''' Mm-hmm, I did a quick math on my allowance this month, I should have enough to hire you! Come, hireling!
:{Choice} I'll come over when I have the time

:'''Asta:''' And now, I would like you to nurture these little ones
:{Choice} Why me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why me? Wouldn't it be better if you do it yourself?
::'''Asta:''' Among the people I know, you showed as the best match. Also... these things Madam Ruan Mei left behind are kind of related to you

:'''Asta:''' (Trailblazer), did Peppy look for you
:{Choice} Nope
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nope, isn't he at the master control zone?
::'''Asta:''' He's there when he has time to kill, but he's on a mission
:{Choice} Why would he look for me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why would you ask me? I tried calling him over, he wouldn't even lift a paw. Why would he look for me
::'''Asta:''' Peppy's a big boy now, he has his own ideas
:'''Asta:''' A Curio was stolen recently, so I asked him to enlist your help...
:'''Asta:''' I kept seeing him in the storage room, so I thought you met up
:{Choice} A Curio was stolen?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A Curio was stolen? You should allocate more money to upgrade the security system, lead researcher!
::'''Asta:''' Any problem you can solve with money isn't a problem. This is a special case
:{Choice} Why would you send Peppy for me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why would you send Peppy for me? If something's lost, shouldn't you ask the Security Department?
:'''Asta:''' The lost Curio is the Joy Filtration Set, a cube used to store happiness. It's very popular among the researchers, judging by the consistently high application rate
:'''Asta:''' I'd like to start investigating from the researchers, but lately... Madam Ruan Mei has been visiting the station
:'''Asta:''' I'm worried this might not be a good look
:'''Asta:''' Peppy has a sharp sense of smell and does not attract attention wandering about, so I think he is the best for this investigation
:'''Asta:''' I've placed other zones under lockdown when everyone's focused on Madam Ruan Mei's visit
:'''Asta:''' However, Peppy has gone radio silent. I'm concerned that it has run into danger. (Trailblazer), can you go take a look?
:{Choice} Leave it to me.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Leave it to me, this is nothing
::'''Asta:''' Great! I'll share its coordinates with you right away
:{Choice} Why do I feel déjà vu?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait a sec, this all seems eerily familiar...
::'''Asta:''' Don't worry. Peppy's very obedient
:'''Asta:''' Oh, right, I installed a specially made device on Peppy. When you find him, remember to activate the beacon. There's a surprise for you

:'''Asta:''' Peppy alone definitely couldn't do it
:'''Asta:''' He was talking you up ever since he got back
:{Choice} What pitch of woof is he using?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wonder what pitch of woof Peppy makes when he is buttering me up
::'''Asta:''' Next time, you can ask him in person
:{Choice} Easy-peasy.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah, it's nothing. No need to be so polite with me. I just wanted to help you
::'''Asta:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 11 Dr. Ratio 01.png|80px|&lbrack;Tea&rbrack;]]
:'''Asta:''' Alright. Enough about Peppy for now. I actually wanted to talk with you about something else today
:'''Asta:''' You should go back and talk with the robot helper. It discovered something pretty wondrous near its location
:{Choice} How wondrous?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' How wondrous?
:{Choice} I'm on my way.

:'''Asta:''' Thanks for the help with the research, (Trailblazer)
:'''Asta:''' Speaking of which, did you see the creation that looks like Madam Herta? Isn't it interesting? What did it say to you?
:{Choice} (Tell her what happened)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, you're talking about Wisteria Cake. Yeah, she looks a bit like Herta. Even her personality is a bit similar
:'''(Trailblazer):''' And she likes science. That day, she brought a few sidekicks with her and told me she wanted to finish a gene sequencing project, requesting that I nurture more creations for her to use for an in-depth research
:'''Asta:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Asta:''' Though I'm not sure I understand why Madam Ruan Mei's creation will be so similar to Madam Herta
:'''Asta:''' I'm more curious about the "sidekicks" she had with her. Do those also look like other people
:{Choice} Yes, but not that close
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yes, but not as close as you think... It's like running into someone wearing a matching shirt on the street. There are some similarities, but it isn't entirely the same
:{Choice} Yes, they look exactly the same.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Exactly! I think it's almost a splitting image, right? I dub it the Micro-Herta and there is also a Mini-Mei!
:'''Asta:''' The two little critters are pretty special. Their situation... the helper bot sent me the report
:'''Asta:''' Right, the bot said it wants to see you. It sounds like the little one that looks like Herta has some problems
:'''Asta:''' I'm not sure what they're trying to get up to... I have too much on my plate, so I can't leave. Besides, they asked for you specifically. Anyway, (Trailblazer), head over when you have the time
:{Choice} That's a very Herta way of doing things...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' That's a very Herta way of doing things...
:{Choice} I'm on my way.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm on my way.

:'''Asta:''' (Trailblazer), do you know where Peppy has been lately?
:{Choice} Sorry, I didn't pay much attention to Peppy

:{Choice} The same old spots I think
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Peppy? I guess he's still wandering around on the space station. Where else can he go?
:{Choice} Something the matter?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Something the matter?
:'''Asta:''' I'm waiting for the results of Peppy's physical exam from the Medical Department
:'''Asta:''' His front leg appears to be lame, but there is no obvious wound
:'''Asta:''' I checked the surveillance of the space station and didn't see how he hurt his leg
:{Choice} Could he be pretending to be lame?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Well, pets are just as naughty as children. Could he be pretending to be lame on purpose?
::'''Asta:''' I don't know... Peppy is not naughty at all
:{Choice} Just like Arlan?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' According to your description, maybe Peppy also hurt his hand, just like Arlan?
::'''Asta:''' That doesn't make sense. Peppy has no wounds on him
:'''Asta:''' ...
:'''Asta:''' I've got Peppy's test results
:'''Asta:''' It says that he is in perfect health
:'''Asta:''' It says that he is not hurt
:'''Asta:''' There are no signs of fractures anywhere
:'''Asta:''' So, why would Peppy pretend to be lame? What can he get out of it?
:'''Asta:''' I have no idea at all
:{Choice} Maybe he wants you to spend more time with him
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You've been so busy lately. Did you not play with him enough?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So he deliberately pretended to be lame and wanted you to spend more time with him
::'''Asta:''' It's possible. I haven't taken Peppy for a walk recently
::'''Asta:''' I'll have to buy some more of his favorite teeth sticks too
:{Choice} Maybe he is subconsciously imitating Arlan
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe he is subconsciously imitating how Arlan looked before
::'''Asta:''' Arlan injured his hand during the Legion's invasion
::'''Asta:''' Peppy was always with him during that time
::'''Asta:''' You are right. He may be imitating the behavior of the people around him...
:'''Asta:''' The good thing is, Peppy isn't hurt
