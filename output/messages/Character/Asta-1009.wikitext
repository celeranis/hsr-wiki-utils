:{Choice} I fixed the Curio

:'''Asta:''' The backend data from Panopticon System does show it has been fixed, and is activated at the moment. It's been giving out a steady energy reading
:'''Asta:''' It may be pure luck, but this is too much of a coincidence. Hey, could it be that your hand was blessed by an Aeon?

:'''Asta:''' (Trailblazer), thanks a bunch for supporting the AI Herta experiment!
:'''Asta:''' I've already transferred the experiment funds to you. Be sure to check your account.
:{Choice} (Ask about future plans)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So the experiment is officially over? Are there any follow-up plans or other news?
::'''Asta:''' Madam Herta thought it was amusing but didn't provide any real breakthroughs, so she just had me delete everything.
:{Choice} ...Are you the one paying again?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, what experiment funds? Are you paying me out of your own pocket again?
::'''Asta:''' {{tx|Missing sticker}}{{subst:void|<!--SpriteOutput/Emoji/30001.png-->}}
:'''Asta:''' Here's a funny thing. Madam Herta mentioned that "My digital version thinks more highly of (Trailblazer) than I expected."
:'''Asta:''' That's precisely what the experiment was designed to test, whether a copy can match the original's judgment and intelligence.
:'''Asta:''' Based on our observations, AI Herta appears to be... more generous with compliments? Hard to say for sure. But... I suspect that might be why Madam Herta decided to pull the plug on the experiment.

:{Choice} Got nothing to do with me...

::'''Asta:''' But in the experiment report that she submitted, your name was listed on the assistant column.

:{Choice} My time is worth a lot

::'''Asta:''' Huh? Are you collecting fees to open up your own Trailblazer Chat service? I thought we're friends

:{Choice} Nope
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Nope, isn't he at the master control zone?
::'''Asta:''' He's there when he has time to kill, but he's on a mission
:{Choice} Why would he look for me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why would you ask me? I tried calling him over, he wouldn't even lift a paw. Why would he look for me
::'''Asta:''' Peppy's a big boy now, he has his own ideas
:'''Asta:''' A Curio was stolen recently, so I asked him to enlist your help...
:'''Asta:''' I kept seeing him in the storage room, so I thought you met up
:{Choice} A Curio was stolen?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' A Curio was stolen? You should allocate more money to upgrade the security system, lead researcher!
::'''Asta:''' Any problem you can solve with money isn't a problem. This is a special case
:{Choice} Why would you send Peppy for me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Why would you send Peppy for me? If something's lost, shouldn't you ask the Security Department?
:'''Asta:''' The lost Curio is the Joy Filtration Set, a cube used to store happiness. It's very popular among the researchers, judging by the consistently high application rate
:'''Asta:''' I'd like to start investigating from the researchers, but lately... Madam Ruan Mei has been visiting the station
:'''Asta:''' I'm worried this might not be a good look
:'''Asta:''' Peppy has a sharp sense of smell and does not attract attention wandering about, so I think he is the best for this investigation
:'''Asta:''' I've placed other zones under lockdown when everyone's focused on Madam Ruan Mei's visit
:'''Asta:''' However, Peppy has gone radio silent. I'm concerned that it has run into danger. (Trailblazer), can you go take a look?
:{Choice} Leave it to me.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Leave it to me, this is nothing
::'''Asta:''' Great! I'll share its coordinates with you right away
:{Choice} Why do I feel déjà vu?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait a sec, this all seems eerily familiar...
::'''Asta:''' Don't worry. Peppy's very obedient

:{Choice} What pitch of woof is he using?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I wonder what pitch of woof Peppy makes when he is buttering me up
::'''Asta:''' Next time, you can ask him in person
:{Choice} Easy-peasy.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah, it's nothing. No need to be so polite with me. I just wanted to help you

:'''Asta:''' Thanks for the help with the research, (Trailblazer)
:'''Asta:''' Speaking of which, did you see the creation that looks like Madam Herta? Isn't it interesting? What did it say to you?
:{Choice} (Tell her what happened)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Oh, you're talking about Wisteria Cake. Yeah, she looks a bit like Herta. Even her personality is a bit similar
:'''(Trailblazer):''' And she likes science. That day, she brought a few sidekicks with her and told me she wanted to finish a gene sequencing project, requesting that I nurture more creations for her to use for an in-depth research
:'''Asta:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 08.png|80px|&lbrack;Shocked&rbrack;]]
:'''Asta:''' Though I'm not sure I understand why Madam Ruan Mei's creation will be so similar to Madam Herta
:'''Asta:''' I'm more curious about the "sidekicks" she had with her. Do those also look like other people
:{Choice} Yes, but not that close
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Yes, but not as close as you think... It's like running into someone wearing a matching shirt on the street. There are some similarities, but it isn't entirely the same
:{Choice} Yes, they look exactly the same.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Exactly! I think it's almost a splitting image, right? I dub it the Micro-Herta and there is also a Mini-Mei!
:'''Asta:''' The two little critters are pretty special. Their situation... the helper bot sent me the report
:'''Asta:''' Right, the bot said it wants to see you. It sounds like the little one that looks like Herta has some problems
:'''Asta:''' I'm not sure what they're trying to get up to... I have too much on my plate, so I can't leave. Besides, they asked for you specifically. Anyway, (Trailblazer), head over when you have the time
:{Choice} That's a very Herta way of doing things...
