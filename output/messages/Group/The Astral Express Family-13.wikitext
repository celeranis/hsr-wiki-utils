:'''Welt:''' @(Trailblazer) @March 7th @Dan Heng, the sealing of the Stellaron is complete, and the spatial distortion is dissipating. Good job.
:{Choice} We should be back soon
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We should be back soon
:{Choice} We'll need to stay here a little longer
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We'll need to stay here a little longer
:'''Welt:''' Don't rush, go at your own pace. The Express will be here, before you're ready to leave.
:'''March 7th:''' Great!
:'''March 7th:''' I'm craving some juice... Pom-Pom still owes me a glass!
:'''Dan Heng:''' How is Jarilo-VI?
:'''Welt:''' Not great. Even though the influence of the Stellaron has basically subsided, the existing Fragmentum is too deeply rooted.
:'''Welt:''' The Eternal Freeze has lasted a very long time, enough to severely impact the ecology of the planet.
:'''Welt:''' In short, the planet probably won't regain the vitality that it once had a thousand years ago in such a short time.
:'''March 7th:''' Oh... How could this be?
:{Choice} Is there anything else we can do?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Is there anything else we can do?
:'''Welt:''' ...As Trailblazers, our mission has already concluded successfully. The fate of this world should be handed back to its inhabitants.
:'''Welt:''' Humankind has always struggled against austere conditions and had always managed to thrive in spite of it. Now that the Eternal Freeze is gone, the Fragmentum has lost its momentum to expand.
:'''Welt:''' Jarilo-VI will be revitalized. Believe in the perseverance of her people.
:'''Welt:''' I detected a high-frequency spatial energy surge in the north of Jarilo-VI. You might be interested in checking it out.
:'''Welt:''' Don't worry. That energy is not related to the Stellaron. It's only an Echo left behind after spatial distortions fade away.
:'''Welt:''' Inside the Echo, our perceptions of space and time that we are used to will become radically altered, to the point where it might even reconstruct certain scenes from our own past experiences.
:'''Welt:''' If you're in the mood and wish to re-live those memorable adventures, you can try your luck at places where Echoes can be found.

:'''Himeko:''' Pom-Pom has completed the routine pre-departure inspection, so the Nameless is ready to move on to the next world. Come back to the Express when you've tied up all the loose ends
:'''Himeko:''' Oh, right. You must have so many questions about that final battle with the Supreme Guardian of Belobog. Welt and I made some simple analyses that might help shed some light on it for you
:'''March 7th:''' Got it! We will start our preparations now

:'''March 7th:''' Relics
:'''Himeko:''' Relics
:'''Welt:''' These are Relics.
:{Choice} Thanks.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Thanks.
:{Choice} So what's a relic!?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So what's a relic!?
:'''Welt:''' A construct made from a data stream. Many believe they're linked to Stellarons and the Fragmentum phenomenon.
:'''Welt:''' What we refer to as relics are objects corroded by the Fragmentum whose data is saved and then reconstructed.
:{Choice} Thanks.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Thanks.
:{Choice} So what's a relic!?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' So what's a relic!?

:'''(Trailblazer):''' Is everything okay, Dan Heng?
:'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer) and I heard you received an anonymous letter, and we were worried, so we came here to check on you, but you weren't in the archives.
:'''March 7th:''' Did that poker-faced Stellaron Hunter "Blade" give you any trouble again?
:{Choice} I'm okay...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. I just stepped away to enjoy the view.
:{Choice} I went to meet some old friends.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. I just stepped away for a bit to catch up with some old friends.
:{Choice} I've thrown away the letter.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Don't worry. I've got rid of that letter.
:'''March 7th:''' Phew, that's a relief, then.
:'''March 7th:''' By the way, don't forget to head back to the Express early. Himeko said she made coffee for us.

:'''Himeko:''' Is everyone there?
:'''Himeko:''' I have something important to announce
:{Choice} We're getting wages?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We're going to be getting wages after this? Awesome!
::'''Himeko:''' Sadly, no. That's not been planned yet
::'''Himeko:''' The budget for the Nameless' expenditures will still be managed solely by the navigator for the time being. If there is a need among individual passengers, however, you can come to apply for an additional allowance from me
::'''March 7th:''' Speaking of which, why doesn't Mr. Yang ever seem to worry about money...
::'''Himeko:''' Mr. Yang is an exception~
::'''Welt:''' Be envious, young one.
:{Choice} We getting better food?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' The food options on the dining menu are about to be updated? The day has finally come!
::'''Himeko:''' Does Passenger (Trailblazer) have some points of dissatisfaction to raise about the current menu?
::'''March 7th:''' I guess {{MC|f=she|m=he}} is probably about to complain about the pre-made meals again!
::'''Himeko:''' Then, let me give a piece of personal advice: Stop scrolling through food blogger videos
:{Choice} I confess...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Alright, I'll spill. It is I who borrowed away Dan Heng's neck massager
::'''Dan Heng:''' So it was you.
::'''Dan Heng:''' By the way, "borrowing" is when you let someone know. If you don't, that's called "stealing."
::'''Himeko:''' It's just a massager. If (Trailblazer) wants one, we can order one
::'''Himeko:''' I checked the price as well. Let's leave the bill with (Trailblazer)
:'''Himeko:''' Ahem. To business. The thing I wanted to tell everyone is that the Astral Express will soon be one of the shareholders of the Penacony Conglomerate
:'''Himeko:''' The Family and the IPC will begin formal negotiations soon regarding the Dreamscape's reconstruction plans and commercial projects for the future
:'''Himeko:''' After this round of investments, the IPC will hold 30% of Penacony's shares
:'''Himeko:''' And the Strategic Investment Department managed to secure a significant boon for us: When the financing is done, the IPC will transfer 5% of the stocks to the Astral Express to express their sincerity in developing a long-term partnership with the Nameless
:'''March 7th:''' Woah
:'''March 7th:''' Though I don't know much about shares or options... It sounds pretty great!
:'''Welt:''' I'm more curious about how future dividends will be calculated?
:{Choice} Are we gonna be rich?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' So, does that mean we're gonna get financial independence and early retirement soon?
::'''Himeko:''' Oh, my. Have you been living in poverty this entire time, (Trailblazer)? You must have had it rough
:{Choice} Only 5%?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hey, it's only 5%
::'''Dan Heng:''' Clearly, your financial acumen is about on par with March 7th's.
::'''March 7th:''' Hey!
:'''Himeko:''' As the ceaselessly trailblazing Nameless, we got another responsibility to shoulder regarding this agreement
:'''Himeko:''' As shareholders of the Penacony Conglomerate, we must bear the duty of being brand ambassadors and ensure the Planet of Festivities will no longer depart from the proper path of Harmony
:{Choice} Time to wield my shareholder power!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's time to make everyone submit
:{Choice} Penacony, your {{MC|f=girl|m=boy}}boss is here!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It's time to make everyone submit
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Wait, no
:'''(Trailblazer):''' It's time for everyone to remember our name!
:'''Himeko:''' Oh, it seems like (Trailblazer) is full of energy!
:'''March 7th:''' ...
:'''March 7th:''' Hey, what are you doing?
:'''Dan Heng:''' Let {{MC|f=her|m=him}} be, March.
:'''Dan Heng:''' I can tell {{MC|f=her|m=his}} determination from the words {{MC|f=she|m=he}} typed. We can't stop {{MC|f=her|m=him}}.

:{Choice} (Tell them about the gift)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I just received a gift. It got sent to (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Aventurine sent it. This was inside
:'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Message The Astral Express Family 43.png|256px]]
:'''Welt:''' Oh, it's a model. That brand is renowned for making quality products. If I'm not mistaken, this is a limited edition.
:'''March 7th:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 10.png|80px|&lbrack;image&rbrack; &lbrack;gift&rbrack;]]
:'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), open the windows! Are there figures of us inside?
:'''Dan Heng:''' This is a miniature of the Express. Looking at the exterior, I don't think it's designed to be opened.
:'''Welt:''' I used to collect models back home. Based on my experience, if there are additional accessories, they are usually displayed separately.
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Wow! Where did you get that? It's so pretty! I want one too. Shouldn't there be one for the conductor?
:'''Himeko:''' You'll have to ask @(Trailblazer) about that
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Doesn't seem like it. There are only some other snacks and beverages in the package
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe your packages are still on the way... I only received this one
:'''March 7th:''' I don't have a package tracking number...
:'''Welt:''' I didn't receive anything either. Looks like (Trailblazer) is the only one who got it.
:'''Pom-Pom:''' I'll take the snacks if you don't want them!
:'''Dan Heng:''' We shouldn't give the conductor too much junk food. We'll be in trouble if they get the runs.
:'''Himeko:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 02 Himeko 01.png|80px|(image) &lbrack;laugh&rbrack;]]
:'''Himeko:''' Jokes aside, this looks like it's specially prepared for (Trailblazer)
:'''Himeko:''' When we did the handover for (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand) with The Family, we came to a consensus that the ownership of the ship should belong to the Express passenger who contributed the most to Penacony
:'''Himeko:''' In other words, (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand) only has one owner right now, and that is (Trailblazer). This gift is just for you
:{Choice} Thanks! Don't mind if I do!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Ah? Then I'll gladly accept it!
::'''Dan Heng:''' Take it. It's what you deserve.
:{Choice} Whoa, really?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Huh? For real?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hang on, I'm going to get a lottery ticket now. We'll share the winnings among us
::'''March 7th:''' Even if we win the grand prize, you're more than deserving of it!
:{Choice} We should give it to Pom-Pom instead.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I think... it'll be more suitable if we give this to Pom-Pom.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Pom-Pom is the conductor after all, and the conductor should be in charge of the Express.
::'''Pom-Pom:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|&lbrack;image&rbrack; &lbrack;Pom-Pom refuses&rbrack;]]
::'''Pom-Pom:''' Pom-Pom doesn't want it! It's yours. Pom-Pom is just happy to be with all you passengers.
::'''Welt:''' Hehe. Keep it, (Trailblazer).

:'''(Trailblazer):''' Who wants to see it? I'll carry it into the Parlor Car right now!
:'''Welt:''' Congratulations to (Trailblazer) for winning a television
:'''Himeko:''' Looks like you've reaped quite a few rewards from Penacony

:'''March 7th:''' Wait. Why haven't I experienced anything like this? I was at Penacony too! You're just too lucky, (Trailblazer)
:'''March 7th:''' Do you want to place it in the Parlor Car? Once you do, let me know. I wanna touch it. See if I smooch some luck off you
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Congratulations, Passenger (Trailblazer)
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Wait! Hold on! You can't put this in the Parlor Car!
:'''Pom-Pom:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 04.png|80px|(image) &lbrack;no&rbrack;]]
:'''March 7th:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 07.png|80px|(image) &lbrack;suspicion&rbrack;]]
:'''March 7th:''' Why not? Won't it be good for everyone to watch some TV on the couch?
:'''Himeko:''' Hmm. TV and coffee. That just might bring out the taste of home
:'''Dan Heng:''' The Parlor Car is a place to enjoy the stellar view. Pom-Pom has strict rules and regulations for every section of the Express. If we put the TV there, then it'll be the entertainment car, and that clashes with the enjoyment of scenery.
:'''Pom-Pom:''' That's right. If we do this, the Parlor Car will have the Phonograph and a TV. It'll start disturbing everyone else
:{Choice} (Trailblazer) won't leave it there then.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Alright... If even the Passengers don't think this is a good idea, (Trailblazer) just won't leave it there! That should do it, right?
::'''Pom-Pom:''' Don't mock the conductor, Passenger (Trailblazer)
::'''Welt:''' Pom-Pom's speech pattern is not that exaggerated. Anyway, this isn't what's important
:{Choice} You're too strict, Pom-Pom...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|(image) &lbrack;sob&rbrack;]]
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Alright, Pom-Pom... You're so strict. I won't put it there
:'''Pom-Pom:''' You can put it straight in the Passenger Cabin, (Trailblazer)
:'''Pom-Pom:''' It's where the long corridor leads to that armchair. You can place it on the cabinet nearby so everyone can watch it
:'''March 7th:''' I see... You planned this out already, Pom-Pom. No wonder you're the conductor
:'''Pom-Pom:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 02.png|80px|(image) &lbrack;sob&rbrack;]]
:'''Welt:''' If we get the chance, we can have a movie night with the television every now and then
:'''Welt:''' You can watch some of the animations I've made in my homeworld. Some of the content is better viewed on a screen
:'''March 7th:''' Mr. Yang... Please don't fall asleep again...
:'''Pom-Pom:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Like&rbrack;]]
:'''Himeko:''' [[File:Sticker PPG 07 Pom-Pom 06.png|80px|(Image) &lbrack;Like&rbrack;]]
:'''Dan Heng:''' Hm. I'm curious about the television, too. Penacony's devices have some special properties. I don't know if they can still persist beyond memoria-infused environments.

::'''(Trailblazer):''' Good news, I hope?
::'''Himeko:''' Yeah, you could say that
::'''March 7th:''' Great!
:{Choice} Bad news, perhaps...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' I have a feeling it might be bad news...
::'''March 7th:''' Come on! Don't jinx it!
::'''Himeko:''' Of course not. No worries

:{Choice} Time for a warp jump?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' We're gearing up for a warp jump, aren't we?
:{Choice} Hey, hey!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Hey, hey!
::'''Dan Heng:''' ...
::'''March 7th:''' Yes, it's time for a warp jump!
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Exactly
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Regarding our next destination, a passenger has given us a special tip
:'''Pom-Pom:''' As usual, we'll discuss this at the navigation meeting

:'''Himeko:''' Hey~ The space station sent someone over with gifts. I asked the Express conductor to leave the items in the Parlor Car. Please come and help yourselves~
:{Choice} What are the gifts?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' This sounds like Asta's doing. What would someone as rich and eccentric as her send us?
:{Choice} Is today special?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Weird... Is today some kind of special occasion? Why would she suddenly send us gifts?
:'''Himeko:''' It's all snacks and supplies and some interesting gadgets invented by the researchers
:'''Himeko:''' They said they wanted to repay us for our kindness and help back at the space station. Everything is a small token of their appreciation
:'''Welt:''' It was nothing, really. They didn't have to do all this
:'''Dan Heng:''' I have no interest in the gifts, but I appreciate their sentiments.
:'''March 7th:''' Wow! I'll be right there!
:'''Himeko:''' By the way, make sure you come along, (Trailblazer). There's a little robot in here that would be perfect for you
:{Choice} Why me?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Huh? Why me? This is all a bit sudden
:{Choice} Do you people not want it?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' ???
::'''(Trailblazer):''' What kind of robot? Does no one else want it?
:'''Welt:''' After some discussion with the conductor, we figured it would be best for you to take it
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Pom-Pom was going to use it as an Express cleaner. But considering how busy you always are, (Trailblazer), you can probably use an assistant. So, the little robot is all yours
:'''Himeko:''' @(Trailblazer)
:'''Himeko:''' Remember to visit the Parlor Car. We'll keep your stuff here for now
:'''Dan Heng:''' We've got snacks here too.
:'''Pom-Pom:''' Speaking of snacks, there are certain passengers that I would like to remind not to sneak off and eat them all by themselves! Make sure you leave some for others

:'''Pom-Pom:''' Everyone, the train car that entered Amphoreus is still out of contact
:'''Himeko:''' March 7th's condition also seems to be getting worse
:{Choice} Can you read this message?
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Himeko! Welt! Look at me! Can you read the messages I sent!?
:{Choice} The world is doomed!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Himeko! Welt! Come save me! Amphoreus is doomed!
:{{DIcon|Warning}} Message failed to send.
:'''Himeko:''' How's the situation on your end, Welt?
:'''Welt:''' Things are going well so far. Herta invited Screwllum to assist us, and we had a detailed chat in the seclusion zone.
:'''Welt:''' Both geniuses contributed with their knowledge. We're now closer to clearing up the mystery surrounding Amphoreus.
:'''Welt:''' However... there's a lot of unexpected information. It's hard to explain everything in a text message.
:'''Welt:''' I'll send you the meeting notes as a video right now.
:'''Himeko:''' Understood
:{Choice} Can I watch if I go to the space station?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Help me out, Space Anchor. I want to head to the space station and check the meeting records too
