{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=(The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand)|Though you wish it wasn't true, the time has come to bid farewell to Miss Tingyun... This is not a reunion, but maybe that is not such a bad thing. When a reunion is so perfect, it gives you something to look forward to in the future.<br />Go to Radiant Feldspar and meet up with Himeko.}}

That's not to say they have nothing to discuss except the past. It's just that they want to use it to explain how they will move towards the future.}}
