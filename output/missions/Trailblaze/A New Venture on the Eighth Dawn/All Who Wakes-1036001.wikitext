{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Party Car|It has been a while since you awoke from the dream. Staring into the deep sky, you think back on everything you've gained from your adventure so far and begin to grow excited for your next trailblazing expedition. Outside your window, the mysterious air of your destination piques your... Hold on? Why are we still on Penacony?<br />Looks like it's time to discuss your upcoming trip with the rest of the crew.}}

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Amphoreus, The Eternal Land...
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' There is no record of this world in the data bank... Not even a mention of its name.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, that's what Miss Black Swan said. It's a world hidden away from outside observation, with a presence only revealed by the light from the mirror of the Garden of Recollection. It's mysterious, alright.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 mar7th 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 40 mar7th 102 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You haven't been with us on the Express very long, (Trailblazer). Will the journey be too much for you to handle?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nah, it's no sweat.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds scary. Can we go somewhere else?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've been on the Express for nearly two years now...
::{{A|VO chapter3 40 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? Has it been that long?
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' There's no need to be nervous. I understand that it may be difficult for us today to wrap our heads around the idea that there's a world Akivili didn't venture into, but a journey like that was only routine to the Express Crew back then. After all, to trailblaze is to explore the universe's boundaries.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We should consider Pom-Pom's opinion, too. They don't know we're considering Amphoreus as a destination.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Sure, I'll take care of it. That said, Pom-Pom usually stays out of discussions about destinations. The final decision will likely still be on us to make.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' In that case, we'd best take the time to think this over.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! Plus, even if we pass Amphoreus over, we've still got a fuel problem to solve.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's what I thought, too.
::{{A|VO chapter3 40 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Alright, then. For now, I'll let Miss Black Swan know that we're considering The Eternal Land as a destination.
::Can I vote no?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I vote no?
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Of course you can. For now, I'll let Miss Black Swan know that we're considering The Eternal Land as a possible destination, but we're also keeping our options open.
:{{A|VO chapter3 40 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Seeing as how this is going to be an unusual adventure, it'd be good for us to take some time out to make preparations for the journey. Meanwhile, I'll see if I can find out more about Amphoreus from our allies before we depart.
