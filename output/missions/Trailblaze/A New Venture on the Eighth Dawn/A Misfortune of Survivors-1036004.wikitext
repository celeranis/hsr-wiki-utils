{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|As the saying goes: Sow your Tingyun in spring for a healthy harvest in fall...

How did "Tingyun" become "Tingyuns" and how did they traverse from death back to reality?<br />Speak to the others and find out what exactly is going on here.}}
