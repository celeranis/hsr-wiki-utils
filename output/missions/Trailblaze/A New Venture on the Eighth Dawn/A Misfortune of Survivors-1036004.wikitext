{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|As the saying goes: Sow your Tingyun in spring for a healthy harvest in fall... That saying doesn't really seem to apply here, and there is more than one puzzle to be solved. How did "Tingyun" become "Tingyuns" and how did they traverse from death back to reality?<br />Speak to the others and find out what exactly is going on here.}}
