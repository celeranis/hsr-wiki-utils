{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|Although it is not a request to formally join the Express Crew, a former opponent's request to travel alongside you is still worthy of due consideration. That being said... You would really enjoy having a junior you can bully&mdash; you mean give guidance to.}}

:{{A|VO chapter3 47 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Welt, I trust your judgment. If someone is willing to join us on our journey, the Express will be open to them.

:{{A|VO chapter3 47 sunday 101.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' I learn the most valuable lessons from my past opponents. Please say whatever's on your mind.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You are a noble person.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You always want to be in control.

::{{A|VO chapter3 47 player 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 47 player 105 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Maybe you're too pessimistic about humanity, but the Trailblaze isn't like that. We had to learn to have faith before embarking on this path. You must do the same.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have an unrealistic ideal.
::{{A|VO chapter3 47 player 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 47 player 106 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Ideals are good to have, but nothing good comes from getting carried away in fantasies. I can never agree with how you dragged everyone into that world of yours just to fulfill an illusory dream.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We can be friends.
::{{A|VO chapter3 47 player 107 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 47 player 107 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Nothing is for certain, anyway. An enemy yesterday may be a friend today.
