{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|update|Sunday has lost his wings and fallen into the state you now see. He has come to realize that miracles are not to be carried out in the skies but on the ground. And, at the beginning of this precious freedom he had found, he hopes to make his farewells quick and orderly.<br />Bid farewell to this beautiful dream with the help of Wonweek. Make as many unreasonable requests as you need, and you can just owe him a favor for later.}}
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|update|No farewell ever goes smoothly... According to the Bloodhound Family members, something unusual has occurred here.
