|summary       = With Cipher's death, the Dawn Device, sustained by her lies, goes silent and dark. Okhema plunges into eternal night, overrun by beasts of the black tide. Hyacine departs first to assume divine authority at the Vortex of Genesis, bidding the group farewell. You rush back to aid Okhema, confronting the Flame Reaver once more. Despite reinforcements from Mydei and Castorice, the enemy presses forward. Dan Heng holds the line, allowing you and Phainon to advance, and Phainon reveals a plan to send you and Dan Heng home, entrusting guards to escort you from the city. Zagreus, who long masqueraded as the Spirithief, hands Phainon Kephale's Coreflame which Cipher entrusted to him, vanishing with glee as his scheme succeeds. Finally, Phainon alone ventures to the Vortex of Genesis to complete Era Nova.
