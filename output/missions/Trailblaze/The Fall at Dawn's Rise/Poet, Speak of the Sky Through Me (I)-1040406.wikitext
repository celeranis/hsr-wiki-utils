|summary       = Within the Eye of Twilight, you encounter Seliose's two winged companion beasts. Guided by them, you inch closer to Aquila's true form, uncovering the hidden truth of Seliose and the Skyfolk: their fabled glory was a lie. Disillusioned by her kin's folly, the fallen hero fused with the Titan, condemning them to extinction. The Skyfolk of today were merely descendants of an unnamed Chrysos Heir. Undeterred, Hyacine declares her resolve to Seliose, joining you to confront the final Titan &mdash; Aquila, the Eye of Twilight.
