With them unable to descend into dreams, they decide to look around first, only to find a disquieting aura permeating throughout the atmosphere. Following Boothill's backup plan, the two finally meet with his informant, Black Swan. To their surprise, however, she does not meet them alone this time, for she brings a dangerous figure with her: The Emanator of Nihility, Acheron.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Meanwhile, you, the cowboy who is a little late to the party, bring unfortunate news to Dan Heng and Pom-Pom who have stayed guard aboard the Express... There is a strong chance that the Crew members who have entered the dream are in danger, because an Emanator of Nihility is roaming the Dreamscape. You quickly succeed in convincing Dan Heng to accompany you into the Dreamscape and provide assistance, but run into a serious setback as you enter the hotel lobby: Due to strict hotel regulations, you are forbidden from entering Penacony.<br />The astute Dan Heng seems to notice something out of the ordinary and suggests that he goes ahead to investigate alone. You wholeheartedly agree with his view and suggest splitting up to reassure him... Now, the instincts you developed over your many years of being exposed to dangerous situations are telling you that as you have time on your hands, perhaps collecting some information couldn't hurt.}}
