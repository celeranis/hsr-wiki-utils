An irresistible force turns you on your heel as you (willingly) walk towards its source... After all, who can resist such a languid, elegant, and powerful Memokeeper?}}

There was supposed to be an exchange of small talk here with lots of cheesy jokes and callbacks. However, as Himeko and Welt are still concerned about your well-being, this section of banter vanished into thin air. We hope for your understanding and patience in this matter.}}
