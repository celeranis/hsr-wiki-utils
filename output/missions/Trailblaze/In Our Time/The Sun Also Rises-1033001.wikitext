===Head to the VIP Lounge Rest Area and find Dan Heng===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|As the dust settles, Asdana and the entire universe have escaped the fate of becoming puppets to the Order. It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened during this time?<br />Take a look around The Reverie, regroup with your companions, and find out what's been going on.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|As the dust settles, Asdana and the entire universe have escaped the fate of becoming puppets to the Order. It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened during this time?<br />You hear a familiar voice approach from behind you. An irresistible force turns you on your heel as you (willingly) walk towards its source... After all, who can resist such a languid, elegant, and powerful Memokeeper?}}

It seems some time has passed since the Harmonious Choir were defeated... What has happened in this time?<br />You reunite with Dan Heng and meet a new friend: the Galaxy Ranger cowboy, Boothill. There was supposed to be an exchange of small talk here with lots of cheesy jokes and callbacks. However, as Himeko and Welt are still concerned about your well-being, this section of banter vanished into thin air. We hope for your understanding and patience in this matter.}}
