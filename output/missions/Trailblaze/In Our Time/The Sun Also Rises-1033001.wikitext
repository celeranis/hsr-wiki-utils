:<!--1-second delay-->
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 101.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Heh, that's alright. In these times of conflict, for the sake of utmost safety, it is only right that the Alliance steps forward to mediate on behalf of the Astral Express. We must not allow you to take unnecessary risks.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 102.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Furthermore, despite the IPC's eagerness for success, it prioritizes "peace" above all, and The Family, trapped though it may be, professes a desire for "Harmony." The Alliance has always won people over with reason. I firmly believe both parties can indeed put aside their differences and come to a peaceful agreement.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The general possesses a deep understanding of the greater good. With the Xianzhou Alliance mediating, peace for Penacony is within reach.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 103.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' You flatter me! But ultimately, it's been all down to the Express. Without your efforts, this Sweetdream Paradise would have been claimed by the last remnants of "Order" before there was even a shot at peace...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was nothing, really.

::Lemme guess, you were thinking about me... again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I do what I can.

:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 101 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), are you okay? I heard you couldn't wake up. Are you feeling unwell?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 124 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 124 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't worry, Mr. Yang. There's nothing wrong with {{MC|m=him|f=her}}, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} practically burned through a lifetime's worth of jokes on the way here.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What about you, Mr. Yang? I heard that even Miss Robin wasn't spared, and that guy locked you both up...
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's a long story... but, at least Mr. Sunday took it easy on us.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He used an ability called "tuning" to connect our consciousnesses with his. In other words, he imprisoned us within his consciousness.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Thanks to General Jing Yuan's destruction of the Harmonious Choir, we were able to escape.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ah, he used that "tuning" on us, too! Does that mean that we were almost imprisoned as well...?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I can confidently say now, he was truly after a fair fight with us. Had he wanted, he could have easily taken us down... without so much as lifting a finger.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Speaking of the Oak Family head... Where is he now?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 108.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' It's complicated, but in a nutshell, he's now the former Oak Family head.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 109.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The IPC has named him the key figure in The Family's Penacony split, citing a threat to Cosmic peace. He must represent The Family and answer for the unrest caused. His trial is set to take place at Pier Point.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 110.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The Family quickly labeled him and the remnants of the Order as enemies, declaring the turmoil an internal rebellion. This move effectively barred the IPC from intervening in "Family affairs" on both moral and rational grounds.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Everyone really has their own agenda after all...
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Then... what's going to happen to Miss Robin? She and Sunday won't be able to deny their involvement in the Charmony Festival, they're siblings after all...
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 111.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why the sigh, General?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 112.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' I can only say that this incident is an unexpected mess for the girl. The Alliance will try to persuade The Family to consider this matter carefully during mediation.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 113.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' It's time, everyone. The IPC's key members and I have agreed to consult one another before the upcoming negotiation. Do any of you wish to sit in?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Given the general's invitation and the matter's significance to the universe, the Crew will naturally accept. However, if the IPC has any reservations...
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 114.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Why of course you're welcome! They've mentioned that your team is a trusted ally of the IPC in Penacony, so there's no reason not to welcome you.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 115.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Besides, if there can be reliable observers from the Astral Express present, discussions will go more smoothly. So, what do you all think?
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well then, we shall oblige.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 129.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I'm a kind of allergic to those types of situations. I think I'll just head back to my room and start packing.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Not to worry. Himeko and I will take care of things.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I'm afraid I'll also have to return to the Express first. The conductor is worried about us. It's best I go and explain the situation.
:{{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 24 himeko 105 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Thank you. What about you, (Trailblazer)? Will you join Welt and me, or have you got other plans?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll go with Miss Himeko.
::{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 116.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Haha, great.
::I HAVE TO help March pack her suitcase...
::{{A|VO chapter3 24 mar7th 130.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What? I can pack it myself, you know...
::{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 117.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Haha, if that's the case, our Galactic Baseballer can join us.

::{{A|VO chapter3 24 topaz 102.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' In summary, it's good news &mdash; after much deliberation from the Strategic Investment Department's council, the absolute majority of members have agreed to the following resolutions:
::{{A|VO chapter3 24 topaz 103.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' "In light of long-term considerations for interastral peace, and by authority of Pier Point HQ, the Strategic Investment Department &mdash; on behalf of the Interastral Peace Corporation &mdash; will permanently relinquish its claim on Penacony sovereignty, and offer unconditional support of The Family's rebuilding efforts on Penacony."

::{{A|VO chapter3 24 jingyuan 122.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Heh, now that's something.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, the IPC does see the big picture, huh?
:::{{A|VO chapter3 24 aventurine 104.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' "All in the name of peace" &mdash; that's our motto.
