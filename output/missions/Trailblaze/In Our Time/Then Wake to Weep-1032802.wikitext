:{{A|VO chapter3 22 misha 101.ogg}} '''Misha:''' What is this place...?
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Does this place ring any bells, Misha?
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 misha 102.ogg}} '''Misha:''' I... don't know, but I feel a sense of déjà vu. What is this place?
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's the realm within a dream bubble. This was left to the Astral Express by a Nameless, but weirdly when we entered it, it was completely empty.
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Dr. Edward from the Dreamscape Sales Store told me that dreams are formed from memories, and a dream bubble can't take shape if its core is empty.
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' So I thought you might be able to help us in unraveling this mystery, Misha? As a hotel {{Rubi|doorman|bellboy}}, you know Penacony best among us.
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 misha 103.ogg}} '''Misha:''' Hmm, I don't know much about dream bubbles, but if you want to figure out what this mansion is... I'll do my best!
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I'm counting on you then.
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Himeko... I still don't get it. Why were you so sure that {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Misha had a connection with this dream bubble}}?
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I wasn't sure. It was just a hunch, but since Misha feels familiar with this place... my hunch might be correct.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This place looks a bit familiar...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This place feels a bit nostalgic...
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Exactly, this is where you and Firefly encountered "Death," which we now know as "Dormancy." Considering its connection to Dreamflux Reef, it's not surprising it appeared here.
:{{tx}}
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=A Child's Dream|update|Time reverses to the point before you left Dreamflux Reef. Himeko returns from Golden Hour with a powerful deduction: There may be some inextricable link between the empty dream bubble that the Watchmaker is holding and Misha the bellboy.<br />In order to prove it, you take Misha back into Mikhail's dream bubble... If everything goes as expected, the truth may be lurking here in this long dream of the child.}}

:{{A|VO chapter3 22 himeko 118.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Have you recalled anything, Misha?
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 misha 138.ogg}} '''Misha:''' Yeah, I saw these sentences in Grandpa's logbook. He used to say that despite the perils of the sea, whenever he stood on the deck in the afternoon, overlooking the sparkling waves, he would think of this fountain in front of his house.
:{{A|VO chapter3 22 misha 139.ogg}} '''Misha:''' He often said that those moments felt like returning to his family's side, and the difficulties at sea didn't seem quite as challenging.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|Dear future Nameless:<br /><br />I have been waiting for you all this time, future Nameless. Though I know not where you come from, what you look like, or even your name... For now, please allow me to call you the "Trailblazer".<br />I am sure you have learned of who I am by now... A former Astral Express maintenance engineer, an apprentice of little promise, and an old man who lived an entirely unremarkable existence. I set out on the Trailblazing journey so I might learn about life itself and everything within. However, the more I learned, the more I found myself lost in confusion and distress. I thought that I would be able to learn how to live a better life, but all I learned was how to elegantly face the ending fate has paired you with... "Nihility".<br />Everyone in life will eventually find their own answer &mdash; to resist or to obey fate &mdash; but these questions do not belong to Trailblaze. Although, I fear this question may simply be too profound. I fear even Akivili THEMSELF would not be able to provide a single answer that is unique to Trailblaze. However, as a Nameless... as a person... we have the right to reflect. We have the right to act. We have the right to define our own endings. We have the right to move forward. As we advance down the road to our own ending, there are many things that people are capable of, and our endings will thus take on a completely new meaning. A Nameless does not indulge in temporary dreams, nor would they forsake their birth rights due to pain and suffering.<br /><br />Do you still recall the question I left in my invitation letter, Trailblazer? "Why does life slumber?"<br /><br />"People slumber so that, eventually, they can awaken from their dreams." ...This is the answer that an old Nameless devoted his entire life to finding.}}
