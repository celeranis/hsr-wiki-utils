{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|Firefly explains to you the deeper reasons behind her various inexplicable behaviors, and guides you to dive deeper into a place declared as a "nightmare" by The Family... The primitive Memory Zone outside the sweet dream: "Dreamflux Reef." This move also exposes some of the truths behind "Death" &mdash; It is nothing but a tamed memetic entity that assists specific people who wish to travel between dreams. "Closing your eyes" is merely a strange invocation used to summon them.<br />After a brief moment of discomfort, you realize that you have arrived at an abandoned old town. Once you have spoken with everyone and prepared yourself, alight and begin your adventure at this abandoned station.}}

:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 123.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' I know you have many questions... Do you remember when we encountered "Death" in that strange Dreamscape? When I was caught by that meme...
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 124.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' In that instant before it killed me, I saw the reflection of another Dreamscape in its ghastly pupils.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 125.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' So, following the clues in the '''script''', I came up with some theories about the meme. That's why I instructed Silver Wolf to issue invitations, drawing everyone to the dream's hotel...
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 126.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' I intended to call upon "Death" before you arrived, to solve the riddle using more direct means, and then invite you to join. However, contrary to my wishes, I couldn't defy the '''script''', and I didn't get a chance to explain it to you.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 127.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' It is how you see now &mdash; I was impaled by the bladed wings of "Death." The heavy pressure of concentrated memoria miasma... exploded in my mind, as if it was actually reality.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 128.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' But after the momentary numbness subsided, I found that my body was absolutely unscathed.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 129.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' I was still alive, and it was just as I thought &mdash; I had arrived at a place starkly different from this beautiful dream. Beneath the Dreamscape of Penacony lies another more chaotic, more primal Memory Zone. Its name... Land of the Exiles.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 130.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' And so then I returned to the hotel in the Dreamscape, hoping to tell you of its existence. Yet I could not reveal my own identity, so I could only divert your party's attention and lure you away from the battlefield.
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 131.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' And after, all my attempts proved futile. It wasn't until not long ago, when a crimson blade of light shattered the high wall of the dream, causing you all to fall far into the abyssal depths of the Dreamscape, that I was able to awaken you and your companions one by one...
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 132.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' And that's it, that is all that's happened so far.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm completely confused!
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 133.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' I know it's tough to believe all this without reservations. I just want to say you're very close to the final answer &mdash; just one more thing needs to be done, and then I can prove it to you...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Yang, you're here too?
:{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 140.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' "Close your eyes"... This is the answer. Isn't it incredible? The monster that we have always known as "Death," is actually the guardian of the land of the exiles. It abides by a certain rule, abducting people from their dreams and bringing them here.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Acheron's blade slash...
::{{A|VO chapter3 17 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' No wonder Miss Acheron is so averse to drawing her blade... it's hard to imagine such terrifying power could reside in an ordinary sheath. If it weren't for the fact that Aventurine's power originated from the Preservation, the entire Dreamscape would have been affected.

:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why couldn't you reveal your true identity?
::{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 144.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' Two reasons: Firstly, the '''script''' &mdash; in the future that Elio saw, Sam and the Astral Express' confrontation was inevitable. I tried to break the shackles of the prophecy, but this is as far as I could go.
::{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 145.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' That aside... there were also my personal motives. I wished to travel with you as Firefly... and not Sam.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's all right. I didn't take it personally.

::{{A|VO chapter3 17 firefly 148.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' Elio only gave me one instruction: Allow the Astral Express to pursue the Grand Legacy. It means that the Watchmaker's Legacy holds great significance to Trailblazing, and to you.
