===Advance down the narrow alley{{subst:void|<!--103240101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|Firefly explains to you the deeper reasons behind her various inexplicable behaviors, and guides you to dive deeper into a place declared as a "nightmare" by The Family... The primitive Memory Zone outside the sweet dream: "Dreamflux Reef." This move also exposes some of the truths behind "Death" &mdash; It is nothing but a tamed memetic entity that assists specific people who wish to travel between dreams. "Closing your eyes" is merely a strange invocation used to summon them.<br />After a brief moment of discomfort, you realize that you have arrived at an abandoned old town. Once you have spoken with everyone and prepared yourself, alight and begin your adventure at this abandoned station.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|As the door opens, a cold and uninspiring plaza comes into view, along with two skyscrapers that had long past their glory days. Just as you decide to split up, a familiar figure catches your and Welt's attention... What could the bellboy of The Reverie be doing in the "nightmare"? Sensing something was amiss, you decided to go and speak with him, lest you lose sleep at night over this inexplicable phenomenon.}}

If that is the case, you can only imagine how bad the treatment must have been at The Reverie. Although, the cute and naïve Misha has not taken that to heart. In fact, seeing that you are in trouble, he offers to lead you on a search for your lost companions and give you a tour of the desolate town along the way. Not only that, you may even have a chance to meet with an old friend... Robin.<br />Before this, however, you need to regroup with March 7th and Himeko. There is no time to lose. Better hurry after Misha.}}

However, before you can go in search of Himeko, you will need to find a local to look after this poor soul that was scared unconscious by the pink spirit of Dreamflux Reef.

Coincidentally, this mild-mannered man who calls themselves the "Gravekeeper" is actually one of the people responsible for this land of Dreamflux.<br />Your appearance in this land doesn't seem to surprise him in the slightest. He says that he would be able to take you to get a deeper understanding of Dreamflux Reef, but you must travel alongside a certain "special guest"... If you are not mistaken, this "guest" is quite likely Miss Robin.}}
