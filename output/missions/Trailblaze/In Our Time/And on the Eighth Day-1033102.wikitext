===Say your final farewells to Acheron===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Horizon of Existence|The golden dream is about to become restless.<br />In the long night that will follow, I fear that you may encounter countless setbacks and witness endless tragedies. In the end, only black and white will be left in your vision.<br />But you must have faith. That black-and-white world will have a fleeting moment of crimson. But, when you make your decision...<br />...It will reappear once again.<br />And you, you must carefully ruminate on its meaning, then return to the waking world.<br />We will find our answer there.}}
