As you watch his figure from behind, you fall into deep reflection: Is it really right to rely on something as intangible and invisible as a fantasy as your only option in life?<br />Seeing your concern, Sunday suggests exploring the area before the Dreammaster arrives... Perhaps, there will be an answer to your doubts to be found?}}
