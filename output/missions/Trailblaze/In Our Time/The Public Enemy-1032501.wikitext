With everyone aligned on how to handle the Stellaron, the Watchmaker &mdash; a former Nameless called Mikhail &mdash; has also bequeathed a valuable inheritance to the Crew. But just as you are prepared to receive this gift, you discover that the legacy is nowhere to be found.

===Ask Gallagher about the situation{{subst:void|<!--103250101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|You originally thought you would just be meeting with the Express Crew, but the group you have now amassed is massive... Gallagher, Micah, Misha, Firefly, Robin, Sunday... And it seems that the person who led to the creation of this lively scene was precisely the seemingly indifferent Gallagher himself.<br />If this isn't just because he's lonely and wants to spend some time with everyone, then he must be secretly formulating some kind of shocking conspiracy... Fortunately, he doesn't seem to bear you any ill will. Perhaps you will be able to grasp the full picture of your surrounding situation peacefully.}}

;(Talk to Gallagher)
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 118.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' I promised to give the siblings some privacy, so let's talk about our business first. What do you say?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That sounds sensible enough. Since you went through the trouble of gathering The Family head, the Crew, and the Stellaron Hunters, I'm guessing you have something important to say, Mr. Gallagher?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 119.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Oh, is it that obvious?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The look on your face is practically screaming "I'm the one behind all this..."
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 120.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Hahaha, you're right, Mr. Yang. It is indeed time to come clean on everything.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 121.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' The siblings already know what they need to, and they've made their choice. But you Nameless arrived a bit late, so it's only fair that I answer your questions.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 122.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Before we begin, let me reintroduce myself. I'm the founder of Dreamflux Reef, the deputy of the Watchmaker, and... the one who sent out that invitation...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 123.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' As Gallagher the History Fictionologist, I humbly extend my greetings to you all.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' History Fictionologist? So, what? everything you told us was made up?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 124.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Well, don't worry. Almost everything I shared was true... well, except for the part about "The Family accepting me back."
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I double-checked with Micah, and everything he said about The Family, the Watchmaker, and Mikhail is true.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 125.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Thank you for your understanding! Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're all wondering why I went through the trouble of setting up this battle for the legacy, inviting different factions, and stirring up a ruckus all over Penacony...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 126.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Well, it all boils down to something very familiar to all of you... the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Stellaron? But how is that possible? Penacony is a free-flowing interstellar hub. There are no signs of contamination whatsoever.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 127.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' You're totally correct. So, care to take a guess at what that means?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Stellaron has been completely sealed?
::{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 128.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' I wish that were the truth! But, if that were the case, I wouldn't have invited all of you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Someone is manipulating the Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 129.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' How keen! Well, what should I say? I expected nothing less from the person here who is the most familiar with Stellarons.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're pulling our leg again!
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 130.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' The sweet dream doesn't come out of thin air. If you think of the Memory Zone as the sea, creating the land of the dreams is like filling that wild ocean with earth to make an island.

:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Sure enough... the Watchmaker is the third Nameless. Even I could guess that one.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 172.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' The legacy he left behind was a dream bubble. I believe inside that bubble, there's something that holds meaning only for the Nameless.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 173.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' After all, when I checked its contents, I found nothing inside ... Maybe some Trailblaze runes? Even more enigmatic than me.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 115.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well, let's have a look.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Touch the dream bubble in Mikhail's hand.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 118.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait, what's going on...?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 119.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Seriously... there's nothing inside this dream bubble?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 116.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 120.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' How could a dream bubble be empty?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 174.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Hmph, just as I suspected.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 175.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' That old man always had this strange belief in the Nameless and the Trailblaze, and I never understood where he got that confidence from... especially since he never managed to get in touch with the Express while he was alive.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 176.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' I could never figure out what was going on in that old man's head, but this empty dream bubble is so typical of him. He was always full of weird fantasies... and incomprehensible romanticism.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 177.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' That mischievous old man... Well, I didn't expect him to leave anything concrete behind anyway.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 117.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 118.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Don't think that's the case, Gallagher. I'm sure Mikhail has left us the most precious thing of all.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 178.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Heh, don't start getting all philosophical on me, alright?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 119.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Just as Mikhail believes in the Nameless of the future, we unconditionally believe in the Nameless of the past. How could they leave with regrets for the future when they were ready to dedicate their lives to the land they loved?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' There must be something contained in this dream bubble. It's just we haven't figured it out yet. You also have faith in the Watchmaker, don't you, Gallagher?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 179.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Well, I'm a follower of the Enigmata. My philosophy forbids me to have faith in anything.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 180.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' ...That's why I understand what "faith" means in the Path of Trailblaze, and I also want to know what he left behind. Heh, I'll leave it to you guys then.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 121.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Can I borrow your {{Rubi|pet|"Dormancy"}}? I need to make a trip back to Golden Hour and check something at the Dreamscape Sales Store...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 122.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's for Mikhail, and for the future of Penacony.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 micah 107.ogg}} '''Micah:''' Well I did my job &mdash; I gathered everyone here. Gallagher will explain the rest to you... Take care.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 robin 102.ogg}} '''Robin:''' Brother...!
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 sunday 112.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' ...There's no need for words. You're safe, and that's all that matters.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 misha 101.ogg}} '''Misha:''' Huh? The atmosphere sure has livened up with all these people in here...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 firefly 103.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' I brought Gallagher here. It's time... to face the "truth."
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 misha 102.ogg}} '''Misha:''' You all look quite serious... Is there anything I can do to help?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 firefly 104.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' As I suspected, the core of this issue lies within... the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 149.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Go ahead. I'm sure Mr. Wings holds all the answers.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Everyone, let's gather over here &mdash; we still need to make some preparations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How could this be?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try to focus and capture memories...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take a deep breath and try to read the dream bubble again...
:How could this be?
