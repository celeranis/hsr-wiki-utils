With everyone aligned on how to handle the Stellaron, the Watchmaker &mdash; a former Nameless called Mikhail &mdash; has also bequeathed a valuable inheritance to the Crew. But just as you are prepared to receive this gift, you discover that the legacy is nowhere to be found.

===Ask Gallagher about the situation{{subst:void|<!--103250101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|You originally thought you would just be meeting with the Express Crew, but the group you have now amassed is massive... Gallagher, Micah, Misha, Firefly, Robin, Sunday... And it seems that the person who led to the creation of this lively scene was precisely the seemingly indifferent Gallagher himself.<br />If this isn't just because he's lonely and wants to spend some time with everyone, then he must be secretly formulating some kind of shocking conspiracy... Fortunately, he doesn't seem to bear you any ill will. Perhaps you will be able to grasp the full picture of your surrounding situation peacefully.}}

===Learn the whereabouts of the Stellaron from Sunday{{subst:void|<!--103250103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|You originally thought you would just be meeting with the Express Crew, but the group you have now amassed is massive... Gallagher, Micah, Misha, Firefly, Robin, Sunday... And, it seems that the person that led to the creation of this lively scene was precisely the seemingly indifferent Gallagher himself.<br />He shares the true nature of the Planet of Festivities with the Express Crew: It is a deliberate and controlled Stellaron disaster. However, as for the current location of the Stellaron, he cannot be sure... Now, all you can do is hope that the seemingly rebellious Family leader, Sunday, will cooperate with your work.}}

===See what Welt has to say{{subst:void|<!--103250104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|All related parties present have reached a consensus to eliminate the Stellaron. The righteous and upstanding Halovian siblings have even expressed willingness to utilize their identities to seek out a resolution from inside The Family itself.<br />Though things seem to be developing satisfactorily, Welt still has some doubts... Go and see his views on the matter.}}

===Follow Gallagher and meet with the "Watchmaker"{{subst:void|<!--103250105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|Welt points out the severity of the situation and how one must always be prepared for the worst-case scenario. In an effort to avert the unthinkable, he bids a solemn farewell to everyone before throwing himself into the fray by accompanying the Halovian siblings on their journey to open negotiations with the Dreammaster. This leaves you to continue searching for other ways to avert the situation. To this end, Gallagher finally becomes willing to reveal the whole truth... Due to his innate distrust of The Family, he had not previously exposed everything regarding the "Watchmaker."<br />Gallagher explains that the "Watchmaker" seems to have left behind a precious inheritance for the Astral Express... And that this inheritance could perhaps be the key to sealing the Stellaron.}}
