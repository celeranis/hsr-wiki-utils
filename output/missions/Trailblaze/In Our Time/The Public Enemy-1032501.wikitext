With everyone aligned on how to handle the Stellaron, the Watchmaker &mdash; a former Nameless called Mikhail &mdash; has also bequeathed a valuable inheritance to the Crew. But just as you are prepared to receive this gift, you discover that the legacy is nowhere to be found.

===Ask Gallagher about the situation{{subst:void|<!--103250101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|You originally thought you would just be meeting with the Express Crew, but the group you have now amassed is massive... Gallagher, Micah, Misha, Firefly, Robin, Sunday... And it seems that the person who led to the creation of this lively scene was precisely the seemingly indifferent Gallagher himself.<br />If this isn't just because he's lonely and wants to spend some time with everyone, then he must be secretly formulating some kind of shocking conspiracy... Fortunately, he doesn't seem to bear you any ill will. Perhaps you will be able to grasp the full picture of your surrounding situation peacefully.}}

;(Talk to Gallagher)
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 118.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' I promised to give the siblings some privacy, so let's talk about our business first. What do you say?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That sounds sensible enough. Since you went through the trouble of gathering The Family head, the Crew, and the Stellaron Hunters, I'm guessing you have something important to say, Mr. Gallagher?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 119.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Oh, is it that obvious?
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The look on your face is practically screaming "I'm the one behind all this..."

:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 121.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' The siblings already know what they need to, and they've made their choice. But you Nameless arrived a bit late, so it's only fair that I answer your questions.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 122.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Before we begin, let me reintroduce myself. I'm the founder of Dreamflux Reef, the deputy of the Watchmaker, and... the one who sent out that invitation...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 123.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' As Gallagher the History Fictionologist, I humbly extend my greetings to you all.

:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 124.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Well, don't worry. Almost everything I shared was true... well, except for the part about "The Family accepting me back."
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I double-checked with Micah, and everything he said about The Family, the Watchmaker, and Mikhail is true.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 125.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Thank you for your understanding! Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're all wondering why I went through the trouble of setting up this battle for the legacy, inviting different factions, and stirring up a ruckus all over Penacony...
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 126.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Well, it all boils down to something very familiar to all of you... the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Stellaron? But how is that possible? Penacony is a free-flowing interstellar hub. There are no signs of contamination whatsoever.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 127.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' You're totally correct. So, care to take a guess at what that means?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Stellaron has been completely sealed?
::{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 128.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' I wish that were the truth! But, if that were the case, I wouldn't have invited all of you.
::Someone is manipulating the Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter3 18 gallagher 129.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' How keen! Well, what should I say? I expected nothing less from the person here who is the most familiar with Stellarons.
::You're pulling our leg again!

:{{A|VO chapter3 18 robin 104.ogg}} '''Robin:''' To be honest, my brother and I are also victims of the Cancer of All Worlds. We grew up as orphans and were adopted by The Family when they came to help. Mr. Gopher Wood recognized our potential and brought us to Penacony.
:{{A|VO chapter3 18 robin 105.ogg}} '''Robin:''' But I can't just stand by and watch Mr. Gopher Wood become an enemy of the Harmony. I won't use my voice to support an evil cause...

===Follow Gallagher and meet with the "Watchmaker"{{subst:void|<!--103250105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|Welt points out the severity of the situation and how one must always be prepared for the worst-case scenario. In an effort to avert the unthinkable, he bids a solemn farewell to everyone before throwing himself into the fray by accompanying the Halovian siblings on their journey to open negotiations with the Dreammaster. This leaves you to continue searching for other ways to avert the situation. To this end, Gallagher finally becomes willing to reveal the whole truth... Due to his innate distrust of The Family, he had not previously exposed everything regarding the "Watchmaker."<br />Gallagher explains that the "Watchmaker" seems to have left behind a precious inheritance for the Astral Express... And that this inheritance could perhaps be the key to sealing the Stellaron.}}
