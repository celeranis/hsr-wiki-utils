:{{A|VO chapter3 21 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Unbelievable, to think that there would be... remnants of the Order on Penacony.
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What have you done with Mr. Yang and Miss Robin!?
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 101.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Don't worry. I just gave them some time alone to ponder their fates.
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You should know that these actions make you an enemy of the Astral Express.
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 102.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Should we need to stand against the Nameless, it would only be myself and the Oak family involved. But we haven't reached that point yet, have we?
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 103.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Your efforts for the justice of Penacony are evident to everyone and have been widely observed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want to talk terms with us?
::{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 104.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Smart kid. You're just as sharp as the other one.
::Stop beating around the bush and get to the point.
::{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 105.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Patience is a virtue. However, I won't hold it against you. On the contrary, I'm here to make my intentions clear.
::Give Mr. Yang back to us, now!

:{{A|VO chapter3 21 sunday 106.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Oh I intend to, but that hinges on the outcome of this negotiation.
:{{A|VO chapter3 21 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' If it is the Order that drove you to imprison Welt and Robin, and you're using them to coerce our compliance, then there'll be no point in entertaining any type of discussion.

Here, he finally reveals his true intentions, but he does not seem to want to fight you, instead seeking the possibility of reaching a mutual understanding.<br />He asks you a series of questions that leave you a little lost, but fear not - if you are confounded by Sunday's questions, just look for the answers in your personal experience.}}
