{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|Black Swan reveals a bone-chilling truth to you: It turned out the entire Express Crew, as well as everyone in Penacony, lost their lives in their battle against Sunday. There were no survivors.<br />However, there is still a chance to turn this around. The Memokeeper points out that there is a fatal flaw in the story that you experienced. Behind this fatal flaw lies a glimmer of hope.<br />Now, you have seen through the illusion of Ena's Dream... However, if you wish to awaken everyone in Asdana, you will need far more people on your side...}}

:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 135.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' This way, darling.
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 101.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Not another one...
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 102.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Thank you so much, Black Swan.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 136.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Finally, I can breathe a sigh of relief.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is this place?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The déjà vu is strong with this scene...
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 103.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' I understand you must be confused, and we'll do our best to shed light on the situation. However, before that, it's essential to know that...
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 137.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Do you remember Sunday's ambitious plan? He intended to harness the power of the Stellaron, the collective will of over 100,000 Oak Family members, and the desires of everyone in Penacony to usurp the Harmony and restore the Order.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 105.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Unfortunately, it didn't stop there. From the early days of our journey into Asdana, we were already affected by the Stellaron. That strange Dreamscape where we met... Maybe it was a sign that your thoughts were beginning to drift away.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} All of this is just a dream?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did I fall asleep on the Express?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm now back at the beginning of the story?
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 106.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' I don't think... the goal of the Order was to put everyone into a deep sleep. Quite the contrary &mdash; they used the Stellaron to catalyze the leakage of Asdana's memoria into the material world, allowing the Dreamscape to blend with reality.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 107.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' ...And that included a lot of memoria from the Beyond the Sky Choir. As time came and went, the dreams eventually became indistinguishable from reality, and reality became an illusion. People think they are awake, but their spirits have long since stepped into the temple of Order.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 138.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' This is what makes Ena's Dream so powerful. In this paradise governed by the Order, everyone indulges in their delightful dreams and lives happily ever after.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 139.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' I believe what you experienced in the sweet dream, except for that flaw, was real. Only in this way could you reach the destination, lifting the crisis in Penacony and embarking on your next trailblazing expedition.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 140.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' If it wasn't for Acheron's plan, we might have been trapped in this dream forever.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 108.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Fortunately, while the Path of the Order governs all things, it can't affect the Nihility. I came to realize this when the Dreammaster tried to expel me at any cost.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 141.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' This is also why you felt a sense of peculiarity when traveling with her.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 142.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Well, I'm not as fortunate as she is. Even if I'm a Memokeeper, I was still influenced by the power of the Order and fell into hallucinations.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 143.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' However, thanks to your memories, now we still have a chance to turn the tide.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 109.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' For mortals, even if they possess the great power of a Path, they can't create a flawless world like Gods do.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 110.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' That's why there was a {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|flaw}} in your dream. In other words, once you have realized the world is not real, you'll have a chance to break free from the dream.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 144.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' The flaw in your dream lies within Misha, who could have never appeared in reality. When I turned the pages of your memories, I realized that I was in an illusion, too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We still have a fighting chance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, we lost...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Didn't expect it all comes back to Misha...
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 111.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Now Sunday has usurped the power of the {{Rubi|Harmonious Choir|Shared Wish's Harmonious Embodiment}} through the Charmony Festival. Asdana has thus fallen into Ena's Dream, transforming everyone equally into the {{Rubi|notes|puppets}} of the Aeon.

:{{A|VO chapter3 25 acheron 117.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Let me introduce you to Robin. She woke up from Ena's Dream by her own will, and it's this tough lady who led us here with her song.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 robin 102.ogg}} '''Robin:''' I woke up for the same reason as all of you. In the dream, I experienced something that could never occur in reality...
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 shaonv 101.ogg}} '''Robin:''' Are we going to lock it up in a cage? I want to see it fly freely in the sky.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 shaonian 101.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Without us, this bird would be too fragile to survive on its own. Do you want it to die?

:{{A|VO chapter3 25 shaonv 103.ogg}} '''Robin:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 shaonian 104.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Birds have wings because they're meant to fly. Even if they may crash on the ground one day, they shouldn't be trapped in a cage.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 shaonian 105.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' Birds belong to the sky, so we should help them return there, right?
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 robin 103.ogg}} '''Robin:''' ...The illusion was so impossibly blissful that I realized it was just a dream.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 robin 104.ogg}} '''Robin:''' And this is our final hope. Ena's Dream is founded upon the Harmonious Choir, namely everyone's shared wishes. It will only materialize once the aspirations of all beings in Penacony merge as one.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 robin 105.ogg}} '''Robin:''' At present, it has become impervious due to people's desire to remain slumbering within the dream. And in order to destroy it...

:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 147.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Now comes the tricky part. How do we do it?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That doesn't sound simple at all...
::That doesn't sound simple at all...
::Maybe we should just go back to Ena's Dream?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe we should just go back to Ena's Dream?
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 148.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' You want to go back? Unfortunately, human consciousness always gravitates toward reality. Now that you've seen the flaw in the dream, there is no turning back.
:{{A|VO chapter3 25 blackswan 149.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Humans' yearning for sweet illusions borders on obsession, leading them to subconsciously resist... the harsh reality.
