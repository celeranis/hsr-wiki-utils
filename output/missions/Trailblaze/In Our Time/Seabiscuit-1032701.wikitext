Heeding March 7th's advice, you take advantage of the preliminary contests happening at the SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions, claim the title of champion, and earn the right to enter the Grand Theater early.

:{{A|VO chapter3 20 gallagher 101.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' You're back sooner than I thought... Any results?
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Yes... And now, it's up to us to forge ahead.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 gallagher 102.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Hmph, since his last will has now been conveyed, my final mission is complete.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 gallagher 103.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' But, pardon me if I sound curt &mdash; it's good to have determination, but the path Mikhail left for you is not an easy one to tread...
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 gallagher 104.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' Why else would he have chosen to sleep in solitude, staking everything on some Nameless in the future?
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 gallagher 105.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' But you have the numbers, and in numbers comes strength. So that might just delay your inevitable a little more.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Got any more encouraging words?
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' As I see it, relying on Welt's negotiations alone is far from enough. Regardless of whether the other party will be compliant, negotiating simply allows us to meet them as equals, it won't grant us an upper hand.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Penacony is our rival's home turf, and we already have very few chips left to play with. Rather than idly sit around while The Family's got us blocked off, an offensive approach might be a wiser course of action.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' We're more familiar with the Stellaron's properties than most, and since it's the key to stabilizing the sweet dream, it's vital to The Family's interests. By attacking their core interests, they're bound to retaliate hastily... and as the saying goes: Haste makes waste.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 firefly 101.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' That's right &mdash; as long as we pose a threat to the Stellaron, either with words or otherwise, we have a chance at gaining the upper hand.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 firefly 102.ogg}} '''Firefly:''' But the problem is: On the eve of the Charmony Festival opening, how exactly are we going to get close to the theater? Family security will be airtight, and if we brute force it... Even if we succeed, it's too risky.
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... no one's gonna say anything? Then I'll raise my hand &mdash; I know the answer to this question!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You, of all people?
::{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What's that supposed to mean!? You'd better believe it!
::Of course, you do! I never doubted you for a sec.
::{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Express crew would've been disbanded long ago if it weren't for me!
::Looks like we have one more ace up our sleeves. Time for the masterstroke!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, you do! I never doubted you for a sec.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like we have one more ace up our sleeves. Time for the masterstroke!
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why are you speaking like the general of the Luofu?
:{{A|VO chapter3 20 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So, I heard that before the Charmony Festival begins, there will be a pageant to kick off the festival. It's called the... SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions or something, and it's going to be held in the Moment of Scorchsand.

Unfortunately, with the Charmony Festival soon at hand, the theater is temporarily closed down for rehearsals. Just when you thought your plans were thwarted, the wise March 7th proposed an unexpected plan that turned the situation on its head: It turns out that before the Charmony Festival begins, The Family will be opening up the theater to the pre-ceremony warm-up talent competition &mdash; the "SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions!" If you can take first place, you will be able to enter the Grand Theater before the regular audience members.<br />There is no time to lose. You hurry straight to the Moment of Scorchsand to participate in the competition... On the way there, you repeatedly mull over the lesson that this event has taught you: From now on, make sure you have a strategy firmly in place before traveling.}}
