Heeding March 7th's advice, you take advantage of the preliminary contests happening at the SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions, claim the title of champion, and earn the right to enter the Grand Theater early.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue|update|To seal the Stellaron, you decided that you would need to enter the Penacony Grand Theater in advance. Unfortunately, with the Charmony Festival soon at hand, the theater is temporarily closed down for rehearsals. Just when you thought your plans were thwarted, the wise March 7th proposed an unexpected plan that turned the situation on its head: It turns out that before the Charmony Festival begins, The Family will be opening up the theater to the pre-ceremony warm-up talent competition &mdash; the "SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions!" If you can take first place, you will be able to enter the Grand Theater before the regular audience members.<br />There is no time to lose. You hurry straight to the Moment of Scorchsand to participate in the competition... On the way there, you repeatedly mull over the lesson that this event has taught you: From now on, make sure you have a strategy firmly in place before traveling.}}

===Go to the first stage entrance===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue|update|You successfully made it to the SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions in Scorchsand Hall. Those who dream of becoming huge stars gather here and compete in a ferocious competition in hopes of becoming the one and only "Festive Superstar." As the sponsor of the Festivity Auditions, the entire venue is covered in SoulGlad™ memorabilia: Beverage advertisements and billboards litter every square inch of the streets, and buildings and statues in the shape of SoulGlad™ bottles surround you as far as the eye can see.<br />Unfortunately, this is not the time to be having fun and playing games... Steel your nerves, use all your strength, and think of a way to speed around this SoulGlad amusement park!}}
