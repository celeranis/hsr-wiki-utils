{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=(The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand)|The Charmony Festival is about to begin, and you've pretty much completely cleared out the Radiant Feldspar...<br />What, you said you wanted a sense of participation? Well then, there's still a while before the opening ceremony commences. You may as well take a stroll around. Find a seat if you're tired and hold tight for the opening ceremony.}}
