:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 104.ogg}} '''Robin:''' As you all may have noticed, this year's Charmony Festival is far from regular. Thanks to the efforts of everyone, this celebration is unprecedented in scale, with factions from across the cosmos in attendance...

:This "Furmur" doll is a Sparkle lookalike.
:According to the book "Compilation of Sparkle Vocabulary in Modern and Contemporary Times," the term "furmur" was first coined in 2005 AE on the Sparkle Planet in the Sparkle star system. Its original meaning is "fluffy." Nowadays, the inhabitants of Sparkle Planet often use "furmur" specifically to refer to "plush dolls."
:In other words, "furmur doll" translates to "fluffy doll doll doll doll." It may sound peculiar, but considering its Sparkle origin, it actually makes lots of sense.
:The "Furmur" doll is staring right at you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I dismantle your bomb?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stare back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you speak, please!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Continue to stare back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you don't speak, then your silence equates to consent.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Keep staring at it.
:It must be pointed out that this doll has no suspicious features at all. It exudes from within an aura befitting of a "Furmur" doll, not that of an imaginary neutron bomb.
