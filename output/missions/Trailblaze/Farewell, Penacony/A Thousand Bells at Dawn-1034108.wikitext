:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 101.ogg}} '''Robin:''' Distinguished guests, fellow Family members, ladies, gentlemen and friends from all over the cosmos &mdash;
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 102.ogg}} '''Robin:''' It's a pleasure to join you all in celebrating the grandest ceremony of the Amber Era, the Charmony Festival. Firstly, on behalf of the Penacony Family's five major lineages...
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 103.ogg}} '''Robin:''' And on behalf... of myself, I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all our guests!
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 104.ogg}} '''Robin:''' As you all may have noticed, this year's Charmony Festival is far from regular. Thanks to the efforts of everyone, this celebration is unprecedented in scale, with factions from across the cosmos in attendance...
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 105.ogg}} '''Robin:''' Not only that, the customary opening ceremony held at the Penacony Grand Theater has now moved to the Radiant Feldspar &mdash; the very airship you all stand upon.
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 106.ogg}} '''Robin:''' We invite you to express your warmest applause and deepest appreciation for Oti Alfalfa &mdash; head of the Alfalfa Family &mdash; for his selfless devotion to the Harmony's cause!
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 107.ogg}} '''Robin:''' What makes this festival so uniquely significant? As is widely known, the Radiant Feldspar had to halt its voyage due to an anomaly in the sweet dream, sparking widespread discussion in the Twelve Hours...
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 108.ogg}} '''Robin:''' But thanks to the hard work of Penacony's internal and external factions, we've finally gotten the Dreamscape back on track, just in time for the Charmony Festival. And as they say, good things come in pairs. The Charmony Festival not only celebrates this achievement but also marks the relaunch of the Radiant Feldspar.
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 109.ogg}} '''Robin:''' And finally, the last reason. Does everyone remember the Watchmaker? In truth, The Family has poured their efforts into this festival just to commemorate this legendary luminary...
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 110.ogg}} '''Robin:''' The father of Penacony, Mikhail Char Legwork, one of the legendary Nameless who laid the foundations of Penacony!
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 111.ogg}} '''Robin:''' In the most bewildering times of the Planet of Festivities, it was he who descended from the sky with his companions, who taught us through Trailblazing where freedom lies. It was also they who led the vanguard in the pioneering of the Dreamscape, in exchange for what is now known as the paradise of Harmony.
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 112.ogg}} '''Robin:''' It can be said that Penacony's splendid success today is deeply rooted in the Trailblazing ethos the Watchmaker planted within us. Only by honoring this Trailblazing spirit can we fulfill our mission and spread Harmony to a broader audience.
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Aww... That's so nice of her. She's talking about us!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We haven't even been mentioned yet...

:{{A|VO chapter3 30 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Obviously! Wait! Why does that seem so ominous...
:{{A|VO chapter3 30 robin 113.ogg}} '''Robin:''' And now the sweet dream is back on track, all thanks to the Trailblaze, of course. If it weren't for everyone on the Astral Express, we wouldn't be able to successfully host this Charmony Festival.

:This "Furmur" doll is a Sparkle lookalike.
:According to the book "Compilation of Sparkle Vocabulary in Modern and Contemporary Times," the term "furmur" was first coined in 2005 AE on the Sparkle Planet in the Sparkle star system. Its original meaning is "fluffy." Nowadays, the inhabitants of Sparkle Planet often use "furmur" specifically to refer to "plush dolls."
:In other words, "furmur doll" translates to "fluffy doll doll doll doll." It may sound peculiar, but considering its Sparkle origin, it actually makes lots of sense.
