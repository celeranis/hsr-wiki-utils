:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 101.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' When I arrived, I happened to see a child holding it. He said the flowers were prepared by Aunt Jessie, for the Watchmaker, and the war comrade he'd missed his whole life.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 102.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Mikhail would place two bunches of flowers here year after year. And, after he left, it became three.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 103.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Your wishes will always be remembered by someone.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 104.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Now, Penacony as you hoped, has welcomed the dawn after a long, dark night. The path forward may not be a bed of roses, but at least people are prepared to step forth towards freedom.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 105.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Tiernan, you can go home now.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 106.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' While the Nameless are also preparing for the next stop of their voyage.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But before leaving, we still have one last thing to do.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} To say goodbye to you.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 107.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' It is my honor. I've said many goodbyes. Yet I am glad, that this is the first time I speak those words with a smile.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 108.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' But before leaving, I'm sure you all have plenty to say to the Nameless of the past?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've come to say goodbye to Gallagher.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 109.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' Looks like you've also noticed that history fictionologist is nowhere to be found in Penacony, disappearing just as quietly as when he first showed up.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 110.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' I believe he must have come here at the end, to bid farewell to his Nameless friends. Similarly, I'm sure you all have plenty you want to say to them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've come to say goodbye to the old Nameless.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 acheron 111.ogg}} '''Acheron:''' A fitting end to the tale of the departed &mdash; one could not ask for a better farewell. Go on, they're all here.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Honestly, when I heard the conductor's request, I was pretty surprised.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Nameless &mdash; Those who Trailblaze, doing good deeds but never seeking recognition. After all this time, how would we even find those three people in such a vast place like Penacony?
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But it seems... in the Land of the Dreams, anything is indeed possible.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' History may not remember the names of the dead, but the stars will attest to their journeys.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The first glimmer of light in the prolonged night often illuminates little, as it is fleeting and the darkness too vast.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' But because of this, people will remember: As long as something shines in the night sky, then when the first star falls... countless more will follow, streaking across the horizon.

:{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 115.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I can't help but think that whether it's Mr. Mikhail, Mr. Tiernan, or Madam Razalina, their lives must have been long, and they must have experienced plenty of stories...
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 116.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' They were also young once, stumbling and bumbling around just like us, getting into scraps and mischief, that sort of stuff. Companions, enemies, journeys, adventures, all the sad and happy memories... The "every day" that we're used to, they've lived through them too.
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But those things... are all in the past.

::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 120.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's rare that I'm this serious, can't you just humor me for once? Sheesh!
:{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It'll be easier to understand if I use an analogy: Like when you're reading a book, if one of its characters keeps running into obstacles, and experiences an ending full of regrets, we're bound to feel a bit mixed about it, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I could understand, but I'd feel mixed too.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No matter what, that's very hard to accept.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You won't be affected as long as you don't live vicariously through them.
