:{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It'll be easier to understand if I use an analogy: Like when you're reading a book, if one of its characters keeps running into obstacles, and experiences an ending full of regrets, we're bound to feel a bit mixed about it, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I could understand, but I'd feel mixed too.
::{{A|VO chapter3 31 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Because we've seen every nook and cranny of their lives, we see these people as special.
