:{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The Alfalfa Family had a meeting with the IPC?
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I got this information from a message sent by that {{Rubi|IPC ambassador|Aventurine}}. He said it was to "return the favor."
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's not hard to imagine. Penacony today is pretty much like the frontier prison it once was, with external forces casting greedy eyes and the undercurrent of Order lurking within.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Instead of falling into a situation where they are plagued by both external and internal threats, Penacony would rather take a step back and invite the IPC to negotiate at the table, ostensibly to cooperate, but in reality, to secure more opportunities for their own survival.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Well, no wonder they sought the mediation from the Astral Express. In your opinion, who should we stand behind?
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I don't think the followers of the Harmony are completely innocent victims in all of this. For reasons unknown, they have a strong desire to smooth things over, which leads to speculation about their motives.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' If either The Family or IPC were to assume full control of Penacony, it would return to its previous illusory dream of hedonism, and the efforts of those previous Nameless... would once again go to waste.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' There you are. Did you rest well?
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I didn't disturb you since you were in a deep sleep.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It feels like I had a really long dream.
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Even long dreams eventually come to an end. Our adventure in Penacony is reaching its conclusion.
::Where is Himeko?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' She went to negotiate with The Family as a representative of the Crew. She'll contact us once her arrangements are ready.
::Please continue the topic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where is Himeko?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' She went to negotiate with The Family as a representative of the Crew. She'll contact us once her arrangements are ready.
::Please continue the topic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please continue the topic.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' After Ena's dream was shattered, The Family branch from the Montour System soon arrived and swiftly took control of the situation. Most members of the Oak Family fell unconscious, but fortunately, their lives were not in danger.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The mastermind behind the plans was confirmed to be Gopher Wood, the previous Dreammaster, but by the time we arrived... {{Rubi|he|Crows}} was dead already.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And... what about Sunday?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' He'll face a trial. As for further details... The Family would rather not disclose them.
::How did the guests react?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Since The Family branch from the Montour System managed to quash the spread of rumors within a short period of time, the majority of guests were unaware of the situation, and their lives remained largely unaffected.
::What will happen to Penacony?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did the guests react?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Since The Family branch from the Montour System managed to quash the spread of rumors within a short period of time, the majority of guests were unaware of the situation, and their lives remained largely unaffected.
::What will happen to Penacony?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What will happen to Penacony?
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 welt 110.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's what we're about to witness on the Radiant Feldspar.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ultimately, the public perceived the incident as an attack by evil forces targeting the Charmony Festival. They believe The Family failed to safeguard the sweet dream, significantly eroding their credibility in the process.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' While quite different from the truth, this appears to be the outcome with the least impact...
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 101.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' After all, you don't know who's awake and who's pretending to be asleep. While they'll open their eyes in the face of danger, once the danger subsides, they'll embrace the sweet dream again.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 102.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' Here's a toast, with three glasses of "Glory of the Trailblaze" to all of you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello again.
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 103.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' Yeah, it's good to see you all again, although we might be saying goodbye again after this reunion.
::How come you're here too?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How come you're here too?
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 104.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' What are you talking about? This is my lounge.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 105.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' It's good to see you all again, although we might be saying goodbye again after this reunion.
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 106.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' When will the Astral Express leave Penacony?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What happened to Gallagher?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 112.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' I'm not sure. I haven't seen him since our last meeting at the lounge. Come to think of it, he always did come and go quietly.

::Great idea. I'll come back soon.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No need. Let's get started.
:::{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 117.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' Alright, as you wish.
:::{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 118.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' I think I have an idea about what drink to make. Would you like it bitter or sweet? It's up to you. Choose the flavor that suits you best at this moment.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bitter.
::::{{A|VO chapter3 28 siobhan 119.ogg}} '''Siobhan:''' Here's Bitter Dreams... the least popular drink in this bar. It's bitter and sour, just like the harsh realities of life.

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Guess what! Something weird just happened when I was on my way over here. Someone gave me a strange gift.
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So I unwrapped it and found out it was a button, with a message on the back: "Just press this button, and all of Penacony will explode!" Sounds terrifying!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be a terrorist attack!?
:::{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But who would launch such an obvious attack? They just want to stir up chaos.
:::Did you press it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you press it?
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Of course not! Who would press something like that!
::{{A|VO chapter3 28 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' By the time I turned around, the person had already vanished. So I handed it over to a nearby hound. I heard there were many similar reports before the Charmony Festival started.
