{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|You wake up in the dreampool and find yourself back in the real Reverie Hotel. According to March 7th, you really have woken up this time from Ena's Dream &mdash; the Stellaron was sealed while you were out, and all the major lineages, except for the Oak Family, are dealing with the aftermath. She also said that The Family has invited the Crew to The Family's Radiant Feldspar as witnesses for an important meeting.<br />High-end cruise ships, luxury banquets... Now THIS is what a celebration banquet ought to look like. What else are you waiting for? Get ready to set off.}}

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 115.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Phew, after all this craziness, nothing is better than staying safe in reality...
:{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, can we go now? Or is there something else you want to talk about?
;(All choices lead to the following options)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is the "Radiant Feldspar"?
::{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 116.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's a massive airship, and it's awesome! I heard it's never shown to the public. Only VIP guests of The Family get to board it and enjoy the breathtaking views of Penacony.
::{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Iris Family sent us a bunch of souvenirs, fruit baskets, plus this fancy button model. After you're back on your feet, you can enjoy them all... We're pretty much celebrities on the Planet of Festivities now, aren't we?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What happened to you in Ena's dream?
::{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why the sudden interest in that? Well, I was dragged into the sweet dream. I felt a cold tentacle diving into my memories, but something else was there, so the tentacle suddenly disappeared.
::{{A|VO chapter3 26 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' And then, I dreamed about stuffing my face with delicious food and going on a shopping spree... Sunday didn't seriously believe that was the life I wanted, right? Breaking free from that cheesy illusion... was just a piece of cake.
