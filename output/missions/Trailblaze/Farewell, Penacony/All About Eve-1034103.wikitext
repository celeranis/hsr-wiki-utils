{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=(The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand)|For Topaz, the Penacony project was over before it even started. The struggle for Watchmaker's Legacy, Aventurine's memorable demise, Sunday's ambition to become a god... She had brushed up against all of these major events.<br />But now, she had to step forth and complete negotiations with The Family's rep. Topaz had no complaints about this... First of all, she is a professional, and second of all, she loves the feeling of shooting that game-winner.}}
