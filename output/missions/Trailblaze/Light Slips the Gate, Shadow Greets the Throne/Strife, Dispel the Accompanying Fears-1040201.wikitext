|summary       = It's been a long while since Phainon had entered the Vortex of Genesis to challenge the Strife trial. With a sudden incident in the trial, you intervened, saving Phainon from his inner demon. With Phainon's Coreflame trial ending in failure, the responsibility of bearing Nikador's divinity now falls to Chrysos Heir Mydei, the lone crown prince of the Kremnos. Yet even as the true heir to "Strife," Mydei seems to exhibit an odd trepidation and resistance, as if the glory of Kremnos had become his inner demon.
