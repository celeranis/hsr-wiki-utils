With a sudden incident in the trial, you intervened, saving Phainon from his inner demon. With Phainon's Coreflame trial ending in failure, the responsibility of bearing Nikador's divinity now falls to Chrysos Heir Mydei, the lone crown prince of the Kremnos. Yet even as the true heir to "Strife," Mydei seems to exhibit an odd trepidation and resistance, as if the glory of Kremnos had become his inner demon.

:{{A|VO chapter4 11 genaiwusi 128.ogg}} '''Divine Echo:''' "That white-haired warrior knew he was no match for me, yet he chose to fight till his very last breath..."
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 genaiwusi 129.ogg}} '''Divine Echo:''' "What about you, Mydeimos? Can your murderous intent match up to what fate has in store for you!?"
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 genaiwusi 130.ogg}} '''Divine Echo:''' "In the name of fairness, I grant you the blood of Strife!"

:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 177.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Mournful cries... Miserable wails...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 178.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Kings of Kremnos, this is the power you desired?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 179.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' This raging power... I can hardly contain it...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 180.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' How noisy...!
:'''Mydei:''' Barbaric god, I despise you...!
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 182.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Curses! My body feels so heavy...!
:'''Divine Echo:''' "Come, face me! Face the fear that lies in the depths of your heart!"
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 124.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The black tide...
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 mydeimos 118.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' (The person I'm looking for is probably in the hot bath. I should go take a look... The billowing steam always brings back memories of the furnaces in our homeland.)
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 mydeimos 119.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' (Children left unattended by their parents? That's not safe.)
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 mydeimos 134.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' (The future of Kremnos... I should find Krateros.)
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 mydeimos 135.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' (There he is. Is he engaged in a debate with that foolish lion?)
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 kelatelusi 111.ogg}} '''Krateros:''' Keep up with us, you hyen... oh, sorry, I meant officers.

:{{A|VO chapter4 12 shibingQ 103.ogg}} '''Distressed Soldier:''' Calm down, calm down!
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 kelatelusi 112.ogg}} '''Krateros:''' Seems like the son of Gorgo has a poor sense of direction, huh?
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 kelatelusi 113.ogg}} '''Krateros:''' Don't fall behind now... unless you want to upset our friends here.
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 shibingQ 104.ogg}} '''Distressed Soldier:''' D&mdash;Don't you dare try any tricks with us...!
:{{A|VO chapter4 12 kelatelusi 114.ogg}} '''Krateros:''' We're almost there.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 104.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Over here, everyone.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 118.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' That thing ahead...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 122.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' It's the altar of {{Rubi|Talanton|Law Titan}}.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 123.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' But that's not our destination. We're heading to the left.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 119.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' This place used to be passable, huh...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 120.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' I never thought there would be such a hidden space in the Abyss.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 124.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' This is the Archive of Prophecies, an important ceremonial site back then.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 129.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Enough with the talking. Let's just get started!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 129.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Impressive. You too have the makings of a High Priest now.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 130.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Tsk, getting that stone ball to the endpoint looks pretty tough... My hands are shaking just from looking at it.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 131.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' The secret door is open.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 130.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Go inside... and you'll see the place where '''we''' grew up.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 136.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Let's explore the room a bit.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 151.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Let's move on to the bedroom.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 140.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Where... did she go?
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 143.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' It's a secret passage...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 159.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' It was a secret passage prepared by the Holy Maiden's supporters for Mother and me as a precaution...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 160.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' And now, it has turned into '''our''' passage to escape, just as anticipated.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 111.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Time Titan... is that you?
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 magedalaina 101.ogg}} '''Amiable Woman:''' Ah, Lady Maiden!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 148.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Tribios... what does that name actually mean?
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 177.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' "The one with three lives." Mother believed '''our''' birth was blessed by the Three Titans of Fate. She named '''us''' thus to express her gratitude.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 178.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Looking at how things have unfolded, fate might have had a role in it.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 olonyx 108.ogg}} '''Titan's Voice:''' You shall not touch... the Gate of Infinity.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 123.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}, it's you again...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 124.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Ah! That scared me...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 125.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Someone will help me...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 126.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' The passage... is now cleared!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 127.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' I can't move it... Can't climb over it either...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 128.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Thank you, nameless god!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 trinnon 179.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Finally... the {{Rubi|Janus|Passage Titan}} Vault is right ahead.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 132.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' I've come here... to take on your fate.

:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 159.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' O {{Rubi|Janus|Passage Titan}}, please guide my path!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 149.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' We can't just stand by and do nothing &mdash; let's move, partner!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 161.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' The path... is opening up for me.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 shibingO 102.ogg}} '''Holy City Guard:''' You little thief! You're not getting away!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 162.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' O {{Rubi|Janus|Passage Titan}}... protect me.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 phainon 150.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Let's go! Clear the path for her!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 shibingP 102.ogg}} '''Holy City Guard:''' Filthy rat, you'll die for defiling the Coreflame!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 163.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Run! Go faster!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 shibingK 104.ogg}} '''Holy City Guards:''' The Titan is on her side... Watch out!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 shibingN 102.ogg}} '''Holy City Guards:''' Impossible! The gods have long been consumed by madness!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 164.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' The main path is likely well-guarded... What do I do?
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 165.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' Just as I thought... Inside!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 shibingN 103.ogg}} '''Holy City Guards:''' She went that way. / Get her!
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 166.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' There are guards here, too. Don't alert them.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 datibao 167.ogg}} '''Tribios:''' At long last...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 juanshuA 102.ogg}} '''Titankin:''' Found... a rat!
:{{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 101 f.ogg}} A mysterious celestial body entangled by Three Paths appears in the Memokeeper's mirror &mdash; Amphoreus, The Eternal Land, the next stop for the Trailblaze.
:{{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 102 f.ogg}} But the landing is not a smooth one. After surviving the crash, the Trailblaze squad meets the local Chrysos Heir heroes. They learn from them that the Titans supporting the world are rotting away, and that the land of Amphoreus is covered in scars.
:{{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 103 m.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 103 f.ogg}} In Okhema, the final holy city, the two members of the squad undergo great trials and gain the trust of Aglaea, leader of the Chrysos Heirs. Facing a threat from beyond the fog, everyone decides to band together to defeat the Strife Titan Nikador.
:{{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 104 m.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 104 f.ogg}} In order to destroy Nikador's true form, the group plans to infiltrate Castrum Kremnos of the past to discover the truth. At the end of the Abyss of Fate, the Trailblazer communes with the Time Titan Oronyx, and somehow receives a gaze from Fuli.
:{{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w4 v310 review player 105 f.ogg}} With the help of their new friend Mem, everyone pieces together Nikador's divinity and obtains the Titan's Coreflame in the final battle. At last, the young hero Phainon faces his own trial in the holy Vortex of Genesis...
:...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 139.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' And so, this long day passed for Okhema.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 140.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' Some people arrived, and some left forever, just like every other day of this journey where we, stumbling, move forward.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 141.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' We have long been prepared. If we are to chase the flames, then we must grow used to farewells. And yet...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 142.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' No one back then could foresee...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 143.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' "Death"... Its arrival would always be so sudden and so momentous.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 144 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 144 f.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' Even (Trailblazer), coming from beyond the sky, could not escape the Reaper's two hands. And what people gained and lost in that trial of "Death"...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 145.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' Was far heavier than "Life" itself.
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 146.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' Just like the destiny that the prophecy revealed for Cas...
:{{A|VO chapter4 19 tribbie 147.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' "At the end of the sea of flowers, the souls of the living shall warm thy fingertips..."
:'''Aglaea:''' ...
:'''Castorice:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 101.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Aglaea, with all due respect...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 102.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' This trial is taking far too long.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry. Have faith in Phainon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah, he's been gone for a while now...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bah, it feels like we've already waited for forty-two days.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...How did you even arrive at that number?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 aglaea 102.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' What do you think of this, Trinnon?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 101.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' It's not possible to tell for sure what goes on within the Vortex. All I can hear are fragments of speech and distant battle cries...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 aglaea 103.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Is it Phainon's voice?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 102.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' I'm not sure. It's difficult to make out clearly...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 103.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 104.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' ...Ah! Wait, no!
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 castorice 102.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Lady Trinnon?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 105.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' Snowy's voice... I can't hear him anymore...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 trinnon 106.ogg}} '''Trinnon:''' There's a sun-like existence in the trial... It's burning him up...!
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 aglaea 104.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It has come to this, after all...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 103.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' What now?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 aglaea 105.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Get ready, Mydeimos.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's going on?
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 104.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Plan B. We pull him out when something goes wrong.
::We need to stop the trial now.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 105.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Mm. Time for plan B.
::Are you going to leave Phainon to die?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We need to stop the trial now.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 105.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Mm. Time for plan B.
::Are you going to leave Phainon to die?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you going to leave Phainon to die?
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 106.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Why would we? The Coreflame is important to us, but it's beyond absurd to even consider sacrificing him to the Titans.
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 107.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' As I promised you, Aglaea, I will intervene in the trial this time, to bring your Deliverer out to safety...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 108.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' ...But that's as far as I will go.
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 aglaea 106.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Of course. I know this is not the time to demand any more from you.
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 109.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' Hmph, discerning. Alright then, to be as prepared as I can, I hope that the two outlander warriors can also join me.
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 castorice 103.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' That... might not be a good idea. The Coreflame trial is many times more complicated than a standard ritual. Even the slightest misjudgment, misstep, or hiccup could result in grave consequences...
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 castorice 104.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Our two distinguished guests are not obliged to risk their lives for the Flame-Chase Journey. Let me join you instead, Lord Mydei.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's fine. We've got this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Exactly. No way am I getting involved.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' This is a rare opportunity, though... The Coreflame has something to do with the workings of Amphoreus. It's best for us to learn more.
::Can't we all go together?
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 110.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' No, someone should stay outside in case we need help.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't we all go together?
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 mydeimos 110.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' No, someone should stay outside in case we need help.
:{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Things have taken a critical turn, especially so with Phainon's life on the line. Of course, we Nameless will do what is necessary. How should we help?

:{{A|VO chapter4 11 castorice 108.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' That is correct. He was willing to entrust the Coreflame to the Chrysos Heirs... because he was also pinning his hopes on us, to succeed him in shouldering the responsibility of resisting the black tide.

::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 129.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Let's think about the various characteristics of Amphoreus instead. An isolated world of eternal night being eroded by an unknown power...
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 130.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' This has been bothering me for a while now. Everything we have seen thus far suggests that Amphoreus wasn't always isolated from the rest of the universe. Be it the birth of the Titans or the encroaching black tide, none of these can be explained as a "natural progression" of a civilization.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 131.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' There must be other reasons for its current state of isolation. It's just... if the Cancer of All Worlds is truly the culprit, then we should have observed certain phenomena &mdash; explicit or otherwise &mdash; by now, but that isn't the case.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Voice of the Stellaron?
:::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 132.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's what I was thinking too. From past experience, the Stellaron within you should be able to resonate with other Stellarons, but we haven't encountered anything like that here.
:::The Antimatter Legion?
:::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 133.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's what I was thinking too. From past experience, the Destruction has always been involved in some way when it comes to a world corrupted by a Stellaron.
:::The Stellaron Hunters?

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Stellaron Hunters?
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 134.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's what I was thinking too. From past experience, Stellaron Hunters are certain to appear on a world with a Stellaron.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 135.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' There are several other unanswered questions, too. My gut feeling is that things here are not as simple as they seem...
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 136.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Furthermore, what happened in Penacony also proved that the appearance of a world may not necessarily be due to the influence of just one Path.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No sweat! The Trailblaze can tackle even ten Paths if it must!
:::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 137.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' *sigh* It's good to be motivated at least.
:::It could be an all-star cast.
:::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 138.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Heh... In another sense, it's Penacony all over again.
:::Who knows, maybe Akivili's behind it all.

::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 139.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...Not even the History Fictionologists would dare to spin a tale like that.
::{{A|VO chapter4 11 danheng 140.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' For now, let's just take things as they come. The black tide could be a good starting point. Since {{Rubi|Nikador|Strife Titan}} has fallen, those who were suppressed by them will no doubt begin to counterattack now.
