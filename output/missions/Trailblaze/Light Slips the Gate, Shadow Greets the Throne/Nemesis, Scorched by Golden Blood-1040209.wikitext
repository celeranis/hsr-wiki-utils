:{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 113.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' We're back, Aglaea.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 101.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I already know the good news. Tribbie's safe return is proof of that.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 102.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' You should have come to me first, Phainon.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 tribbie 106.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' Agy, there's no need to scold Snowy... Okhema is currently in grave danger.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 103.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I know. It's beyond my imagination that the only two Titans humankind can still rely on fell in such quick succession... I've never seen the golden thread pulled this taut, as if it could snap at any moment.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 104.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Phainon... Tell us your plan. Time is of the essence.
::Phainon recounts Anaxa's discovery...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 tribbie 107.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' This being is not just hunting Titans, but taking the Coreflames, too?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 114.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Yes, just like the Flame-Chase Journey is doing. Professor Anaxa thinks the Flame Reaver's arrival is likely a sign that the black tide has spread further.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 105.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Regardless of whether you're right, this being is still far more aggressive than we expected.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 115.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' But its madness is also an opportunity for us. If its goal is the Coreflame, then that means us humans can lure it into a trap.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 116.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Anaxa had already left the holy city with {{Rubi|Cerces'|Reason Titan}} Coreflame while we were on the way to the Abyss, so he can make preparations for the battlefield.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 106.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Tell me, what makes you think this won't end with us losing another Coreflame?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 117.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Because this time, the power from beyond the sky is also at our side...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 118 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 118 f.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}} is the key.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew it. Of course it's got to be me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? Are you sure I can do it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have a Stellaron. Can we pass it off as a Coreflame?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 119.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' We need your other companion too.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 101.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Oh...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 102.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Do you mean... me?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 107.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I see. Phainon, that "battlefield" you mentioned...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 108.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Is it {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Castrum Kremnos}}?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 120 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 120 f.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Yes. I'm sure everyone remembers the astonishing miracle (Trailblazer) performed with {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion during the battle with {{Rubi|Nikador|Strife Titan}} and how they awakened Castrum Kremnos' past.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 121.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' That will be the key to our victory &mdash; We will use {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}'s power to once again open a passage to the past and lure our enemy inside...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 phainon 122.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Then, we'll "seal" the Flame Reaver in the Maze of Time.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 109.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Impressive. {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} has fallen, and {{Rubi|Janus|Passage Titan}}' divine power already belongs to Okhema. Once we take back the Coreflame, the swordmaster will have no means of escape.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 110.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It's very clever, using the element of surprise instead of brute strength.
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 111.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Can you do it, little one?
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 103.ogg}} '''Mem:''' I just have to throw that black-cloaked guy into the past, and lock them there, right? With the memory fragments, I can open a door no problem. As for the rest...
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 104 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 104 f.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Well, let's just say that (Trailblazer) and I can do anything as long as we're together!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right! We can do anything!
:::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 105.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Yeah! Can you feel their fervent gazes? This is a big deal! We can't let everyone down!
:::Really? I'm not so sure about this...
:::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 106.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Aw, come on! Can't you feel their fervent gazes? This is a big deal! We can't let everyone down!
:::Really? Then I'm gonna make a wish!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? I'm not so sure about this...
:::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 106.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Aw, come on! Can't you feel their fervent gazes? This is a big deal! We can't let everyone down!
:::Really? Then I'm gonna make a wish!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? Then I'm gonna make a wish!
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 mem 107.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Aw, come on! Can't you feel their fervent gazes? This is a big deal! We can't let everyone down!
::{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 112.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Such enthusiasm. I'm glad to see you're confident.

;(Talk to Aglaea)
:{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 126.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Before you step into battle, there's something I wish to ask of you.
:{{A|VO chapter4 17 aglaea 127.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Please, look after Phainon for me. Humans are often so blinded by hate when their enemy is before them, thus have trouble seeing even the heavy weight of destiny.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry. I'll be by his side.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll try, but I don't know if I can stop him...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He can see just fine. I have faith in Phainon.

:{{A|VO chapter4 18 minzhongB 101.ogg}} '''Chattering Citizens:''' But... are the rumors true? Has {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} fallen?
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 minzhongC 101.ogg}} '''Chattering Citizens:''' It's as the Council of Elders said. We face a dangerous threat, yet the Chrysos Heirs are only inciting more chaos. They don't care about the people's safety...
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 minzhongD 101.ogg}} '''Chattering Citizens:''' They really gave the Coreflame of "Strife" to a Kremnoan at the end...
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 mydeimos 101.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' What a noisy crowd...
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 101.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' This... doesn't feel right.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 tribbie 101.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' It's probably because {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} is gone...
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 tribbie 102.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} was a generous Titan in the eyes of the people. They graced us with miracles, allowing humanity to reap many a convenience from the past...
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 102.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' What they don't know is that the Titan didn't do all of that of its own volition.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 103.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Regardless, the Titan has fallen, and we must surrender {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}'s Coreflame.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 anaxa 101.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Heh... a meeting with that woman again so soon? I just can't catch a break.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 104.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Professor Anaxa, why don't you... find someplace to rest first?
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 105.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Matters that require Aglaea's attention are piling up. You two meeting again will &mdash; forgive my honesty &mdash; only distract her.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 106.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Just... try to stay on your best behavior, if you know what I mean.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 anaxa 102.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' That's not up to me, I'm afraid. I've been trapped in her prison the moment I set foot in this holy city. The price of having a Titan living in my head, I suppose.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 anaxa 103.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Don't worry. I don't want trouble either.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He and Aglaea don't get along, huh?
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 107.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' They have... differences in ideology.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 108.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Alright, I suppose that's putting it lightly. Don't worry, you'll figure out the intricacies of these relationships sooner or later.
::That prof's kinda eccentric.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That prof's kinda eccentric.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 109.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Professor Anaxa can be a bit... Unrestrained. Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
:{{A|VO chapter4 18 mydeimos 102.ogg}} '''Mydei:''' I'm sure you don't need my help handling {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}'s Coreflame, so I'll be off. I have some personal matters to attend to.

::{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 114 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 114 f.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' It's incredible to think that we returned {{Rubi|Nikador|Strife Titan}}'s Coreflame not so long ago... It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that (Trailblazer) and your friend's arrival has melted the glaciers of history.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is what Trailblazing is.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where a Nameless goes, trouble follows.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've melted a real glacier before...
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 109.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' You could say this is the true face of history. It slumbered for a thousand years, only to awaken for this one moment. Alas, now is not the time for a study of history.

::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 111.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' A rash decision. After all, he still bears a Coreflame with him.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 112.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I do concur with your assessment of efficiency, though. Now, let us table the issue concerning him for the moment. The more urgent matter is the Coreflame of {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 113.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' The Chrysos Heirs had initially crafted a plan regarding the order to return the Coreflames. For Titans like Oronyx and {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}}, who harbor no intentions of harming humanity, our strategy entailed assuming their divinity only at the very end.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 114.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' But this unforeseen turn of events has thrown everything into disarray.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 tribbie 110.ogg}} '''Tribbie:''' If we don't return the Coreflames to the Vortex of Genesis and we leave the Titans' divine positions vacant... we can't even begin to imagine the disaster that would follow!

::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 115.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Phainon, Castorice, Mydei, and Hyacine... Tribbie and I devoted a millennium scouring the world, only to find these few people.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 116.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Only a chosen few possess the capacity to assume divinity, the elite among the Chrysos Heirs. We would never hastily extend our invitation without first verifying their potential to bear such power.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 aglaea 117.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Yet we cannot compel anyone into divinity, as it would be no different from sentencing them to the gallows.
::{{A|VO chapter4 18 phainon 116.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Truly a dilemma...
