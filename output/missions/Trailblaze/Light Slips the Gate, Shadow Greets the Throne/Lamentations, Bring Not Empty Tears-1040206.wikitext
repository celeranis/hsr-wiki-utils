::Shortly after, in Okhema
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 101.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Phew... That was a close call. Thank goodness that we returned to Okhema unharmed.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okhema, your baseballer is back!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I never want to leave the holy city again.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 trianne 101.ogg}} '''Trianne:''' Ugh... Little Cas, my head... It still hurts.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 trianne 102.ogg}} '''Trianne:''' Sorry... I know you... told me... not to open the gate...
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 102.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Please don't blame yourself, Lady Trianne. If it weren't for you, we would've already met our end at the Grove.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 trianne 103.ogg}} '''Trianne:''' I feel awful... I need to go back... to get some rest...
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 103.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Lady Trianne, you haven't been well since you woke up... Are you sure you can make it back on your own?
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 101.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' All this noise and commotion... Okhema hasn't changed a bit, has it?
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 104.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Are you... Professor Anaxa?
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 102.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' There's no need for doubt. The Titan no longer speaks. It is I, Anaxagoras of the Nousporists.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 105.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' ...Indeed. You are the only one who would refer to yourself like that.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 103.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' ...
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 106.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' ...Professor, let me be frank: The mission Lady Aglaea entrusted us is to search for survivors, uncover the truth about the disaster at the Grove, and... retrieve the Coreflame of {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}}.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 104.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' That does not surprise me. And now, I'm a survivor who witnessed the entirety of the disaster, as well as the defenseless bearer of a Coreflame.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 105.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Are you going to bring me to Aglaea to fulfill your duty?
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 107.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' That is indeed my duty, but I prefer not to present you to her as a captive or spoil of battle.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 106.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Fine. There's no need to make your life difficult. I'm not against meeting that woman.
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 107.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' But I have some things to take care of first. The families of some of my fellow Grove scholars live in the holy city. Before we meet Aglaea... I want to visit them.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you have to do it before meeting Aglaea?
::{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 108.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Because Lady Aglaea... will probably be against it.

:{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 119.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Are you the father of Cynane and Artakama?
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 feibeier 102.ogg}} '''Old Fabio:''' Ah, yes. Did my daughters cause trouble at school again...?
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 feibeier 103.ogg}} '''Old Fabio:''' Alas, forgive this old brain of mine. Both of my daughters graduated long ago, and they are now scholars at the Grove. As I get older, memories from years past tend to blend together.
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 120.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 feibeier 104.ogg}} '''Old Fabio:''' What's the matter, young one? Why so quiet? Did my daughters really get into some trouble?
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 feibeier 105.ogg}} '''Old Fabio:''' If they refuse to apologize, just let me know. Their old dad can still talk some sense into them...
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 114.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' ...What should we do? I really can't tell him...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't ask me. I'm getting all teary-eyed as well...
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 121.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' ...Mr. Fabio, the black tide... took Cynane and Artakama.

:{{A|VO chapter4 14 woman 102.ogg}} '''Woman With Gentle Expression:''' Yes. Oh, are you a messenger? No wonder I haven't heard any news for so long. There's been a change in personnel, hasn't there?
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 anaxa 116.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Ma'am, Callinicus passed away a few days ago defending the Grove against the black tide.

:{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 123.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' The black tide is not just an enemy of Okhema, but all of Amphoreus. Even back when the forces of Strife coveted the holy city, their warriors still undeniably halted the black tide outside Castrum Kremnos.
:{{A|VO chapter4 14 castorice 124.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' {{Rubi|Nikador's|Strife Titan}} Coreflame now sits vacant and the black tide has returned... The Grove is an academic city with the best understanding of the black tide.
