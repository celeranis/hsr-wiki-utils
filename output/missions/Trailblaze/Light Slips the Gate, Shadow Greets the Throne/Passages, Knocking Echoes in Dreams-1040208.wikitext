|summary       = A Kremnoan named Krateros abducted Trinnon in an attempt to undergo the Strife trial, but ultimately failed and was apprehended on the spot by Aglaea. Tribbie and Trinnon, understanding Krateros' impatience, decided to use Oronyx's power to restore Krateros' memories from ages past. Perhaps affected by Krateros' unease, Tribbie experienced a nightmare, recalling her own past once more. Upon waking, the three resolved to venture into the Abyss of Fate to seek Oronyx, only to encounter the Flame Reaver there. At the cost of exhausting her divine power, Trianne sent Tribbie and Trinnon away from the battlefield.
