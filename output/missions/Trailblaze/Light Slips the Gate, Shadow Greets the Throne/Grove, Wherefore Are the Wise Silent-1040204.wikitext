|summary       = Aglaea expressed her gratitude with generous gifts and invited you to form an alliance with Okhema. During the discussion, you met Hyacine of the Twilight Courtyard and, at Aglaea's suggestion, decided to accompany her back to the Grove. Before departing, Hyacine stayed temporarily in Okhema due to the sudden arrival of an unidentified injured individual, while you proceeded to the Grove of Epiphany, only to find it overrun by creations of the black tide. The Grove had fallen. Anaxa, the Chrysos Heir, left clues using alchemy, guiding you to investigate the safety of Cerces' Coreflame. Along the way, you encountered a mysterious figure claiming to be Calypso, who was revealed to be {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}}. The Titan entrusted you to assist them in locating Anaxa to apprehend the culprit behind the Grove's downfall &mdash; the black-robed swordsman without a name.
