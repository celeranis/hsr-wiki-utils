:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We heard about Miss Firefly from Black Swan... But we never expected Miss Robin to...
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I'm sorry... that I couldn't be with you then.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Reality cruises on in serenity, while undercurrents bubble up from the Dreamscape... just like that Memokeeper said...
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Stay strong, everyone. We can still do what we can for them... starting with finding the murderer.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 102 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Let's recap everything then. (Trailblazer) just reminded me of something: March, do you remember what that Family rep who negotiated with us said?
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' "Indeed, we trust that the Nameless has nothing to do with this, and we also beg each of you to help assist The Family in verifying the identity of the deceased." That's how it was put... in reference to Miss Firefly.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Looking back, he seemed a little evasive at the time. And he also failed to mention anything about the earlier murder, too.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Family is planning on covering up all news about Miss Robin's death. If news gets out, Penacony is going to turn into a bloodbath...
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But the murder that followed closely after was obviously beyond their anticipation. The Family had to try and turn things to their advantage by bringing in reinforcements from outside. The Charmony Festival is nearly here &mdash; they must be snowed under.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It may also be that Miss Firefly's murder had so many witnesses that it couldn't be covered up, so they went with the flow and let more people on the scene to control the situation.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' After all, the nature of the two murders is fundamentally different... The Family's first protective measures should be against malicious actors among the guests, such as that IPC envoy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He really is up to no good.
::{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' All the while accusing that Galaxy Ranger...
::Aventurine is on guard against Acheron.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aventurine is on guard against Acheron.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Indeed, he was particularly concerned about that Galaxy Ranger.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Are we missing the forest for the trees here...? I always felt that Aventurine's reasons for accusing Miss Acheron were highly subtle. Can we believe him?
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' At this point, I'm afraid the only ones we can trust are ourselves.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Look, let's try to gather intel first and then list all the possible outcomes we can. Then we go through them, eliminating contradictions one-by-one. The fewer facts remaining, the closer we are to the truth.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...I've still got this sense of foreboding. It's like we're stuck in a whirlpool &mdash; spinning around {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|that Legacy}} even after everything that's happened...
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 9 player 101 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Looks like Aventurine is happy with this outcome... Let's tell everyone about it.)
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' This time we're playing the role of a real detective... But before we start, what are we going to say to The Family and Aventurine?
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' As I see things, The Family harbors no ill-will towards the Astral Express &mdash; if they didn't trust the Crew, they wouldn't have casually commissioned outsiders to investigate a case that's in all likelihood "a scandal."
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 108.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Plus, this is The Family's turf. Teaming up with them should make things easier for us in the future.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 109.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' As for that Aventurine... Welt, I'd like to hear your thoughts.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 108 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 108 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He's complex. He deliberately slow-played his hand during negotiations while running circles round us all the while.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He appealed convincingly to both reason and emotion. It wasn't forced, but the intent was obvious.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 110.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Still, it's good to have contacts among all this uncertainty. Aventurine showed his skills, and as far as our interests are aligned, he can become a reliable ally.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 111.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We also need to keep a certain distance from The Family &mdash; never let them get too close. Teaming up with the IPC helps balance that out &mdash; if either side makes a move, we have the option to pull out.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 110.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' So you suggest accepting Aventurine's proposal to team up?
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes... It's risky, but we can only wait until both sides have played their cards before making any further judgments.
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 9 mar7th 106 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I get why, but there's a whole lot of bad guys and girls around here and I'm worried about getting stabbed in the back. (Trailblazer) has been bullied a few times now, and I can't stand it anymore...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's fine. Let's focus on the big picture for now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's fine. I got a lot out of him, too...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's cool. You can bully me whenever!

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' If Aventurine wants to bring down The Family, he'll have to create a big enough chance. After everything he's done so far &mdash; what is his goal...?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Perhaps he's going for the Hotel?
::{{A|VO chapter3 9 himeko 114.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' An attack on the hotel guests? Unlikely.

Aventurine is a shrewd merchant, and there's no way he doesn't know that.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} No conclusions can be drawn just yet.
