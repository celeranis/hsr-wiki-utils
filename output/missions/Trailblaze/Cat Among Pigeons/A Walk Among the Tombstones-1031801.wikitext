Aventurine, who was long aware of it, crafted an intricate plan and made the decision to manipulate you all to be his executioner while he played puppeteer. Ultimately, your hand was forced, and you confronted Aventurine, an ironic element in his grand scheme:<br />Aventurine orchestrated his own martyr's death, shattering the illusion of promise made by The Family that the safety of the guests was guaranteed. It also uncovered two startling truths &mdash; The Family had intentionally concealed the harrowing dangers of dreams, and Acheron's true identity, as an Emanator of the Nihility.
