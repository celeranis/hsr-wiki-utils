:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:Penacony Grand Theater still silently floats in the heart of the sea of dreams.
:''Odes of Harmony'' plays on, as people continue their journeys, oblivious to the unnoticed corners where two lives have already dissolved into fleeting dreams.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:Clockie's smile forever radiant &mdash; It's not yet known if his gaze can reach every dark corner in the realm of dreams.

:The Central Golden Station teems with a flowing crowd. Like bouncing marbles, the Spheroids securely captures every soul and transports them to dreamscapes afar.
