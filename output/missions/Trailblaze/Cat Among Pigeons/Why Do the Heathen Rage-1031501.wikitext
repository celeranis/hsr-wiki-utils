{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Gallagher gestures for everyone to adjourn the discussion to somewhere else. He brings you to the Dreamjolt Hostelry &mdash; A quiet and ordinary corner in this frolicking dream. Considering the complexity of the cases, he decides to showcase his skills by preparing special drinks to keep everyone entertained. Otherwise, the negotiation process would be too boring. It will be dull if you have to spend the next 20 minutes listening to stories with no gameplay!<br />You can explore the Dreamjolt Hostelry for ingredients. Gallagher will then use magic to make perfect concoctions out of them.}}
