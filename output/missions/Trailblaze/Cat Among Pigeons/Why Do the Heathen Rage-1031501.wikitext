I'm sure you must have noticed that this message didn't come from The Family. You might even have guessed that the relationship between The Family and the Watchmaker isn't as close as it seems?
:{{A|VO chapter3 13 himeko 111.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That's just our speculation. Actually, it's hard to believe that the {{Rubi|Father of Penacony|The Watchmaker}} and its {{Rubi|actual managers|The Family}} are at odds.

:{{A|VO chapter3 13 gallagher 181.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' The prolonged exposure to high concentrations of memoria caused a unique phenomenon. The dreams of countless prisoners intersected and overlapped, and people started meeting each other in their dreams, living lives that were almost identical to reality.
:{{A|VO chapter3 13 gallagher 182.ogg}} '''Gallagher:''' But everything has a price, and sweet dreams are no exception. In the end, the dream world was unable to alleviate the suffering of prisoners in reality. One of the prisoners broke free from the IPC's shackles and fought for freedom...
