{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Although the investigation is heading nowhere, you happen to bump into Topaz and the loyal Bloodhound members who follow her everywhere to keep a close eye on the IPC people. You have read enough detective novels to know that police officers usually have no value except supporting the detective and providing key clues. It's time for them to play their part!}}
