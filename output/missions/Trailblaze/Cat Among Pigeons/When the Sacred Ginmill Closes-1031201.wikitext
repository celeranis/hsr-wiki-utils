{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 101.ogg}} '''Alley:''' Umm, excuse me...
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 102.ogg}} '''Alley:''' I can't seem to find any information on this artist in the Iris Family archives. The photo you provided also doesn't show any matches...
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...Just as I thought. I'd like to ask, what kind of traces do people leave when they enter a dream?
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 103.ogg}} '''Alley:''' Are you referring to the records when you enter the Dreampool? The equipment will monitor physiological indicators such as heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature in real time. This data will be included in statistics and handed over to The Family for the screening of any data anomalies. Immediate action will be taken once any illegal behavior is detected.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it possible to access these records?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Feels like our every move is being watched...
::{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 104.ogg}} '''Alley:''' Please rest assured. Your vitals are monitored in case of emergencies, allowing us to wake you if necessary. This is all for the safety of our guests.
::{{A|VO chapter3 11 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Can I trouble you to access the records?
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 105.ogg}} '''Alley:''' I apologize... The hotel does not have access. This information is managed by the Bloodhound Family. We can only gain access if there's a problem.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Looks like nothing can be found here.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' At least we know who to look for next. We can ask the Bloodhound Family for information.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Thank you for your assistance, Miss Alley. By the way... is Miss Robin doing fine? We are looking forward to her performance.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 alley 106.ogg}} '''Alley:''' "Fine"... What does that mean? Is there something wrong with Miss Robin? The preparations for the Charmony Festival have been proceeding smoothly, so I guess things are pretty good. I believe she will be able to put on a spectacular show for all of you.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Mm, I'm sure.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Sure enough, no one knows about Miss Robin. I'm not surprised.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But that Miss Firefly is truly mysterious. There's no information on her in the hotel system. Even if she's a stowaway... she should have a disguised identity after entering the planet.
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' She's also in the running for the Legacy... How is she going to sneak into the Dreamscape unnoticed?
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Is there any other way to enter a dream besides the hotel room's Dreampool?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Garden of Recollection...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stellaron Hunters...
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 himeko 108.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Memokeepers have abilities that are difficult for normal people to comprehend. In the Memory Zone of Penacony, they thrive effortlessly, a fact proven to us by Black Swan.

;(Talk to Topaz)
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 110.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' How does it feel to be in business with Aventurine? I bet you're not used to it.
::{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 111.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' That's just his style. "All or nothing" is his mantra. He's always cozying up to his clients while egging them on to undertake some dangerous assignment with him... But everyone has their merits, so I won't comment further.
::{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 112.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' But Aventurine's luck has always been good. He's always closed all his cases without a hitch, and basically never lost a gamble. Which is why on the issue of retaking Penacony I'm watching with keen interest.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's that good huh...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It works only when all parties' interests are aligned.
:::{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 113.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Of course. It's business, after all. What's important is where you're seated at the table.
::{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 114.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' As for the two cases... Apologies, but I don't have much info on them either. All I can do is ask you to keep digging for more details.
::{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 11 topaz 115.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Please continue to investigate the case. All I can do is sit tight in the real world. I look forward to hearing your progress.
