===Talk to Aventurine{{subst:void|<!--103090101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|You have witnessed the truth that can "result in the collapse of Penacony" as mentioned by Aventurine... Robin's body starts to disintegrate from the crack in her chest and is eventually reduced to nothingness in the dream.<br />Aventurine seems to have something to say. Let's see what he has got up his sleeves.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Aventurine)
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 101.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' ...Ah, friend. My expression wasn't much better than yours when I first saw this.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 102.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Your eyes aren't deceiving you &mdash; it's her, the famous singer Robin.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But... how is that possible?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could Robin actually...
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 103.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' First of all, can I just say that this had nothing to do with me. I'm just an unlucky bystander here. The Family can testify for me. If you don't believe me, just ask anyone in the Bloodhound Family &mdash; they hate me, and they hate the IPC, so they'd never lie.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 104.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' This is not where the crime happened. What I showed to you was a "memory" &mdash; the most basic Light Cone manifesting tech, authorized by the Garden of Recollection and owned by the IPC.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 105.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Did you really think the Galaxy Ranger was an outsider this whole time?
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 106.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Penacony has made a solemn commitment to protect the safety of anyone inside a Family dream. Any person in distress will be forcibly awakened and safely returned to reality.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 107.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' What gives them the confidence to make such conclusive statements? Because behind this promise is the Harmony: The Family's Dreamweavers link up their minds together to construct an unbreakable defensive line.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 108.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Breaking through this line of defense to create "Death" in the dreamscape... Not even a Memokeeper could do that without The Family's permission.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 109.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Who could have done it? Friend, the only one is her, the girl who calls herself a Galaxy Ranger... An imposter, an unsought guest, an Emanator who hides her true identity...
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 110.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Ifrit's death was a foregone conclusion, and Robin... her misfortune was staring right at her. Who will be the next to die?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This really is... hard to take in.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's just one side of the story.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If that's the case, I can't trust anyone.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 111.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' It's fine. Listen to your gut. Building trust always takes time, and I'm willing to wait.
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 102.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Aventurine is telling the truth. This "memory" is a real one, and there's no sign of any distortion grafting on.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 115.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' The IPC is not the Garden, and there are real limits to what they can actually do. But you know all this.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 116.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Friend, let's not beat around the bush here &mdash; the thing is, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|I want to reach out personally to team up with the Astral Express.}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 117.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' I told you, I'm just not interested in scrambling for "the Legacy." I just came to Penacony for work. I'm here to retrieve some lost property for the IPC, if you catch my drift... I'm talking ownership of this "frontier prison."
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 118.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' This has all become a bad debt thanks to the {{Rubi|Cancer of All Worlds|Stellaron}}. The IPC has tried sitting down for negotiations time and again, but The Family wouldn't even take our calls.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 119.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' You have no idea how difficult these people are to deal with. Put it this way &mdash; they've hushed up the existence of "Death" before, so they can definitely cover up any news about Robin's death.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 120.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' It'll just quietly float off like a bubble and pop, nobody ever being the wiser...
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 121.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' That's not fair, right? So then, friend, I need your help.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of help?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got something on right now.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 122.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' That's fine. I'm not forcing you.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 123.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' But I'm really not asking for much, so why don't you at least hear me out, okay?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't trust you.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 124.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' That's fine. I'm not forcing you.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 125.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' But I'm really not asking for much, so why don't you at least hear me out, okay?
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 126.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' I have but only one goal: The Family's front door is like a high wall, and to tear the whole thing down I'll have to dig out a few chunks first. Once I find a weak point, the IPC will have plenty of means.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 127.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Now we have our chance. So long as we can {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|get to the truth behind her death}}, we can have justice for Robin while also gaining a valuable bargaining chip for bringing The Family to the table.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 128.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Truly a once-in-a-blue-moon opportunity... I've been investigating and making lots of friends all over Penacony precisely for this very moment.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 129.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' This tragic news would be extremely bad for The Family, so they'll be doing everything they can to stop it leaking &mdash; especially to the IPC.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 130.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' But I trust there are still a few factions that remain exceptions, and that's why I need you all. The reputation of the Astral Express precedes you, and the Harmony will give you the fairest of appraisals.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 131.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' You get to find out really what happened and seek justice, and I get to put it toward completing my mission for the IPC... It's what you call a win-win situation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want to take advantage of The Family's trust in us?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Nameless would never associate with the IPC.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A decision like this is way above my pay grade...
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 aventurine 132.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Don't worry. Just head back and talk things over with your companions.
:{{tx}}

;(Talk to Black Swan)
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 106.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' On the surface, this doesn't look like a bad deal for you. But Aventurine is a shrewd merchant whose scheme won't just be as simple as it appears to be.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 107.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' He doesn't know about Miss Firefly yet &mdash; but judging by your reaction, he may have noticed something going on and deliberately shifted topics to the "Truth of Death" to try and pull you in line with his way of thinking.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 108.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' That's quick thinking, and very sound logic. Aventurine is no fool. And working with him definitely has its dangers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Nameless cannot turn a blind eye to evil.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 109.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' But you're talking about REAL evil.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} For Firefly's sake, we must get to the bottom of all this.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 110.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' That... is something I agree on.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Playing it safe seems to be the smarter move.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 111.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Insofar as things are presently concerned, yes. But what about the long-term?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I toss a die to let it decide for me?
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 112.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Leaving it up to fate? It's just how that gambler thinks.
:{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 113.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Anyway, be careful out there. There's more than one way to blaze a trail. In a dark forest beset by wolves ensuring your own escape to safety should be your primary concern.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Did "Death" kill Robin?
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 115.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' I'm not sure the two cases were committed by the same culprit, but that massive wound... looked like its winged blade. We've all witnessed it in action before.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you think this is connected to Acheron?
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 117.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Sorry, I can't answer that question. That ranger is shrouded in mystery. I'm afraid no one is capable of providing an answer.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you noticed anything else unusual?
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 119.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Two victims appearing one after the other in a very short time span... In and of itself, that's very unusual.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have any other questions.
::{{A|VO chapter3 8 blackswan 122.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' It's all happened so quickly I can only make conjecture. After leaving here, go have a chat with your companions. I hope you can clarify the source of this confusion.
::{{tx}}
