{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|You have witnessed the truth that can "result in the collapse of Penacony" as mentioned by Aventurine... Robin's body starts to disintegrate from the crack in her chest and is eventually reduced to nothingness in the dream.<br />Aventurine seems to have something to say. Let's see what he has got up his sleeves.}}

Although he leaves you with enough room to decide, you know that one should not be hasty when it comes to decision-making.<br />You still have the chance to talk to Black Swan and ask for her advice before leaving the Memory Zone.}}
