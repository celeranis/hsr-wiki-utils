Robin's body starts to disintegrate from the crack in her chest and is eventually reduced to nothingness in the dream.<br />Aventurine seems to have something to say. Let's see what he has got up his sleeves.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Using Robin's death as an excuse, Aventurine invites you to collaborate with him in bringing down The Family. It is not coercion, but a temptation with the promise of gain. Although he leaves you with enough room to decide, you know that one should not be hasty when it comes to decision-making.<br />You still have the chance to talk to Black Swan and ask for her advice before leaving the Memory Zone.}}
