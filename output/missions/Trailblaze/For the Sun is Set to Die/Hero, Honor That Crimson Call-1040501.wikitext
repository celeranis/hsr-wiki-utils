|summary       = Upon reuniting with Dan Heng, you received an external communication from Screwllum. At his request, you chose to remain in Amphoreus as an inside agent while Dan Heng returned to the Express. Later, at the Vortex of Genesis, when you and Phainon returned the final Coreflame, instead of triggering "Era Nova," Lygus pulled you into an "Immersive Theater." He revealed "memories" spanning from Phainon's childhood to the conclusion of a Flame-Chase Journey, exposing that the Flame-Chase journey's true purpose is to foster "Destruction," and that Amphoreus, once an experimental ground for the Erudition, has now transformed into the growth medium for Lord Ravager Irontomb, perpetually undergoing the Cycles.
