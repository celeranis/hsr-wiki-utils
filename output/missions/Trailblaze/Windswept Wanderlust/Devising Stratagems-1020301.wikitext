:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 107.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The Astral Express! I must confess that the train's reputation precedes it, such that it is often close to my thoughts. How delightful to come face to face with its passengers!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Frightfully delightful!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Would that this occasion had come sooner!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Are you really a general?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 148.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's an honor to meet you, general. May I ask what the favor you spoke of is?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 108.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Ah, a matter that requires capable people such as yourselves. We captured a member of the Stellaron Hunters a few days ago, who goes by the name of "Blade."
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 109.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' During our investigation, the Divination Commission &mdash; the department in charge of intelligence processing &mdash; intercepted a transmission sent out by his accomplice, Kafka, who has managed to hide aboard the ship. As for where that transmission was destined...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Express.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go on! Where!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 149.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 110.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' I have some knowledge of your relationship with the Stellaron Hunters. The Divination Commission is convinced that you made an alliance with them... I say that's impossible. The crew of the Astral Express are honorable people whose valiant deeds are lauded across the universe. There must have been a misunderstanding.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 111.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' As such, I came to the conclusion that the communication must have been an attempt by the Stellaron Hunters to sow dissent between us.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right! We've been framed!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe the Stellaron Hunters have other motives...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 112.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' We can handle the Stellaron, but it will take time and will require the bulk of the Cloud Knights on the ship. It is this Kafka that concerns me. The longer she stays on the ship, the bigger the threat she will pose.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 113.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Since the Stellaron Hunters lured you to our ship, we shall move with the current. You are hereby authorized to do as you deem fit on the Luofu, with the goal of bringing Kafka out of the shadows and under our control.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 114.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Doing so would clear the misunderstanding between us, reveal the true intentions of the Stellaron Hunters, and help us understand their connection to the Stellaron burst. What say you, my Astral guests?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 150 m.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...(Trailblazer), what do you think?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's move with the current and help out.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 115.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' If you are able to capture this Stellaron Hunter, the Xianzhou will be indebted to you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Our expedition was focused on the Stellaron...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 116.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' I'm afraid my hands are tied on the matter &mdash; this is a diplomatic affair and I have rules to follow. But if you can bring me the Stellaron Hunter and discover her motive for placing a Stellaron on the ship, it would be of great help in resolving the incident.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We don't really have a choice.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 117.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Of course you do. You can be strangers and simply walk away. But I feel you wish to help the Xianzhou.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 118.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The Luofu never fails to reward that which is given.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 151.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Okay.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 119.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Wonderful, it's a deal then. I shall notify Yukong that all intel is to be shared with you, and that our best personnel are to aid you in your search.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 120.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' If there's anything the Sky-Faring Commission or the Cloud Knights can do for you during your stay, don't hesitate to make it known.
:The chat concluded, and Welt shot you a covert gesture. You understand that this is the Crew's own discussion time.

;(Talk to Yukong)
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 yukong 119.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' Seeing as the general gave the order, the Sky-Faring Commission will lend you our full support. The Stellaron Hunter investigation is in your hands now. I'll issue you a pass so you can access the facilities around Starskiff Haven.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 yukong 120.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' As for personnel... the skyports are currently all under maintenance, so we're thinly stretched. What I can do is send Tingyun as your guide &mdash; she'll take care of you during your stay.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 152.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hmm, I think we only scratched the surface of this General Jing Yuan...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you think there's something strange about him?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 153.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I don't know about "strange," but my gut tells me something is off.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 154.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He seems suspicious...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 155.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Oh? Care to elaborate?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why would he stop us from investigating the Stellaron?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 156.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He says he doesn't want outsiders getting involved in the Xianzhou's internal affairs, which is understandable.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 157.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did he ask us to go after Kafka?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 158.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes! There's something about this point...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why is he being so kind to us?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 159.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He wants us to trust him. He took advantage of Yukong's frosty reception to play the good guy.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 160.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought he was on our side?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 161.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Theoretically, yes. But something feels off.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 162.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 163.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Ah, that's it! A minor detail, but curious. He avoided talking about Blade!
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 164.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Since the Cloud Knights have already captured a Stellaron Hunter, why not use him to get to Kafka? Why rely on us?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 165.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Xianzhou is reluctant to involve outsiders in the Stellaron disaster, so why is it so keen on letting us capture a Stellaron Hunter?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could Blade have escaped?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you think Jing Yuan lied about the Stellaron?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's using us as bait...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 166.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes. The only sensible conclusion I can draw is that Blade had already escaped when Jing Yuan spoke to us &mdash; provided they even captured him in the first place.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 167.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Therefore, given our connection to Kafka, we represent the only way of luring the Stellaron Hunters in.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 168.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's why he asked for our help... He didn't want to let anyone else find out that Blade had already escaped!
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 169.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Now that we've figured that out, perhaps we can get closer to the core of what's happening here.

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 166.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We've got a Xianzhou general on our side! This time we have to... wait, does this seem familiar to you? Let's hope he doesn't offer us a hotel!

;(Talk to Jing Yuan's Hologram)
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 121 f.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' I have heard of you, (Trailblazer)... The Alliance is very interested in the Astral Express.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Blade...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 122.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Blade is wanted by both the IPC and the Alliance. I'm afraid I cannot comment on his file.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Kafka...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 123.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' There are five known members of the Stellaron Hunters. Elio is their leader, but always stays behind the scenes. Most of the operations are led by Kafka.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 124.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Had the Divination Commission not intercepted her encrypted transmission, she would have remained undetected for much longer.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Kafka won't say anything.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 126.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Hmm, ordinary means may prove futile when it comes to this individual. But the Divination Commission has ways of...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 127.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' ...Haha, don't misunderstand me. The Xianzhou does not engage in torture. Retrieving intel does not necessarily involve the use of violence.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 128.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' In any case, you can deliver her directly to us. Once we learn something, I will share every piece of information with you.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have any other questions.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 129.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' If things go as planned, I would love to find the time to sit with all of you and hear about your experiences among the stars. My responsibilities to the Xianzhou have meant that I haven't had the chance to travel in many years.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 130.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' We had heard nothing of the Express for a long time. It is heartening to learn of its continued journey along that starward track.
