{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Palace of Astrum|update|In the Palace of Astrum, the hopeful Trailblazers are unfortunately rejected by Yukong.<br />The Stellaron's descent on the Xianzhou involves many secrets, and Yukong does not wish to employ outsiders to solve such problems. Just as you leave empty-handed, General Jing Yuan of Luofu's Cloud Knights appears and intervenes.<br />This smiling general seems to be on your side and opens a convenient door, but he secretly has other ideas in mind.}}
