:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 157.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did he ask us to go after Kafka?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 158.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes! There's something about this point...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why is he being so kind to us?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 159.ogg}} '''Welt:''' He wants us to trust him. He took advantage of Yukong's frosty reception to play the good guy.

:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 165.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Xianzhou is reluctant to involve outsiders in the Stellaron disaster, so why is it so keen on letting us capture a Stellaron Hunter?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could Blade have escaped?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you think Jing Yuan lied about the Stellaron?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's using us as bait...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 166.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes. The only sensible conclusion I can draw is that Blade had already escaped when Jing Yuan spoke to us &mdash; provided they even captured him in the first place.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 167.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Therefore, given our connection to Kafka, we represent the only way of luring the Stellaron Hunters in.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 168.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's why he asked for our help... He didn't want to let anyone else find out that Blade had already escaped!

::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 123.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' There are five known members of the Stellaron Hunters. Elio is their leader, but always stays behind the scenes. Most of the operations are led by Kafka.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 124.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Had the Divination Commission not intercepted her encrypted transmission, she would have remained undetected for much longer.

::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 129.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' If things go as planned, I would love to find the time to sit with all of you and hear about your experiences among the stars. My responsibilities to the Xianzhou have meant that I haven't had the chance to travel in many years.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 jingyuan 130.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' We had heard nothing of the Express for a long time. It is heartening to learn of its continued journey along that starward track.

:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 170.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Jokes aside, did you see Madam Yukong frown at us? I thought her guards were about to jump out of nowhere and throw us in jail.

:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 159.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Don't worry, my lips are sealed~
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 160.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' But as her subordinate, I have to say that it's Madam Yukong's duty to keep her guard up. The Luofu is facing a crisis, and as head of the Sky-Faring Commission, she is responsible for the security of the Xianzhou's customs and borders.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 161.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' She's actually a very reasonable old girl in private.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Old girl?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Reasonable? Are we thinking of the same person?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 162.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' They say that many years ago, Madam Yukong was an ace pilot in the Cloud Knights. She was a "work hard, play harder" type, known for her hot temper and incredible skill.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 163.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Eventually, she became the head of the entire commission, which required her to learn patience and adopt a meticulous approach to her work.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 164.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' In any case, Madam Yukong instructed me to reserve the best rooms at the inn and have all your expenses covered. She wants to extend the full courtesy of the Xianzhou so that all of you enjoy your stay to the fullest~
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 165.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' She specifically mentioned that if you wish to buy anything at the inn, be it food or otherwise, just let the innkeeper know. The commission will cover the cost.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Say thanks to Madam Yukong for us!
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 173.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why don't you go back yourself?
::The commission will cover the cost!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The commission will cover the cost!

:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 175.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ahem! S&mdash;Seeing as our hosts are so thoughtful, I guess we should help ourselves. Right, Mr. Yang?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 172.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We should focus on our objective first. Seeing as Helm Master Yukong was extremely reluctant to get us involved, am I right to speculate that the Sky-Faring Commission has some leads on the whereabouts of Kafka?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 166.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Exactly right. The suspect is extremely cunning. She encrypted her transmission and timed her communication &mdash; we couldn't pinpoint her exact location.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 167.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' But as cunning as she is, the Divination Commission has managed to find something.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 kafka 101.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Here are the coordinates. It's up to you how to proceed.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 kafka 102.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Our destinations may differ, but the orbits of the stars will eventually converge. See you later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there anything special about what she said?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 168.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Don't let her words distract you.
::Coordinates? Converge?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 168.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Don't let her words distract you.

::{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 168.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Don't let her words distract you.

::{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 179.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Still, that doesn't help us much. The ship is huge, with changing conditions across various delves. I'm sure there were showers across many of them at the time.

::{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 181.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' But with the arrival of the Stellaron, things have become messy. Some delves even had their entrance marked as the exit.
