:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do you care so much about this furnace?
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 166.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' It's only a legend... though what with the Ambrosial Arbor having come back to life, I suppose it's no longer absurd...
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 167.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' They say that a long time ago, when the Xianzhou Alliance was adrift in deep space, it encountered many unimaginable life forms.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 168.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' Among them were abominations known as heliobi. They existed in the form of pure energy, but craved the sensations and desires of mortal flesh and blood. Sometimes they managed to infiltrate the delves of the Xianzhou in order to bewitch humans and become parasites in their bodies.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 169.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' It's said that mortals parasitized by heliobi would lose their free will imperceptibly, before gradually going berserk.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 170.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' After a prolonged struggle, the people of the Xianzhou finally managed to trap and seal the heliobi in a vessel.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 171.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' That vessel is the Creation Furnace. Our predecessors hoped that by burning the heliobi in the furnace, their energy would gradually be exhausted until they were completely destroyed.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 172.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' I don't know if there are demons in the furnace &mdash; perhaps it's all just superstition. However, from the day I started learning from my master, I've looked after the operation of the furnace.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 173.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' Indeed, the flame inside has never been extinguished...

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you heard from the Alchemy Commission delve?
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 174.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' Everything happened so quickly. My students and I were caught by surprise.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} According to the general, there are traitors in the Alchemy Commission.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 175.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' I'm not overly surprised. The Alchemy Commission's alchemists were once closer to the Arbor than anyone else on the Luofu.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 177.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' They say that when the Xianzhou Luofu was first granted the Ambrosial Arbor, the alchemists in the Alchemy Commission wielded tremendous influence. Using the power of the Arbor, they transformed mortal bodies, manipulated the weather, and even brought never-before-seen creatures into being.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 178.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' They called themselves "Saints." Unfortunately, they didn't possess any saintly powers. As soon as the Ambrosial Arbor withered, the alchemists lost their status and were reduced to medical researchers and practitioners.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I heard the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus shut down the Alchemy Commission.

::{{A|VO chapter2 5 gongshu 180.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' Agh, I've always hated owing a favor. Take these with you &mdash; rewards for your tireless efforts.
