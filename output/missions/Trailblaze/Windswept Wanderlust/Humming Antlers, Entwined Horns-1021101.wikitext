===Enter the Artisanship Commission to see what is happening{{subst:void|<!--102110111-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Artisanship Commission|The Artisanship Commission is the department responsible for inventions and manufacturing in Xianzhou. People are crowding around its entrance, which is to be expected from individuals when the entire state is in peril. However, it's impossible for you to know what is happening inside without opening the doors to take a look.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Artisanship Commission|update|As the Ambrosial Arbor is reborn, its massive root system spreads outward, roaming everywhere like writhing dragons. Delves situated closer to the Arbor are far more likely to be breached.<br />The roots of the Ambrosial Arbor tightly wrap around a giant furnace in the Artisanship Commission, lifting it off the ground, and the bridge leading to that location has already been destroyed.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Artisanship Commission|update|No one expected an old master to remain at his post in this abandoned delve. His spirits are applaudable.<br />You learn that this man, Master Gongshu, is concerned about the furnace's safety. However, he alone could do little against the rampaging roots. As virtuous and just trailblazers, such a task would be a piece of cake for you!}}
