===Talk with Kafka alone===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|The Matrix of Prescience runs at full power to simulate Kafka's past and unveil her goal, but Fu Xuan receives an unbelievable answer &mdash; The Stellaron Hunters have nothing to do with the Stellaron disaster currently unfolding on the Xianzhou. In fact, the Stellaron Hunters came to save Xianzhou.<br />Shocked, the master diviner hands over Kafka to you as promised. Perhaps Kafka can answer some of your burning questions.}}

===Find Fu Xuan and Jing Yuan and report to them about the Ambrosial Arbor's strange resurrection===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|update|You learn from your conversation with Kafka that the Stellaron Hunters aim to "slay Aeons." Can mortals as powerless as dust harm the gods, which appear as grand as celestial bodies?<br />Kafka does not answer and simply gazes into the distance, as if she had already predicted the current scourge. The divine construct, the Ambrosial Arbor, has been revived in the depths of a distant delve and threatens to pierce the sky after having withered millennia ago. The Stellaron Hunter then departs, leaving you alone in your confusion.}}
