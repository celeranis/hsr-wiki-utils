{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|The Matrix of Prescience runs at full power to simulate Kafka's past and unveil her goal, but Fu Xuan receives an unbelievable answer &mdash; The Stellaron Hunters have nothing to do with the Stellaron disaster currently unfolding on the Xianzhou. In fact, the Stellaron Hunters came to save Xianzhou.<br />Shocked, the master diviner hands over Kafka to you as promised. Perhaps Kafka can answer some of your burning questions.}}

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't act like we're friends.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 104.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Fine, if you prefer. Not friends.
::Are you alright? Are you hurt?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 105.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Concerned about me? I'm fine, the Xianzhou is always courteous with its captives.
::You don't look like you're in a sorry state to me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you alright? Are you hurt?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 105.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Concerned about me? I'm fine, the Xianzhou is always courteous with its captives.
::You don't look like you're in a sorry state to me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't look like you're in a sorry state to me...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 106.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Really? That's good. I wouldn't want to affect your image of me.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 107.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' I didn't talk to you on the train because I knew you and I would get to talk alone here. Worth waiting for, don't you think? You seem to have a lot to ask me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is your objective?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you really innocent?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did Fu Xuan see?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 108.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...Elio said he foresaw three questions, but they would be the same in essence. If I were to hear one of them, I would then tell you the objective of this trip in all its detail.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 109.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Since you asked one of the three questions, it means everything is going smoothly. Are you ready to hear my answer?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 110.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Xianzhou's Stellaron problem is not directly linked to us. But if you look at it from Elio's perspective, you can't say the Stellaron Hunters are completely innocent. We foresaw all this long ago, but chose to remain indifferent until the time was right for us to get involved.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 111.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Diviner Fu was surprised because she discovered three truths: One, the Stellaron Hunters are not enemies of the Xianzhou. You know this now, though you refused to believe it.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 112.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Two, someone else brought the Stellaron into the Xianzhou and activated it &mdash; a result of internal unrest and external aggression. Traitors on the Luofu and enemies from outside want to overthrow the Xianzhou. The master diviner is in a hurry to find the general, presumably to inform him of this fact.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 113.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' However, that's all the master diviner knows, because Elio withheld key pieces of information from me. He foresaw the Divination Commission using the Matrix of Prescience against me. To guard against setbacks, he ensured that I knew only what he wanted the Xianzhou Alliance to know in this moment.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 114.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' As for number three, even in their wildest dreams, the Xianzhou Alliance could never have guessed it, haha... If the Stellaron Hunters aren't the cause of all this, then why are Bladie and I even here?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 115.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...We're here for you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} For... us?
::For... us?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're lying.
::You're lying.
::(Remain Silent)
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 116.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? It's no wonder Fu Xuan doesn't believe it either. But the Matrix of Prescience doesn't lie. The answer is just that bizarre: The Stellaron Hunters appearing here, Bladie getting arrested, me being lured to the Matrix of Prescience... it was all to bring you, the Astral Express crew, to the Xianzhou.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 117.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' In the future that Elio chose, the power of The Hunt is indispensable. That's why the Astral Express crew had to come to the Luofu and achieve something important for the Xianzhou. You had to establish a connection with the Alliance...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 118.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...and that's why I had to trick you into coming here. I needed you to meet the Luofu's general in person and help him resolve the Stellaron crisis. I needed the Alliance to owe you a favor. That way, in the future, at the most critical moment, the Xianzhou will offer you their help.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 119.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' What do you think? Surprised? The notorious Stellaron Hunters did all that just to make you a hero of the Xianzhou... Quite the plot twist, don't you think?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is this future you're talking about?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're lying.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you helping me?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Aren't you happy about the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 134.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' As outsiders, you are unfamiliar with the history of the Xianzhou. I cannot blame you for asking a question like this. Let me tell you a story.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 135.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Long ago, before the Xianzhou took to the skies, our ancestors lived on the surface of a planet. Like all of you, the Xianzhou people at that time were a mortal species with a lifespan of fewer than 100 years.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 136.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' There was a time when the ruling emperor could not bear his temporary existence, or the thought of his life's achievements being lost to another after his death. He became fixated on acquiring an elixir of immortality, and focused his power on constructing a fleet of nine ships. These ships would voyage into deep space, where traces of gods were rumored to exist...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Did he... succeed?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 137.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Yes, and no. He succeeded because, after an arduous journey, the nine ships eventually witnessed the manifestation of a god &mdash; Yaoshi's appearance provided for all manner of unfathomable celestial blessings... However, he failed because the fleet has been lost ever since, and has never been able to return to its home planet.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 mar7th 118.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That doesn't sound so bad. The Xianzhou people went on a great adventure and got what they wanted in the end, right?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 138.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Oh...? Our ancestors once thought so too, but the miracle of longevity was nothing more than a vain dream.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 139.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Take the Luofu, for example &mdash; immortality seemed like a beautiful thing. But what followed was population expansion and diminishing resources. In the struggle for survival, the immortals lost their humanity and degenerated into mere beasts.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 140.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' After paying the price with blood and tears, the Luofu people finally understood that immortality was not a free blessing, but the beginning of a cruel ordeal.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 141.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' In the eras that followed, other beings that had likewise received Yaoshi's blessings repeatedly attacked the Xianzhou in an attempt to take the sacred artifact as their own. Countless atrocities were committed as a result.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 142.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Many Xianzhou comrades who were lucky enough to survive the wars became stricken with mara &mdash; a condition that immortals are susceptible to.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 143.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Had it not been for the enlightenment and protection of the {{Rubi|Reignbow Arbiter|Lan}}, the Xianzhou Alliance you see today would never have existed.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 144.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' At this point in the story, I assume you understand the disasters that the resurrection of the Ambrosial Arbor might bring about?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You said there were traitors inside the Luofu?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 145.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Thousands of years have passed since the Reignbow Arbiter felled the Ambrosial Arbor.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 146.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Most in the Xianzhou regard the Arbor as nothing more than the stump of a dead tree... Only those familiar with our history and the ancient texts know of its origin.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 147.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Our ancestors placed the stump in full view of the people precisely to make it seem unimportant, but in fact, they sealed it behind layers upon layers of delve enchantment. Even if one travels toward the Ambrosial Arbor, one will never reach it.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 148.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Someone brought a Stellaron into the Xianzhou and planted it among the roots of the Ambrosial Arbor. They wish to resurrect it and achieve their hidden goal through external aggression.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 jingyuan 149.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' In my opinion, the force that provided the Stellaron and the force that activated it have different objectives.

:{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 101.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Huh? Look at all the people gathered here... Not a good day for commuting on the Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 102.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' The Artisanship Commission delve should have suspended operations after the Stellaron corrosion began. Why haven't these people taken starskiffs to safety?
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Maybe the Artisanship Commission are just more dedicated to their work? The Divination Commission's diviners aren't exactly a hard act to follow...
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' *sigh* At the end of the day, work is work &mdash; you need it to live. Y'know March, adults forget what "relaxation" means after a certain age, hehe...
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Sounds like you're speaking from experience...
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Just speaking from the heart, that's all.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Path of Trailblaze doesn't seem to allow for any "relaxation" either.
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I think they call that "complaining from the heart."
::{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 103.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Are any of the Paths in this world easy to tread?
::Maybe they're here to welcome us?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe they're here to welcome us?
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 104.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' That's it~! First you arrive out of the blue, then the general recruits you to the cause &mdash; it's like the stories where imperial heroes bring salvation to the world.
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 105.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Still, it doesn't look like they're rolling out the red carpet... We might be getting ahead of ourselves.
:{{A|VO chapter2 5 tingyun 106.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' The Artisanship Commission is full of workshops, buildings, state-of-the-art mechanisms, and craftsmen designing brand-new concepts.

;(Talk to Tingyun)
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 103.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' *sigh* I thought I might be relieved of my guiding duties once the Divination Commission affair was over...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 104.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Who would've thought the general would take such a liking to you? I suppose I must accompany you further... Fate can be so unpredictable.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Through thick and thin, we're like two peas in a dangerous pod.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 105.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' You have quite the sense of humor, benefactors... I've encountered more trouble with you than I have with the merchant fleet in ten years.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 106.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' I just hope everything is smooth-sailing from now on &mdash; please look after me.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} This could be your moment to shine for the Sky-Faring Commission.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 107.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' I understand. The Luofu is in danger, and members of the six commissions should stand united.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 108.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' *sigh* You did save my life at Cloudford... Consider this my returning the favor.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you afraid of the danger, Miss Tingyun?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 109.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' The general said there are traitors aboard the ship.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 110.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' But only someone from the six commissions could bring the Stellaron into the Xianzhou undetected, let alone plant it within the Ambrosial Arbor...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean... the general?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean... the master diviner?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean... Yukong?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 111.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' I am saying nothing of the sort, just raising a doubt, that's all. Please be careful, benefactors...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} If there's nothing else, we should get going.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 tingyun 112.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Y&mdash;You want to leave straight away? Let me pack some things. I'll be right there.

;(Talk to Qingque)
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 101.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Phew, that was scary. I was having a snack in the repository when the Ambrosial Arbor started to grow &mdash; the trunk suddenly shot right up into the sky. So the legends were right all along...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 102.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Such is life, full of surprises. That's why you gotta seize any opportunity to take a break &mdash; who knows when trouble will come knocking at your door.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Given what you just saw, you don't seem rattled at all.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 103.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' It'll be fine. Even if the sky collapses, we have the master diviner with us to hold it up. Oh, and now we have the general here too.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 104.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' What do subordinates like us have to panic about? Let the big shots worry about the big events. That's the secret to happiness.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Didn't the master diviner give you any work to do?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 105.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' She did &mdash; she saw me on her way over. She told me to go to the repository and read up on anything related to the Ambrosial Arbor.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 106.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' A simple task like that is only fifteen minutes' work for me.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 107.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I heard people say even the general has to watch his manners when asking you for help &mdash; pretty impressive! I don't have much to offer you... Uh, here! Take this book. It's the thought that counts!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} We've gotta get going.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 108.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I was gonna wait for the master diviner to get off work so I could show you around and teach Mr. Yang how to play celestial jade.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Your kindness is much appreciated, Miss Qingque. As for celestial jade, we'll have to leave it for next time.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 109.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I know, I know, you've got an important task ahead... sorry to keep you. Priorities are priorities.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 qingque 110.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Well then, get back safely. Remember to come find me in Exalting Sanctum!
:'''Kafka:''' Meanwhile in the Divination Commission...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 123 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 123 f.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...You know, (Trailblazer), even Aeons can be killed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So your plan is... to kill an Aeon?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 124.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Ha, are you kidding? That's not what we want.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 125.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' I just want to tell stories from the past: Stories about Aeons that have fallen.
::Killing an Aeon? Humans don't have that power.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 126.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' That's right, it would be impossible for a human...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 127.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...but then I didn't bring humans into the picture, did I?
::How could an Aeon possibly be killed?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Killing an Aeon? Humans don't have that power.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 126.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' That's right, it would be impossible for a human...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 127.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...but then I didn't bring humans into the picture, did I?
::How could an Aeon possibly be killed?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How could an Aeon possibly be killed?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 128.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Is it so unthinkable? There are many stories about fallen Aeons.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 129.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Long the Permanence, Idrila the Beauty, Ena the Order, Tayzzyronth the Propagation... Akivili the Trailblaze.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 130.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' These names were once known all over the universe. Now, THEY've all but disappeared, leaving behind only masterless Paths.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 131.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Currently, there are three ways an Aeon can perish known to humanity.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 132.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' One: Paths with overlapping concepts will eventually collide, and the broader Path will engulf the narrower one. That's how Ena the Order was assimilated by Xipe the Harmony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 133.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Two: In a war between Aeons, the stronger side will annihilate the weaker one &mdash; that's how Tayzzyronth the Propagation fell. Under the guidance of The Hunt, the Xianzhou Alliance travels the universe exterminating "abominations" cultivated by the Abundance...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 134.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...so the Xianzhou too are engaged in this process.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why does the Xianzhou want to kill the Abundance?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 135.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' As far as I know, the predecessors of the Alliance were the Elixir Seekers. They searched for Yaoshi and longed for the blessing of immortality. When they eventually found the Aeon, they received a blessing that did indeed prevent death &mdash; the Ambrosial Arbor.
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 136.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...But immortality turned out to be a curse for the Xianzhou. That's when The Hunt appeared &mdash; firing an arrow and felling the Ambrosial Arbor. Ever since, the Alliance has followed The Hunt in pursuit of Yaoshi, erasing the curse of immortality from the universe along the way.
::How did Tayzzyronth die?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 137.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' After the disappearance of Long the Permanence, Tayzzyronth divided the Aeon's Path. In the process, Tayzzyronth became a new Aeon known as the Propagation. My understanding is that Tayzzyronth, or "Imperator Insectorum" to some, didn't last long...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 138.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...When the Swarm Disaster began to take hold, Tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple Aeons.
::What about Akivili? Did THEY die at the hands of an Aeon?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did Tayzzyronth die?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 137.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' After the disappearance of Long the Permanence, Tayzzyronth divided the Aeon's Path. In the process, Tayzzyronth became a new Aeon known as the Propagation. My understanding is that Tayzzyronth, or "Imperator Insectorum" to some, didn't last long...
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 138.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...When the Swarm Disaster began to take hold, Tayzzyronth was attacked and killed by multiple Aeons.
::What about Akivili? Did THEY die at the hands of an Aeon?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about Akivili? Did THEY die at the hands of an Aeon?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 139.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' I don't know. Akivili's disappearance was very mysterious. {{Rubi|Nous|Aeon of Erudition}} is probably the only one that can answer that question. After all, {{Rubi|Droidhead|Title of Nous}} knows everything.
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 140 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 140 f.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' What do you think, (Trailblazer)? Fascinating stories, no?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 141.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' They're the kind of stories that folks on the straight and narrow would never tell you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the third way?
::Why are you telling me this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you telling me this?
::Why are you telling me this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you believe all this nonsense?
::Do you believe all this nonsense?
::{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 142.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...Hold on, any minute now.
::{{tx}}
:Do you believe all this nonsense?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 kafka 142.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...Hold on, any minute now.

:{{A|VO chapter2 4 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Did Kafka escape? Argh, how are we gonna explain this to the master diviner!?
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 4 player 101 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' If what she said is true, we won't have to explain anything...
:{{A|VO chapter2 4 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Hey, did she brainwash you!?
