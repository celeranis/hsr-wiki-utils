:{{A|VO chapter2 3 cltE 101.ogg}} '''Player in the South Seat:''' Hurry up, Qingque! We'll be fossils by the time you're finished.
:'''Player in the East Seat:''' The Realm-Keeping Commission made an announcement today &mdash; Starskiff Haven has been closed off and the Cloud Knights are shutting everything down. We need to enjoy our celestial jade-playing days while they last!
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 cltG 101.ogg}} '''Player in the West Seat:''' I heard there was a disaster in the Divination Commission's delve? I'm surprised you're in the mood to play right now, Qingque.
:'''Qingque:''' *yawn* Celestial jade helps train my concentration. Diviners need to be able to focus.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 103.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Even if the sky was gonna collapse on the Divination Commission, the master diviner would be there to hold it up. What she lacks in height, she more than makes up for in stamina.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 104.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Anyway, I didn't come here just to play &mdash; she ordered me to wait here for our guests. Time is precious! I'm simply multitasking.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 139.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's the place in the photo alright. Is this... a games parlor!? What kind of problem can they possibly be facing?
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 105.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Ha! Isn't this hand a problem? I have the worst luck...
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 106.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Hi there! I can tell just by looking at you that you're the Divination Commission's guests.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you bring us here just for this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you even know how long we've been waiting!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't want the master diviner to know you've been slacking off, do you?
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 107.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I know, I know, I'm sorry &mdash; I was going to wait for you by the statue, but&mdash; Ah&mdash; Triplet!

:{{A|VO chapter2 3 tingyun 121.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' It's an ancient tree &mdash; we call it the Ambrosial Arbor. It was once the Xianzhou Luofu's prized treasure.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 115.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I didn't know the Sky-Faring Commission were history buffs! Not bad, younger generations usually don't know much about it. It's said that the Ambrosial Arbor is an ancient remnant from when the Xianzhou roamed the ether.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 116.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' From a distance it looks like half a tree stump, but according to ''Records of the Early Nation'', in its prime, "it wound into the heavens, and from it celestial bodies hung!"
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 143.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Meaning...?
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 welt 125.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It means the tree was as tall as the sky and stars hung from its branches.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 144.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So how big was it? Bigger than the Express? Bigger than Herta space station? No, that can't be right.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 145.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' "Stars hung from its branches..." Then how did it fit in the Xianzhou!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Technically, any tree in the spaceship fits this description.
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 117.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Those are metaphors! You shouldn't take poetry so literally.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It sounds like an unimaginably magnificent tree.
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 118.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Exactly, let's just say it was bigger than your imagination.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 119.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Anyway, it's just a legend. I see this view every day on my way to work &mdash; I'm kinda bored of it.
