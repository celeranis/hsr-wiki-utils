===Investigate the bizarre situation at the Xianzhou port===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Cloudford|Upon arriving at the Xianzhou Luofu, only an empty port welcomes the Express.<br />Kafka claims that a Stellaron had descended here and that the place is on the brink of catastrophe. The closed port in front of you seems to confirm what she said.<br />The Trailblazers will need to investigate carefully to understand what had happened here.}}

===Head to Starskiff Jetty with Tingyun===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Upon arriving at the Xianzhou Luofu, only an empty port welcomes the Express.<br />Perhaps "empty" is not entirely accurate. Soulless mara-struck monsters are running rampant, and a delicate Foxian girl is in danger. How can you let others have the glory of saving a damsel in distress?<br />It seems the only way to get any answers about the cause of the Luofu's chaotic situation is to leave this place with the Foxian girl.}}
