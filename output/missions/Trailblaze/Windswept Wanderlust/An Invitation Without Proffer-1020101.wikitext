;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 101 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Morning, (Trailblazer). You're very punctual.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And a wonderful morning to you, Himeko.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' *sigh* I can't remember the last time I got such a polite response.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Punctual is my middle name.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well hang onto it, it's cute.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm reporting Dan Heng for&mdash;
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Ah, no need to worry, Dan Heng's rarely late. I'm sure he must have a good reason...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Dan Heng's situation is special &mdash; we hope to protect him to the best of our ability.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The trailblazing of Jarilo-VI has drawn to a close, and the Astral Express must depart for the next planet.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's the next planet like?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Not telling yet... We'll make an official announcement in the meeting, but I'm keeping you in suspense for now~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Trailblazing really is a full-time job, huh.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 108.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The universe is boundless, and trailblazing never ends... Even a lifetime isn't enough to explore every world. That's the beauty of the unknown.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Any chance for a little break first?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 109 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 109 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That hardly sounds like you, (Trailblazer). What about that Stellaron inside you? Don't you wanna get rid of it?
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 110.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The meeting will start soon.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 101 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' You're looking well, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You coming with us this time?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Haha, you better believe it. You guys really put on a show for Jarilo-VI &mdash; I'm eager to join in myself.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I gotta say, there were more than a few times where I wanted to lend a hand... but Himeko said I should let you youngsters rise to the trailblazing challenges...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know what our next destination is?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I know alright, but I can't tell you yet. Himeko wants to create a sense of mystery for you and March.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What world do you want to go to?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That I want to go to? ...My home world, I suppose. Sadly, its location doesn't appear on the Express' astral chart records, at least the ones that are undamaged.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' In any case, I do want to see some other civilizations before I go home. It'd be a crime to waste this opportunity on the Express.

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' See, it's like I said: If you wake up and Dan Heng's not around, then you probably won't see him the rest of the day either.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Didn't Himeko say not to worry?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I guess. To be honest, warp navigation meetings are basically just like that "teambuilding" you're always going on about. You don't have to show up, but Himeko might be upset if you don't.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Think about it, Dan Heng's the one managing the archives &mdash; he'll already be clued in to our next destination. Himeko and Welt know already, of course... so it's just me and you in the dark!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dan Heng sure is a mysterious guy.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah... I heard he did something incredible once, and now some powerful force has his name on a wanted list. My guess is the Xianzhou Alliance or the Garden of Recollection. In any case, it can't be the IPC &mdash; I've seen their wanted list.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmm... I bet it is the Garden of Recollection. Didn't it seem like Dan Heng was super keen on talking to Herta? Everyone knows that Herta and the Garden of Recollection don't get along. They say the enemy of your enemy is your friend...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How shocking...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ha! Shocking? I guess you're still new &mdash; you'll find out how strange everyone is around here sooner or later...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What's with the funny look? Am I not strange enough for you? Name me an amnesiac that didn't have some crazy backstory. I already made up a few dozen for myself.

:::{{A|VO chapter2 0 pompom 106.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' A long, long time ago, this train would ferry the Nameless from planet to planet... Now it's able to do the same again.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} When will we get to Pegana?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 0 pompom 107.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Pegana? That's the final stop &mdash; Akivili's home world... Pom-Pom wants to visit again too. Unfortunately, the journey's a lot like life &mdash; you don't always get where you're going right away.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are these destination overviews still useful after a thousand years?

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 kafka 101.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Doesn't concern me. Then again, a Corporation bounty is a compliment, not an insult, don't you think? The higher the figure, the bigger the compliment.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 kafka 102.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' In pursuit of the most dangerous objects in the universe, huh? ...In that sense, you Astral Expressers and I are cut from the same cloth.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 113.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You're in the wrong place, Kafka. We're not about to accept your request, and we're not about to get into bed with a Stellaron Hunter. It was nice talking with you. Perhaps next time you'll be willing to pay us a visit in person and we can continue our little discussion.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...The Xianzhou Luofu? It belongs to the Hexafleet of the Xianzhou Alliance. We've heard of it.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 kafka 104.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Mm. But what you haven't heard is that it's currently very close to you &mdash; a couple of warp jumps away, in fact.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' What exactly are you Stellaron Hunters trying to do...? The Xianzhou Alliance aren't us &mdash; they won't give you time to explain.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 kafka 107.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...It's simple. That Stellaron has nothing to do with us, but the Xianzhou is convinced that we're responsible.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 kafka 108.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' My companion Blade has been taken away by the Cloud Knights. I want to bring him back, resolve this Stellaron crisis, and clear our names.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 116.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Also, we're not your friends. Why should we care if a Stellaron Hunter is innocent, hmm~?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We should seal the Stellaron and help the Xianzhou.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe we can sell our friendship to the Stellaron Hunters.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there anything in this for us?
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No! Why are we listening to her? The Alliance is strong &mdash; is a single Stellaron burst really too much for them to handle? We're the crew of the Astral Express, not some squad of Stellaron-sealing super specialists!

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you allowed to divulge our original destination...?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 137.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I guess it doesn't matter if I tell you now... Our original destination was a place called Penacony. The records on the Express indicate that it's a prison planet used by the IPC to exile criminals &mdash; at least that's how it was in the days of Akivili.

::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 139.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Penacony is holding an event, and The Family sent an invitation to the Express. Himeko intends to accept the invitation, so we were planning to travel there as guests, not Trailblazers.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 pompom 115.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Still, a Trailblazer should choose their goal and the road they take to get there themselves. That's the creed of the great Akivili.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whoa! So that's a Xianzhou ship? It looks even bigger than Jarilo-VI!
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 danheng 113.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' For Xianzhou natives, these ships are their planets.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 danheng 114.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Terrestrial environments are cradles that allow civilizations to survive and then develop. Some of those civilizations progress further &mdash; constructing space-faring vessels which allow them to voyage into the unknown... The Xianzhou Alliance is one such civilization.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 danheng 115.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I've only glimpsed it a few times, but... it's as magnificent as I remember...
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You okay there? What's with all the lonely nostalgia vibes?
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 danheng 116.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 146.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' This is the Astral Express, I repeat, this is the Astral Express. We have arrived in Xianzhou territory. Requesting landing permission from ground control... f&mdash;from the bridge, I mean.

::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* Now you know how I feel when you copy me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like one of those automated customer service numbers...
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 127.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Something's not right.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 147.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The signal is still repeating, but no one is guiding us in to dock.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 134.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Maybe the Stellaron Hunters were telling the truth. It seems like something really did happen to the Xianzhou...
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' A vessel arrives at a deserted spaceport... Isn't that how, like, loads of horror movies start!?

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 149.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The signal broke off, seems that's all there is.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|The Express gallops into the depths of the interstellar sea after bidding farewell to Belobog, where snow had given way to sunshine.<br />The heart of a maiden is as flighty as a spring breeze, easily changing its direction.

:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Before we set off, I need to clarify the aim of this journey with you...
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Stellaron Hunters have given us a lot to consider, and a lot to doubt... But the most important part of this expedition is&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sampling the local delicacies.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 144.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Always thinking with your stomach. What about all the scenic photo opportunities?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Getting to know the people with power.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 145.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That Belobog expedition got in your head, huh...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Stellaron.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 132.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Precisely.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 welt 133.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Stellaron Hunters clearly have ulterior motives. However, knowing what they're all about and given the focus of Kafka's words, I have no doubt that the Xianzhou is dealing with a Stellaron.

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 153.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' This time you'll get the chance to witness Welt in action, haha. I'm glad he's going with you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So Welt's got skills?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 154.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' He doesn't talk much about his past. If you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 155.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...But that's only a small part of his story. Believe me when I say he has more experience than I do.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew there was more to him than meets the eye...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 156.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You could say he keeps his cards close to his chest. If you ask him, he'll just tell you about how he worked in animation...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 155.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...But that's only a small part of his story. Believe me when I say he has more experience than I do.

::{{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 158 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 0 himeko 158 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Haha, much appreciated, (Trailblazer).

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 138.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Allll this universe, and we just happen to bump into a Xianzhou ship that Dan Heng spent time on? That's gotta be fate! I wonder what Dan Heng stories await us.
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 139.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That guy sure has a mysterious past. We gotta take this opportunity on the Luofu to dig into it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Darn straight.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 140.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I knew you'd be excited! Check out the master of gossip over here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Give the man some privacy, please.
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 141.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* Fine, you're right... In that case, we'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That might be dangerous...
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 142.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? Is his past really that dark?
::{{A|VO chapter2 0 mar7th 143.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* Fine, I'll leave him alone then. We'll just have to take loads of selfies till he gets super jealous.

;(Talk to Dan Heng)
:{{A|VO chapter2 0 danheng 118.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You need to take extra care on this expedition. I've compiled some intel on the Xianzhou for you, I hope it comes in useful.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh, Look, it's just containers as far as the eye can see.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' This area isn't for receiving guests, it's for unloading cargo! Who decided to send us this way?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Such a huge port and not a soul in sight. It gives me the creeps...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} At this point, I think it'd be creepier if we did see someone...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yet someone opened the gate for us...
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ah! Stop talking! If there is someone here, they're in my bad books already.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Mr. Yang, what should we do?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We should start with the person who opened the Jade Gate. If it turns out they're not friendly, then at least they've already made things easier for us. If it turns out they were just doing their job, then we can ask them what happened here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're pretty decisive...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's Mr. Yang &mdash; this is child's play for him. He's dealt with all kinds of dangers before.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if they're not friendly and we can't defeat them...?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Are you forgetting we've got Mr. Yang with us? Oh, right, you haven't seen what he can do yet...
