:{{A|VO chapter2 3 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We've heard the term "jade abacus" a few times now. Would you mind explaining what it is, Miss Qingque?
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 141.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' A jade abacus is just... a jade abacus!
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 142.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Eh-he, that's a good question, Mr. Yang &mdash; it might take me a minute to give you an answer. Let me think...
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 143.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' The book ''Glimpses Into the Beyond'' describes it as "living jade engraved with symbols for divination into the unknown."
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 144.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Just like engraving a seal, the craftsmen of the Xianzhou Artisanship Commission carve faint symbols into pieces of jade, and then insert them into machines to get them to operate according to a certain intention.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 145.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Some jade abacuses are small enough to fit inside bracelets and jewelry. We put the bigger ones into instruments of calculation so we can simulate the future and learn from the past.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 146.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Take the Matrix of Prescience here as an example. As long as sufficient information is provided, it can answer questions on anything &mdash; from the evolution of natural phenomena to the metabolism of living things.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 147.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' They say the theory behind the symbols was handed down by Nous, the Wisdomwalker. The principles are so profound that in the Divination Commission only the master diviner truly understands them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So they're computers?
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 157.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Seems like it, but "jade abacus" does sound a lot better.
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 158.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Besides, ordinary computers don't have cool backstories. Technology handed down from Nous, huh...
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 159.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Even in Madam Herta's space station, I never saw anything related to Nous.
::So they're just microchips?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So they're just microchips?
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It sounds like similar technology. Maybe we'll get a better understanding if we see the manufacturing process with our own eyes.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 148.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I'm afraid that's impossible &mdash; the Artisanship Commission's Hall of Jadeology keeps a close watch over the jade carving process.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 qingque 149.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' But if you're interested, there's a shop selling jade abacus jewelry in Starskiff Haven &mdash; I can show you around when I'm free.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 160 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 3 mar7th 160 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Did you hear that, (Trailblazer)? She said she's taking Mr. Yang jewelry shopping. Hehe, that'll be interesting.

;(Talk to Fu Xuan)
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 131.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Qingque, restarting the base terminals will be your responsibility.
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 132.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Oh, and forget everything you saw and heard just now.
:{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 133.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' I will guard the Matrix core. Once we've restarted the three terminals, Kafka's interrogation can commence.
::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 134.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' When we're finished, I'll give you enough time to talk to her.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What happens when you activate the Matrix of Prescience?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 135.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Once activated, the Matrix of Prescience analyzes all the information contained in the target &mdash; Kafka in this case &mdash; and transfers anything pertaining to the Xianzhou into the diviner's consciousness.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 136.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Every one of us walks a Path, moving ceaselessly through time and space, creating all manner of karma in our wake...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 137.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' How are things progressing? I have yet to sense the connection between the three base terminals.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why not use it to calculate the location of the Stellaron?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 138.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Divination is no mere conjecture. If the parameters are insufficient and uncertainty surrounds the target, then it is like looking for a needle in a galaxy. Do you understand?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 139.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Furthermore, interference caused by the Stellaron spirits that infiltrated the Commission has greatly reduced the accuracy of our divination. The margin of error could be as high as 0.2%! I cannot tolerate such inaccuracies in our interpretations.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 140.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' So, have you activated the terminals yet? Why is the Matrix of Prescience still unresponsive?
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What if its calculations are incorrect?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 141.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' There is no "what if"! ...Because nothing remains unforeseen.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 142.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' The Matrix's algorithm is known as "the way of all change" &mdash; it accounts for every unpredictability on the Path of all things with uncountable enumerations. When your objects of measure are eras of time and oceans of stars, there are no true variables in the world.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 3 fuxuan 143.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' ...No more questions! Have you activated the three terminals!?

===Help the Divination Commission to restart the Matrix of Prescience's three base terminals{{subst:void|<!--102080126-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|update|Jing Yuan postulates that ordinary interrogations will not be effective in learning the true motive of the Stellaron Hunters. Such a goal can only be achieved using the computational algorithm named Matrix of Prescience in the Divination Commission, which can examine the past and future and calculate the truth.<br />Now, the three great base terminals of the Matrix of Prescience are once again in motion. All is ready for the "interrogation."}}
