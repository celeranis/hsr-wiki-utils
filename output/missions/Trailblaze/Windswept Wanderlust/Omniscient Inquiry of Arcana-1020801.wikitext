===Enter the Divination Commission===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|update|Led by the messenger, Qingque, you arrive at the Divination Commission, which is responsible for calculation and information management in Xianzhou. The eaves of this building build upon each other like rising mountain peaks and exude an aura of mystique.<br />More mysterious still is the fact that the Commission's doors are shut and show no signs of being prepared for guests, and even Qingque is shut out despite being a staff member.}}

===Go with Qingque to meet Fu Xuan===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|update|Though you are guests, you are now breaking down locks and gates like a group of thieves. However, there is no point in being polite when trouble is at your door.<br />The remaining diviners in the Divination Commission are all worried for their own skins. The variables brought by the Stellaron had far surpassed the limits of the Commission's calculation capacities. Now is the time to ask the master diviner about her plans.}}

===Restart the Temporal Terminal===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Divination Commission|update|Jing Yuan postulates that ordinary interrogations will not be effective in learning the true motive of the Stellaron Hunters. Such a goal can only be achieved using the computational algorithm named Matrix of Prescience in the Divination Commission, which can examine the past and future and calculate the truth.<br />However, the base terminals are currently out of commission and their talismans deactivated. Once again, Jing Yuan employs the stratagem of "Since You Are Here" to ask for your help.}}
