===Head to the Palace of Astrum and meet with Yukong{{subst:void|<!--102030101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Knowing that you came for the Stellaron, Tingyun invites everyone to the Palace of Astrum for a meeting.<br />Six individual commissions oversee the Xianzhou. If you wish to move freely on the Luofu during these sensitive times, you must obtain the approval of the Head of the Sky-Faring Commission, Yukong, who is in charge of transport and diplomacy.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 145.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' On behalf of the Sky-Faring Commission, allow me to welcome you to Starskiff Haven.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 146.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' On the Xianzhou Luofu, anything relating to aviation, navigation, and trade falls within the scope of the Sky-Faring Commission, which is one of the six commissions of the Luofu. As the biggest port on the ship, Starskiff Haven is governed by the Sky-Faring Commission, too.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 138.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You definitely sound like a... what was it again...? Oh, Amicassador! By which I mean &mdash; nice speech.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 147.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' That's too kind of you. My job involves ferrying business delegates to and from Starskiff Haven, so I do this kind of introduction all the time.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 148.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Anyway, we're safe now. Normally I'd be a good host and take you around. But these are difficult times. Let's head to the Palace of Astrum first and report your arrival to Madam Yukong.
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 139.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Palace of Astrum?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 149.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Right there, the tallest building in the city. It's also the headquarters of the Sky-Faring Commission. Let's hurry. We haven't got much time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's the hurry?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We need to take a breather.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can we talk about it first?
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 tingyun 150.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' *sigh* I don't mean to rush you, but if Madam Yukong holds me accountable for not getting you over soon enough, I wouldn't want to be around for the consequences...
:{{tx}}
----
:{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 121.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Little miss fox moves at quite the pace &mdash; I can't keep up with her. *sigh* I've spent too long on the bench... Let's catch our breath for a while &mdash; we can expect a packed schedule ahead.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} That Tingyun is a sly one...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 122.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That might be a little harsh, but she does put her own interests first.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 123.ogg}} '''Welt:''' She did the right thing by not trusting us initially &mdash; we were an unknown quantity to her. As for the rush... my guess is she's just eager to get us out of her hair and further up the chain.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} That Yukong sounds like a tough lady...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 124.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It'll be alright, we're not trying to stand in her way. We have nothing to hide from her.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 141.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We didn't have anything to hide in Belobog, either...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nice! Let's have a look around the city.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 125.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Not so fast...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 126.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I need to give you two a heads up first. Our meeting with Madam Yukong won't be without risk. We need to be prepared and take it seriously.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 142.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' She is a top Xianzhou leader... Mr. Yang, do you think this could be Belobog all over again...?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you saying that... Madam Yukong is the new Madam Cocolia!?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me guess, they're gonna put us up in a hotel first...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 127.ogg}} '''Welt:''' No, the Xianzhou Alliance is better than that. But Madam Yukong will definitely have a string of difficult questions for us...
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 128.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Why did we choose to come to the Xianzhou now? How did we know that the incident is related to a Stellaron? Who leaked their information to us...?
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 129.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Careless answers mean distrust and potential hostility, which would make things much harder for us.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 143 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 143 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Aw, crud. One of us is gonna blurt something out or get something wrong, I just know it...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel offended.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 144.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* See?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Yang should do the talking.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 145.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Good idea! We can be his cheerleaders in the background.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Let's not do that.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Shouldn't we plan out what we want to say?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 146.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh... But we haven't done anything wrong!
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' March is right. If we're too scripted, it'll sound like we're hiding something.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's just be honest with her.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 mar7th 147.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What if she thinks we're with the Stellaron Hunters? Never mind the Alliance, even I don't trust them...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 132 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 132 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' (Trailblazer) is right. If we're too scripted, it'll sound like we're hiding something.
::{{A|VO chapter2 1 welt 133.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Don't worry. We'll find a way through. Let me do the talking.
