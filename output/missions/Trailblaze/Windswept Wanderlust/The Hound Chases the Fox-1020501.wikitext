;(Talk to Tingyun)
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 101.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Oh, you've arrived.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry to keep you waiting.
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 102.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' No, no, only an extra couple of hours~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems like you're not particularly happy to see us.
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 103.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Hee-hee, I like your sense of humor, benefactors. Of course I'm happy to see you! When things settle down, I might even get promoted for catching a Stellaron Hunter.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 104.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Stargazer Navalia is governed by the Artisanship Commission &mdash; it took me a while to sort out our paperwork. I got a sense of the situation on my way back.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 105.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Just like at Cloudford, Stargazer Navalia's meridian pin has malfunctioned. The checkpoint there is abandoned and the garrison is scrambling to locate the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 106.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' With monsters wreaking havoc and the Knights scattered, Stargazer Navalia has become a perfect place for the suspect to hide out.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... we've got a bunch of monsters to deal with, an IPC most-wanted Stellaron Hunter to catch, and we have to do all that on our own without reinforcements... Fair enough, this isn't our first rodeo.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's just what we do every day.
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Haha, that's the trailblazing life for ya.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've caught a Stellaron Hunter before?
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I was just making small talk, never mind the details!
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 107.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' I wouldn't say you're entirely on your own, hehe... When you're ready, let's get going~

:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 114.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' To begin with, let's set him to scent detection mode~
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 115.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Tell Diting to follow the scent of my perfume and see what he can do!

===Use Diting to track down Tingyun{{subst:void|<!--102050106-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|To make searching operations exponentially easier, Tingyun has introduced a handy tool invented by the Artisanship Commission &mdash; Diting, an ingenium dog used for tracking. Getting proficient at using this tool takes some a little bit of practice.}}

:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The traces... where did they go? Is Diting malfunctioning?
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 diting 102.ogg}} '''Diting:''' Woof!
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Got it. He says the wind is too strong here at the port, so it's not easy to follow the scent.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you know what he's saying?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a lot of words for one bark, don't you think?
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's just the psychic bond between cute girls and cute puppies!
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Using the environment to hide her traces... Our girl from the Sky-Faring Commission sure knows how to put up a challenge. Let's look around and see if we can find any other clues.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 113.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Or... we could ask around? Look how busy this place is, someone must have seen Miss Tingyun. That's not cheating, right? We're just collecting intel.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 diting 103.ogg}} '''Diting:''' Woof! Woof!

There, the secret behind the Stellaron Hunter's invitation for you to come aboard the Xianzhou will be revealed.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 118.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Who'd have thought that Stargazer Navalia might become so quiet. "Long were the nights, when the clangor of hammers rose to meet the stars." ...People used to write poems about the shipwrights here.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 119.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' The Luofu relies on the starskiffs produced here to transport people and goods. Now that work in the shipyard has stopped, our internal transport and outbound flights might also grind to a halt.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 120.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' *yawn* Of course, the silver lining is I don't have to go on as many trips anymore.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You don't seem to worry too much about the Xianzhou, Miss Tingyun.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 121.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' I wouldn't say that &mdash; a good businesswoman doesn't wear her heart on her sleeve. Besides, the alliance has weathered plenty of challenges. We can handle this situation.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 122.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Just to warn you, if we do run into Kafka, you'll have to do the fighting, benefactors. I'd love to help, but there's very little I can do except cheer you on from the side lines~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want to leave all the fun to us?
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 123.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Not a lot of people out there could've fought the mara-struck like you did. I'm only a civil servant &mdash; I can't imagine what Kafka would do to me if I were caught in the fray...
::{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 124.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' We foxians don't live as long as the Xianzhou locals, but I still want to enjoy the hundred-odd years I've got left. You'd do the same in my shoes, wouldn't you?
::But Madam Yukong ordered you to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But Madam Yukong ordered you to...
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 125.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' *sigh* Playing the Madam Yukong card, are we? That's not very heroic now, is it.
:{{A|VO chapter2 2 tingyun 126.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Besides, the Madam Helm Master simply asked me to assist you in navigating around Starskiff Haven. It's no different to any other diplomatic mission or delegate reception.
