{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|update|Though the way you entered the dream was less than desirable, Sunday and Robin made sure you received the utmost care... Fine. That was what they should have done anyway.<br />Having refreshed your spirits, you and March 7th received a message recommending you head to the Dreamscape Sales Store... Perhaps you can consider this the first stop on your wondrous dream journey.}}

===Explore as you please{{subst:void|<!--103030107-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|update|Under the guidance of Dr. Edward, you were able to experience the most famous audiovisual feast Penacony had to offer &mdash; a dream bubble &mdash; A virtual-reality device created for the dream world that was more realistic than a purely technological product. You played the role of someone you suspected to be an Aeon named Akivili (or someone), who ended up in a dispute with Pom-Pom, finally earning the title of "Second-most terrible Nameless in the World."<br />It seems that there are many enjoyable experiences like these awaiting you in Penacony. Perhaps you should explore around for yourself.}}
