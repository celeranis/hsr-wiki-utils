But, as you are evacuating, you may be fortunate enough to find some traces left by Firefly that could help unravel the truth behind this sudden demise.<br />You finally reach the area that Black Swan was talking about. From there, the Memokeeper reproduces the memories related to Firefly &mdash; Let's hope that these traces can enlighten your thoughts.}}
