From there, the Memokeeper reproduces the memories related to Firefly &mdash; Let's hope that these traces can enlighten your thoughts.}}

:{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 102.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' When I first saw the Ranger and the Hunter together, my heart skipped a beat... I never thought you'd successfully trigger a conflict between the two.
:{{A|VO chapter3 7 blackswan 101.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' As promised, I've delivered the child to you. Our transaction is complete.

::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 103.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Haha, looks like our Nameless friend over here is still confused. Let me explain.
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 104.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' In short, you need to thank this lady here, my friend. Not only did she not betray you &mdash; on the contrary, she rescued you...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Acheron has her peculiarities, but...
:::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 109.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' But? There's no but. This is the truth.
:::An Emanator? Whose?
:::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 110.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Perhaps The Hunt... or Destruction... or even Finality. It doesn't matter, these Paths all point to the same outcome.
:::Impossible. Why should I believe you?
:::No way. Acheron was right there at the scene. It couldn't have been her.

::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 112.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Let me give you some IPC insider information, my friend. Do you know "Duke Inferno" &mdash; Fetora's Ifrit?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I fought him before.
:::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 113.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Nicely done, as expected! I'll cut to the chase then...
:::Who?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who?
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 114.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' You don't seem to have heard of him before... He belongs to the Annihilation Gang, so I guess it's normal. Then let me explain to you...
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 115.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' This Duke Inferno is a Fire Demon from Fetora. He's an energy lifeform, and it's rumored that his birth is related to a certain genius...
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 116.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' He and his thugs formed "Ever-Flame Mansion" and viewed Nanook as their savior &mdash; in actuality, they were led by this duke to go around burning and looting, practicing the will of Destruction. And even the other Annihilation Gangs weren't spared.
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 117.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' I'm not sure what The Family was thinking, or perhaps someone was scheming behind the scenes, but shockingly these characters received an invitation. And why would the Ever-Flame Mansion decline? They harbor fierce intentions, swearing to turn the Planet of Festivities into a sea of blazing flames...
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 118.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' But there's no need to worry. They won't be able to attend. Do you know why?
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 119.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Because Ifrit is dead.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} As I expected...
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 120.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' They were eliminated while on their way. The assailant, demonstrating remarkable expertise, ruthlessly ended Ifrit and swiped the invite that the Annihilation Gang had in their possession. The Ever-Flame Mansion disbanded, each going their separate ways...
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 121.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' Thereafter, a mysterious Galaxy Ranger arrived on Penacony, checking into the hotel with only a music box... Do you still need me to continue the story, my friend?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was Acheron...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It doesn't rule out others.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any other evidence?
::{{A|VO chapter3 7 aventurine 122.ogg}} '''Aventurine:''' The Galaxy Rangers come and go like shadows, and there's little communication between them. Her story is almost too perfect. If she remains silent, there's no concrete evidence against her. While the IPC can investigate, it'll take some time.
