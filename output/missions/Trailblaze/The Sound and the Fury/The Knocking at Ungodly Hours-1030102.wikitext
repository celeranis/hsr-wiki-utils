===Leave the strange room{{subst:void|<!--103010208-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=A Strange Dream|update|This warp jump is quite unusual. In the blink of an eye, you transition from the comfortable couch of the Parlor Car to an unfamiliar location. A stranger awakens you, claiming that both of you coincidentally share the same dream, and offers to guide you to an exit. <br />Follow her guidance and leave this area.}}
