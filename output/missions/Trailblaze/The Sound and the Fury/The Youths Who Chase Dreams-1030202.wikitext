{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Gallery of Thoughts|Under the guidance of a sweet voice, your thoughts grow clouded and flowing, transcending reality along with the smoke that fills your room, as you arrive in a Dreamscape created from a "Memory Zone." However, the scene you find before you is not a beautiful dream. It seems more like a nightmare. Not only that, but this room has a faint air of déjà vu about it.<br />Have you actually entered Penacony? It seems that you must find a way to make sense of your situation.}}
