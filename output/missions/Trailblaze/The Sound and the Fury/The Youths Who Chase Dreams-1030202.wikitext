===Investigate the unfamiliar room===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|Under the guidance of a sweet voice, your thoughts grow clouded and flowing, transcending reality along with the smoke that fills your room, as you arrive in a Dreamscape created from a "Memory Zone." However, the scene you find before you is not a beautiful dream. It seems more like a nightmare. Not only that, but this room has a faint air of deja vu about it.<br />Have you actually entered Penacony? It seems that you must find a way to make sense of your situation.}}

===Investigate the source of the sound===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Under the guidance of a sweet voice, your thoughts grow clouded and flowing, transcending reality along with the smoke that fills your room, as you arrive in a Dreamscape created from a "Memory Zone." However, the scene you find before you is not a beautiful dream. It seems more like a nightmare. Not only that, but this room has a faint air of deja vu about it.<br />As you investigate, you hear a panicked shout coming from a certain spot in the room... Perhaps you should go and check just who this voice belongs to.}}

===Speak with the hotel bellboy===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As you touch the frame, you are pulled in by an irresistible force, coming to a "World Within the Painting"... No, this is actually just another area of the Dreamscape, a very long corridor.<br />The hotel bellboy Misha is awaiting you here. It seems he wishes to speak with you.}}

===Go to Penacony: The Golden Hour===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Having heard Misha's explanation, you come to understand that the Reverie hotel within the dream is under maintenance and all guests must therefore pass through a temporary transfer station in order to reach Golden Hour. This is the true nature of the room you were just in.<br />Now, you need only touch the other picture frame to finally enter Penacony.}}
