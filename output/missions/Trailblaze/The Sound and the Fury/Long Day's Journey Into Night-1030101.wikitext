:{{A|VO chapter3 0 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Pom-Pom knows how to keep people on the edge of their seats.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So... what came up?
::{{A|VO chapter3 0 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! What was so important?
::It's rare for the conductor to make an announcement.

:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 102.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' I thought everyone knew! Our next destination is the Planet of Festivities, Penacony.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 103.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' I know everyone's eager to disembark and get to that famous stellar hotel, but before we set off, I should remind everyone of three things.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 104.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' First: Penacony is located in Asdana, a star system brimming with memoria, which has historically been one of the Macro Voids that leaked out from the Memory Zone. Even after eons, the memoria concentration up ahead is above normal levels.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 105.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Usually, this wouldn't be a huge problem... but everyone's different, so if you exhibit any signs of dizziness, hallucination, distorted memories or any other symptoms, you should take them seriously!
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 106.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Second: Penacony is a colony belonging to the Harmony Family &mdash; it also marks the first time this Family has extended a public invitation to other factions. Please remember that the Express has been invited as a guest, and that we must adhere to any and all regulations.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Got it! When in Rome, as they say! Don't worry, Conductor, we definitely won't embarrass the Nameless.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 107.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Rome? Anyway... Third and final: Rather than being a request... Pom-Pom has a favor to ask of everyone.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 pompom 108.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' If you could, I hope that while you're all on vacation, you could spare some time to help inquire about a few of the Nameless.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What Nameless?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are we getting new crew mates?
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Allow me to explain.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Just like most of the worlds that the Express calls at, Penacony is one of the stops along the silver tracks. Several millennia ago, it was an IPC frontier prison, and it was the Trailblaze that connected it to thousands of stars.
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' During that time, the Astral Express once visited Penacony. As with all meetings, they inevitably lead to goodbyes. As the Express's logs indicate, it seems some passengers decided to call Penacony their permanent home.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this a rare happening?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who could be this important?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's been so long. Will we still be able to find them?
:{{A|VO chapter3 0 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Don't worry, just think of it as returning to your hometown. Following the Express's departure, the {{Rubi|Stellarons|Cancer of All Worlds}} cut off contact to myriad worlds, and Penacony's ownership switched hands several times.
