{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|A new journey is about to begin. Pom-Pom has stated in the group chat that they want to stress "three things" during this navigation meeting. Given that the conductor rarely leaves people in suspense, perhaps you can mull over what they are thinking and play the role of the stern conductor's straight man for the navigation meeting.<br />Find a suitable place in the Parlor Car to wait for everyone to arrive.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|The navigation meeting has come to an end and the "three things" that Pom-Pom mentioned do not include the Astral Express being able to transform into a giant robot. Though you have to admit this is disappointing, a journey to track a trace of the old Nameless and Penacony itself are enticing enough topics.<br />Before the warp begins, why not discuss your individual plans with everyone? Of course, you could also check in on the newest Interastral Peace Broadcast and see if the Crew can really make the headlines every day.}}
