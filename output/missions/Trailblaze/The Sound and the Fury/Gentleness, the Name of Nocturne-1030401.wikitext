{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Golden Hour|update|As you follow Clockie to the scene of the incident, you realize that it's not only Misha who is under siege but also that Galaxy Ranger who is bad with directions. The situation seems bleak, so Clockie personally bestows you with a special technique: "Clockwork." According to Clockie, it can be used to "fill a person's body with positive emotions." ...Will this really work? You will have to try to find out.}}
