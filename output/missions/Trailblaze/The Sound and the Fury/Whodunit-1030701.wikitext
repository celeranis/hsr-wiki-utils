:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:The remains of this creature bears narrow and deep incisions, with evident traces of charring inflicted by intense burning. A few sparks dance and flicker within, resembling shattered stars departing towards {{Rubi|IX|Aeon of Nihility}}.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:The remains of this creature, pierced by an unknown weapon, reveal inner tissues that have been seemingly evaporated rapidly due to intense heat. You cannot approach any closer &mdash; the steam escaping from the shattered body would undoubtedly scorch you.
:{{A|VO chapter3 5 player 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 5 player 106 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Looks like this monster died of a hyperthermic reaction...)


:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:The surface of this creature's remains appears unremarkable. Yet, as your hand grazes it, the searing heat transferred to your fingertips sends you jolting back, as if struck by an electric shock.
:Without a doubt, a fierce inferno rages within the remains, desperately longing to break free from its confines. For the sake of your safety, it is best to keep your distance.
