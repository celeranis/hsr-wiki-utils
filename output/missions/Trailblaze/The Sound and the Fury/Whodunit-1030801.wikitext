===Interrogate Black Swan{{subst:void|<!--103080101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|As Acheron wages a ferocious battle against the Stellaron Hunter, Black Swan abducts you and takes you before Aventurine. Aventurine expresses his request to you, but you still cannot shake off your shock and the (to an extent) rage at being betrayed.<br />Perhaps you should ask the Memokeeper just what she is planning.}}
