{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|After endless immigration declarations and over a dozen inspections of varying intensity (though it sounds like a quick process, you have been through all of this before and know better), you and March 7th finally arrive at the lobby of the magnificent Reverie hotel.<br />March 7th cannot control her excitement and rushed to the reception desk... You should probably stay close to her.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Sunday and Robin assured the Crew in the name of "The Family"... Honestly, was such a small matter worth all of that fuss?<br />Either way, their pleasant attitudes at least showed that the service in this hotel was a cut above.
