::{{DIcon|Talk}} Aren't dreams fake?
:::{{A|VO chapter3 1 misha 106.ogg}} '''Misha:''' A good question! Maybe not all dreams are false... Well, at least the ones in Penacony aren't. Or perhaps should I say they are... another reality.

:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 119.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You recall correctly, but there was more to this invite.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' "...Witness the impossible in the realm of dreams, find the Legacy of the Watchmaker, Father of Penacony, and thus the answer to the question: Why does life slumber."
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I don't remember that part of the invite... You mean, there was a hidden message?
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 121.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' This is the part that intrigues me &mdash; the invite sent by The Family was nothing more than a music box that, when wound, would play an accompanying tune.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 122.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But the box that was sent to us was slightly unusual... The music it played had off-key notes in the background.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 123.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I recorded these dissonant notes, and they were a perfect match with the gravity wave frequency when the Express made its warp jump. Also, the Express engine's spatial curvature was its encryption key.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 113.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...A distress call method regularly used by the Nameless.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 124.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I can't be certain. It may be a Masked Fool's trap. From the execution itself, the Riddlers or Inquisition Spirits could have done this themselves.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 114.ogg}} '''Welt:''' When did you discover this?
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 125.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' When we were handling that Luofu Stellaron matter. I told Pom-Pom about it first thing.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 115.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's no wonder that IPC ambassador also mentioned this "Watchmaker." The invite he received must also have contained a hidden message, and it seems like he decoded it.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 116.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...There's something else on my mind. When the invite was brought up, that Family leader mentioned being one of the "actual administrators" of Penacony, and that it was their duty to "relieve" us of any problems.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 117.ogg}} '''Welt:''' In hindsight, there was more to that statement. He also had Miss Robin with him... I'm no singer, but her voice sounded a little strange... Would a singer really take to the stage if their voice wasn't in top shape?
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 126.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Are you saying... you suspect that The Family did not send the invite, and... is hiding something from us?
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 118.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's possible. The fact that The Family sent out invites to the other factions is already unusual. And your discovery confirms that there could be a third party involved... I take back what I said: This "event" is becoming more interesting with each passing second.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 119.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Why didn't you tell the others?
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 127.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' We shouldn't interfere if this is just an internal affair of Penacony or The Family.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 120.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But you said so yourself: This could concern the Trailblaze.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 128.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well, I did, which is why...
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 129.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...before we set off, I told March 7th and Dan Heng about this.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 121.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So I was the only one kept in the dark then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I too just found out about the invite thingy...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 mar7th 119.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's because you were zonked out the whole ride. No one had the chance to tell you.
::Time to get involved.
::Ain't no biggie when Galactic Baseballer is in the house!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Time to get involved.
::Time to get involved.
::Ain't no biggie when Galactic Baseballer is in the house!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ain't no biggie when Galactic Baseballer is in the house!
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 122.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Penacony's situation is getting complicated. Let's tread lightly.
:{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 130.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Who sent the invite, what is the purpose of gathering all the factions into Penacony, and why does The Family choose to remain silent about their knowledge of this... There are too many unanswered questions. We must use the utmost caution before we go deeper.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Watchmaker...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 134.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' One can't discuss the Planet of Festivities without mentioning the Watchmaker &mdash; Penacony's household name and figure. Fortune, fame, status... He built everyone's futures with his bare hands, and became the symbol of dreams.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 135.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But the veracity of these stories... remains untraceable. Many have their own opinions on the Watchmaker's origin and past, and there are even some who suspect he is a conceptual construct of The Family.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 136.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' For now, I do not think this invite is linked to the Watchmaker. His legacy... It sounds more like a marketing hook to drum up more traffic, if nothing else.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} About that IPC representative...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 137.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' An IPC ambassador who knows more than he lets on, a silver-tongued businessman, a flamboyant and debonair aristocrat... He could be all of them. My instincts tell me he's much more than meets the eye.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 138.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Before the dust settles, we should maintain amicable relations with all camps, while keeping our guards up.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the dream journey...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 139.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The dream Penacony is divided into twelve individual dreamscapes. I've heard that the destinations vary for different people when they first enter the dream.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 140.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' As for me... I look forward to the Moment of Scorchsand &mdash; its wild winds, taverns, and {{Rubi|festive choices|SoulGlad™ Festivity Auditions • Scorchsand Venue}} have more of a Nameless Trailblaze vibe. The Moment of Morning Dew is also a decent choice &mdash; I can use that chance to visit The Family.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's enough chit-chat for now.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 himeko 141.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You must be exhausted from everything that's happened so far. Even if you're Trailblazing, you mustn't forget to relax. Goodnight, and sweet dreams.

:{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 123.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The decor in here's a little... loud for my tastes. So this is how astral high society does things, huh...?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Watchmaker...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 124.ogg}} '''Welt:''' They say he's a historically important figure in Penacony, and tales of his life have been handed down over generations. Such tales encourage believers to come to the Planet of Festivities to pursue their dreams. He's an interesting fellow, that's for sure, and his legacy still has the power to draw people in.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 125.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But how and why he's involved with that invite, and why his name popped up in the encrypted message allegedly sent by a Nameless... I've got no leads for now.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} About The Family...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 126.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Family believes in the Harmony, and their altruism is well-known across the stars &mdash; a trait that is intimately tied to Penacony's stability and prosperity.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 127.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But some factions have always been wary of The Family &mdash; suspecting that their benevolence and eloquence belie an ulterior motive... So far, it seems to me that The Family treats their guests with courtesy, so I don't think we need to worry about that for now.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the dream journey...
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 128.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The dream Penacony is divided into twelve moments. Personally, I'm interested in the Moment of Sol &mdash; it's a visual dreamscape steeped in Penacony's history and civilization.
::{{A|VO chapter3 1 welt 129.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Penacony's Grand Museum, the Primal Waking Library, the Paperfold academy... The pasts that we chase may be stored in these places.
