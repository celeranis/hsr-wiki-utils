{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|At the critical moment, a Memokeeper named Black Swan pulls you back to reality. She knows that you are in a rush but hopes that you will calm down first and reassure your companions that you are safe... They have been waiting all this time for you to wake from your coma.<br />Although, you can't help but wonder &mdash; why does every visitor in Penacony look so strange?}}

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...How do you see things, Himeko?
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 himeko 110.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's best to be skeptical of her. There's a significant amount of intentional misdirection in her words.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 himeko 111.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But I worry about the worst outcome: If the Dreamscape's anomaly really exists, and it isn't a natural occurrence, but instigated by someone behind the scenes...
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Then it likely has something to do with the Watchmaker's invite.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh, how'd you figure that one out?
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 110.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Well, excluding any extreme scenarios, the mastermind responsible for these shifts in the dreamscape undeniably stands against The Family, which narrows it down to two possibilities...
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 111.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Someone is drawing in external influences to distract and disrupt The Family's control over Penacony. Either that, or The Family has been forced to seek outside aid surreptitiously for self-preservation.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But from the encrypted message on the invite, and The Family's reaction... The former is more likely.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 himeko 112.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Which also means that, the one who sent out the encrypted Nameless message and the mastermind behind the anomaly are on the same side... Maybe even the same person.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well... this doesn't necessarily mean a thing, right? In terms of methods, both the Fools and the Riddlers could pull it off. Hasn't the IPC cracked the message, too?
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 himeko 113.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' March, calm down. It's just a possibility. But if this encrypted message isn't some harmless prank, but done so to invite the Trailblaze into the fray, we cannot remain uninvolved.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 113.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Well, let me tell you what I discovered, and I'm sorry &mdash; it's bad news.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 114.ogg}} '''Welt:''' According to reliable sources, some people spotted a tall silver-armored man on Penacony. I've reached out to the Bloodhound Family for news, and visited many of those guests who claimed to have seen this invader...
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 115 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 115 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...And this is what I received. (Trailblazer), I've sent it to you. Open it and take a look.
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Those Stellaron Hunters... They even factored Penacony into their plan! Nowhere's safe from them!
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 116.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The situation is clear &mdash; the Planet of Festivities isn't what it seems on the surface. Everyone's sights, including the factions in The Family, are set on the Watchmaker's Legacy. Every party has its own motives, and they're attempting to thwart each other.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 117.ogg}} '''Welt:''' While we still don't know what this legacy entails, it's only a matter of time before the power struggle ensnares innocent bystanders.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 118.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Molten Knight, Sam, is reportedly a remnant of Glamoth's Iron Cavalry &mdash; a genetically engineered warrior. He possesses superhuman perception and acts decisively &mdash; he'll leave no margin for error. This individual is every bit as dangerous as Kafka and Blade.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 119.ogg}} '''Welt:''' This message is a threat. The hidden map that Silver Wolf mentioned is probably the sealed dreamscape Hotel. For the sake of what's to come, a visit seems necessary.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we inform The Family?
::{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 120.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We may be on amicable terms, but that doesn't mean they trust us... Let's act first and talk later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if we get found out...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It could be a Stellaron Hunter's trap...
::{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 121.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Which is why I didn't suggest it initially. But the way things are now, the Astral Express has a reason to join the fray.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 welt 122.ogg}} '''Welt:''' If The Family asks, just tell them that the Express is investigating the Stellaron Hunters &mdash; I'm sure they'll understand. We'll plan our next move according to how they react.
:{{A|VO chapter3 4 himeko 114.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Then we are in agreement. Let's return and inform Miss Black Swan.
