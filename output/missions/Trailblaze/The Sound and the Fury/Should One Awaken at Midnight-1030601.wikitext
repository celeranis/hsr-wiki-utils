===Assemble with the Crew{{subst:void|<!--103060101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|At the critical moment, a Memokeeper named Black Swan pulls you back to reality. She knows that you are in a rush but hopes that you will calm down first and reassure your companions that you are safe... They have been waiting all this time for you to wake from your coma.<br />Although, you can't help but wonder &mdash; why does every visitor in Penacony look so strange?}}

===Talk to Acheron{{subst:void|<!--103060133-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Firefly has been taken by "death." She was a gentle and brave girl... Perhaps you should join the Ranger in mourning her.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Speak with the Express Crew and discuss Black Swan's suggestion{{subst:void|<!--103060121-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|The reunion with the Crew is indeed not as harmonious as you expected. She comes to you with a condition: She will save your life in return for the Crew's collaboration.<br />Everyone says that the Memokeepers of the Garden of Recollection are the most fearsome... You should discuss your decision carefully before giving her an answer.}}

===Speak with Black Swan and give her an answer{{subst:void|<!--103060132-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|After considering every factor, you have decided to cooperate with this Memokeeper.<br />Now, it is time to give her the conclusion that you have reached.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Enter the Dreampool{{subst:void|<!--103060102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|Although the negotiation process was a little uncertain at times, at least everyone is happy with the results. With Black Swan's company, you should be able to avoid any danger in the "real Memory Zone."<br />Enter the code that Silver Wolf gave you into the Dreampool and prepare to witness the true nature of the Dreamscape.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Speak with Black Swan{{subst:void|<!--103060104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|With Silver Wolf's assistance, you successfully arrived at the true Dreamscape &mdash; This place seems almost identical to what you have already experienced in your dreams... Perhaps you've even grown tired of this. Not to worry. Black Swan will serve as your guide here and take you on a relaxing and enjoyable Memory Zone adventure &mdash;<br />&mdash;If only that is the case. Either way, you must meet with her.}}

===Try to wake up March 7th{{subst:void|<!--103060105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Black Swan leads you forward in the Memory Zone. For safety's sake, maybe you should consider waking up March 7th to travel with you.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to the Lobby in the Dreamscape{{subst:void|<!--103060106-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Having learned of how your companions have become scattered, Black Swan continues to lead you forward in the Memory Zone. If everyone is able to protect themselves, then you should be able to meet up again in the dream hotel lobby.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Find the path to the Lobby{{subst:void|<!--103060108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|Having learned of how your companions have become scattered, Black Swan continues to lead you forward in the Memory Zone. Along the way, you unexpectedly encounter the Galaxy Ranger, who is here searching for secrets (though she gave sufficient reasons for her to be here, you have reasons to suspect that she just got lost again.)<br />Now, with the assistance of this Ranger, it should be no trouble for you all to make it to the hotel lobby &mdash; However, Black Swan seems a little apprehensive of her... Why could this be?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Enter the suspicious elevator{{subst:void|<!--103060113-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|You are just a step away from the place you arranged to meet, but a suspicious elevator blocks your path.<br />Black Swan says that the road ahead "seems to have been heavily distorted" &mdash; But what could possibly have happened in there? It seems you may have no choice but to enter the elevator to find your answer.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Leave this place and continue towards the Lobby{{subst:void|<!--103060114-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|It seems that Black Swan's premonition was entirely correct. You've arrived in a severely distorted space &mdash;fortunately, there is a door here. If everything goes as expected, this door should be the exit from this space (though your adventure has been constantly plagued by the unexpected).<br />Perhaps you should open the door and leave this place immediately instead of continuing to run in circles in this tiny room.}}

===Investigate the Dream Jigsaw that had mysteriously appeared{{subst:void|<!--103060117-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Reverie (Dreamscape)|update|The Dreamweaver Gentleman can be seen all over Penacony, yet he has appeared before you precisely at this moment again to give you a completely unnecessary puzzle.<br />Complete this puzzle and leave this distorted Memory Zone.}}

===Investigate the Lobby{{subst:void|<!--103060128-->}}===
