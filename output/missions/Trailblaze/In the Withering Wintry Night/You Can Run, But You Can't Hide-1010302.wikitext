===Eliminate the monster and activate the switch===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Backwater Pass|You rush into the Fragmentum to avoid getting caught. How come things went downhill so quickly? March 7th has no clue &mdash; she's written as an innocent and sweet teenage girl after all.<br />Despite the initial shock, you quickly agree on the course of action: Find the way out of the Fragmentum first. Everything else can wait.<br />Being blocked by a second gate while trying to escape is so cliche... However, there are monsters wandering around the gate switch this time.<br />Defeat the monsters and clear the stage!}}
