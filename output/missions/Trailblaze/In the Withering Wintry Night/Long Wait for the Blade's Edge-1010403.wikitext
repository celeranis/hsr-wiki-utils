{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|You have to give credit to Sampo &mdash; no one can be quite the con man as he is. If it weren't for Dan Heng, the three of you would fall for Sampo's silver tongue again.<br />Sampo finally agrees to introduce all of you to Wildfire, thanks to Dan Heng's... persuasion.<br />You have no clue what Wildfire is up to, but judging from word on the street, you have a feeling that Wildfire may have leads on the Stellaron...}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 2 sampo 232.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Ah, this is Geomarrow, an exothermic ore. The underground and the surface are sealed off from one another, right? Well only the Geomarrow transport line is still running. The underground sends ore to the surface, and the surface sends goods to the underground. At least in theory.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 sampo 233.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Most undergrounders are miners, and this is what they mine for a living. Y'know, if we didn't have Geomarrow to burn, this world would have frozen to death long ago.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You didn't answer the question.

;(Talk to Dan Heng)
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 210.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' How are you finding your first Trailblazing expedition?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pretty great, I enjoy a good adventure!
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 211.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...That's good.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel a bit discombobulated.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 212.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' All journeys contain their share of the unexpected. It won't be the last time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Trailblazing expedition? Pretty unremarkable.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 213.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...Sounds like you've taken it in your stride.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 214.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I'm about to summarize the intel we've gathered so far. Did you want to listen?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's why I'm here.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 216.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' First we have the Underworld &mdash; a huge underground space. Miners have built towns here and are excavating Geomarrow.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What's the relation between here and the Overworld?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 217.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' We learned from Natasha that the Underworld shoulders the energy needs of their entire civilization. Laboring in the Underworld used to be a great honor, and there was regular movement between realms.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 218.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Sampo mentioned the Furnace Core, which people would use to travel in both directions. Yet now, each realm is sealed off from the other. Only the automatic transport line for Geomarrow and goods is still in operation.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 219.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The reason for sealing the Furnace Core still needs to be investigated. In addition, it appears that Sampo has secret connections that grant him passage between here and the surface. That may come in useful to us.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Do soldiers from the Overworld ever come down here?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 220.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Up to now, apart from Bronya, whom Sampo brought here, I still haven't seen a single Silvermane Guard.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 221.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' At the Fight Club I heard people say that the Guards withdrew from the underground many years ago, and that it was the supreme guardian who gave the order.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 222.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' At the time, the supreme guardian was none other than Cocolia Rand.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm clear on this bit. What else?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 224.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Next we have our goal &mdash; the Stellaron.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 225.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' After we revealed our intentions, the supreme guardian suspended communications and sent soldiers to arrest us. Her reaction was strange, to say the least.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why did the supreme guardian choose to act that way?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 226.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It's too early to say, but it was a radical move. It means that we must have broached a highly sensitive subject... a secret that she's sparing no effort to protect.
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 227.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' If I remember our discussion correctly, I think there are two main possibilities: The Architects, and the Stellaron. I'm inclined to think it's the latter, but we lack evidence.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Will we find any Stellaron clues in the Underworld?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 danheng 228.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' There's an old saying that goes: "Good fortune lies within bad, bad fortune lurks within good." Even when compared with the Overworld, the Underworld has a long history. There should be valuable intel here. Not to mention, without the supreme guardian's interference, we have a better chance than ever of locating the Stellaron.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} Uhh, maybe next time.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 278.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Where should I start?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} I want to hear about your observations....
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 279.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ha, my observational skills are second to none.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How about the Underworld geography?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 280.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, the Underworld is surrounded by cliffs, and there's no obvious structure. It seems like a spread out collection of mines and small towns &mdash; just like the outskirts of Belobog.
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 281.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' There's that huge pillar called the Furnace Core that's always in view &mdash; maybe it's some kind of energy hub?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How about Underworld life?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 282.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' From what I've seen, the residents are nearly all miners. It seems like the people here have less than those in the Overworld.
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 283.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Still, the miners watch fights in their spare time. It's less pretentious than that theater they have on the surface.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How about the Underworlders?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 284.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' They're always in a hurry. The pace of life here is so fast! Things are pretty busy in the Overworld too, but everything feels more relaxed up there.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Sampo?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 286.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That guy!? He's lazy, lying, cunning, and evil! I don't like him &mdash; can't stand the sight of him.
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 287.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I bet you think he's pretty entertaining. Watch out, or he'll fool you!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Hook?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 288.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ah, you mean that naughty kid we played hide-and-seek with?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 289.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Dr. Natasha said that she's a handful, but that she also takes care of the homeless kids. Maybe she's more mature than she seems?
::::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 290.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Still, I can't believe how arrogant she is. I was pretty mad with her for a while.

::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 208.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...There's... something wrong with you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 209.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...I saw you the day before the Goethe Hotel. Gepard took you to see mo&mdash; ...the supreme guardian. He told me you were visitors from beyond the sky.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 210.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Just like the interstellar travelers of ancient legend &mdash; people of all kinds that carried the will of the Aeons.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 211.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Gepard said that you wanted to help us reverse the damage that the Eternal Freeze and Fragmentum continue to wreak on our planet... but that night, mother summoned me, and ordered me to take a detachment to arrest you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 212.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' What happened? The supreme guardian didn't tell me the details and Gepard had to rush back to the front line... I don't understand...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not the only one...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We really do want to help you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The supreme guardian betrayed us.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 215.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 216.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The Silvermane Guards withdrew to the surface long ago... I must avoid that identity here.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 217.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Until we're back in the Overworld, I propose a temporary truce and cooperation. Your true intentions are of interest to me...
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 218.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' If it helps you to trust me, I'm willing to answer your questions to the best of my ability.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What crime have we committed?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 219.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Let me repeat &mdash; all I received were the supreme guardian's instructions. It is for the adjudication panel to pass judgment on the accused.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 220.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...All the supreme guardian told me was that your identities were counterfeit, and that your intention was to overthrow the rule of the Architects.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you know where the Stellaron is?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 221.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Truthfully, I've never heard of this Stellaron.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 222.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' But if all this catastrophe could be brought to an end simply by sealing it, then I hope its existence proves to be real.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why did the Silvermane Guards withdraw from the underground?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 223.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Fragmentum monster activity on the surface intensified, and hostilities on the front line were critical. To resist the invasion, the Architects had no choice but to redeploy the Guards to the front line.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 224.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...If we couldn't hold our defensive line, then we wouldn't be able to maintain our supply of aid to the underground, which would have collapsed without us. That was the supreme guardian's explanation.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why are you willing to cooperate with us?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 225.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' In truth... I've always felt like something important is being hidden. Whether it's the Architects, mother, or Silvermane Guards, there's always an... unnatural element to their actions.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 bronya 226.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Since encountering you, the unexpected seems to have arrived in waves. I never thought I'd enter the Underworld that has been sealed away for so long...
