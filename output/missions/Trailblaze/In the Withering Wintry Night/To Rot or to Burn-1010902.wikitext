:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 290.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh...? Huh!? So, you're the real chief? Wh&mdash;What about Oleg?
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 222.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oleg has always acted on my behalf &mdash; he helps me deal with all manner of problems in the Underworld.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 223.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Thanks to him, I'm able to make time for the people. I do my best to make sure that they have everything they need... At the same time, I was formulating a plan to deal with Svarog.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 224.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Your arrival unraveled that carefully crafted yet rudimentary plan, hehe... and for that, you have my utmost thanks.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're welcome, all in a day's work for a hero.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 225.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' When the Underworld recovers its freedom, the people will indeed extol you as heroes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We did it for us, it wasn't as selfless as you made out.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 226.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' A person is defined by their actions alone... I think that's how the saying goes? If the Underworld recovers its freedom, the people will see you as heroes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Any chance of a more... tangible show of thanks?
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 227.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You have Wildfire's full support.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 228.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' However, even though Svarog is no longer sealing off the Furnace Core, there's no way that we undergrounders could go pouring onto the surface.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 229.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' That cold-blooded supreme guardian has used lies and tricks to keep the surface separated from the underground. If she detects any change in the Underworld, I don't know what she might resort to...
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 230.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' As for Wildfire, we need more time to build up our strength.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} With things as they are, you want to take a back seat?
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 231.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' No, but we need to wait for the opportune moment. In the meantime, I'm sending someone I trust to go with you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It will be difficult for us to defeat the guardian alone.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 232.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Of course, there's no doubt about that. So, I'll be sending someone I trust to go with you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 291.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Seele...
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 233.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Didn't she tell you? In private, she insisted on accompanying you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 234.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Don't let her carefree nature fool you &mdash; she's actually very discerning, and can read a situation like no one else.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 235.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Seele is a talented scout and a quick thinker &mdash; she takes decisive action. She'll definitely be able to help you. Not to mention... you also have Bronya now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will she stand with us...?
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 236.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It seems like the intel we got from Svarog caused her a significant shock... but with Seele by her side, I know she'll recover.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She got a big shock.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 237.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You're right, but with Seele by her side, I know she'll recover.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 238 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 238 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' (Trailblazer), when's the last time you got some rest? I heard that you've been on your feet looking for Svarog since Rivet Town.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 239.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Health is everything &mdash; you won't be much use if you neglect yours. Let Wildfire take care of the Furnace Core for now. You head back and recuperate.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 240.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' If you're lucky... perhaps tomorrow you can return to the Overworld.
