{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Robot Settlement|Unfortunately, the old friend with the dark blue hair is still your guide this time...<br />To be honest, you would feel more at ease if Pitch-Dark Hook the Great was your guide...<br />But you don't have a choice now... Looks like you'll just have to go with it and follow Sampo to Svarog's base.}}

One of the reasons at least.<br />But there's no choice now... Looks like you'll just have to go with it and follow Sampo to collect the certifications.}}
