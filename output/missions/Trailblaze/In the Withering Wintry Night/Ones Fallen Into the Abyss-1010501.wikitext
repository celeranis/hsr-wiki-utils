{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|Just as your crew and Bronya are being surrounded by the enemies, Seele, backbone of Wildfire arrives just in time to save her but immediately turns to confront her after.<br />In the end, Seele finally reveals her reason for being there: Oleg, leader of Wildfire is asking for an audience with the noble girl from the surface.<br />Naturally, you can't pass up on this opportunity to get in touch with Wildfire. All you have to do is to find Seele in the mines... But where is she?}}

===Investigate the commotion{{subst:void|<!--101050102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Great Mine|update|After arriving at the mines, you realize that things have been turned upside-down here: The miners of this mine have gotten into a violent confrontation with the vagrants.<br />The miners that succeeded in fleeing the scene were petrified and the ones that didn't might be in dire straits. The miners' families are all crowded around the mine entrance...<br />You notice that Chief Oleg probably isn't here. It seems like you'll have to assist Wildfire in settling the unrest before being able to meet him.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 clara 202.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog, it's such a massive vein. I've never seen so much Geomarrow before...
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 svarog 201.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Calculating... Based on the average rate of excavation, this vein is enough to supply Belobog with 231 days of energy, with a margin of error of 7 days.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 svarog 202.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' I sense that your reason for summoning me is not the ore in question. State your true intention, Clara.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 clara 203.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...Right. I wanted Mr. Svarog to see that many miners and vagrants have gotten hurt because of the vein... Can you help them?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 svarog 203.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' I have already prevented the dispute and taken temporary control of the excavation zone. Evaluation result: In the event of no further variables, there will be no large-scale armed conflict within the next 30 days.

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 svarog 209.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Human failure to accept the calculation result is a significant threat to the survival strategy of the Underworld. Calculation complete, result unequivocal: Armed suppression of Wildfire and their allies is the optimal course of action.

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 212.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' I haven't gotten close to voicing the extent of the Underworld's grievances, young lady. But I will respect your request. I will leave it at that, for now.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 213.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Let's get back to the main topic. The name that came to my mind, was Svarog.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 231.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh...!? Isn't Svarog Wildfire's sworn enemy?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 danheng 205.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Why would a mere robot in the Underworld have knowledge of important secrets?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 214.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Sworn enemy? Not how I see it. The young master here is closer. Svarog is a cold and unfeeling machine. He recognizes only the dead reasoning of his calculations.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 215.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Svarog is not against Wildfire... or perhaps I should say: Wildfire isn't even of concern to him. That ancient robot witnessed the war...
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 216.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' If you're looking to pick up a thread... he may well be your best source.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is he really that old? He looks pretty new.
::Is he really that old? He looks pretty new.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 232.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't judge a book by its cover. I myself have put a few centuries behind me. Would you be able to tell?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 danheng 206.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I'm familiar with over twenty {{Rubi|long-life species|Abominations of Abundance}} &mdash; none of them look like you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 233.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! Would it kill you to play along?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean the war with the Antimatter Legion?
::You mean the war with the Antimatter Legion?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 234.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, I remember hearing this world was invaded by the Legion hundreds of years ago.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 217.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Robots don't forget. If Svarog hasn't heard of your Stellaron, then I'm afraid perhaps no one has.

;(Talk to Oleg)
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 222 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 222 f.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Ah, young {{MC|f=lady|m=man}}. This isn't the best place for a chat. Let's keep things brief.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's so great about Svarog?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 223.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Svarog? He's an artificially intelligent being from the Old World. He was here when the underground was first constructed. That's about all I know.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 224.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Now he guards the Furnace Core hub. Many vagrants have established bases in the vicinity, seeking Svarog's protection.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What happened in the mine?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 225.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' You got the gist from Natasha, right? The miners and vagrants came to blows over the vein, then Svarog's subordinates pushed everyone back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just pushed them back?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 226.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Well, perhaps their methods were lacking in finesse, but that's essentially what they did.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 228.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' If you want my take, he prevented another Underworld conflict, even if the execution was rough around the edges.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 229.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' His behavior says something about his thinking: "As long as everyone's been driven out, the conflict is over."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So Svarog wasn't after the vein?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 227.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' You saw for yourself &mdash; after he pushed everyone back, he disappeared. It was clear: He didn't have any interest in the vein itself.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you want to say to Bronya?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 230.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Well, I heard that she's a Silvermane Guard that was sent to arrest you. I expected you to be less friendly around each other... Are you worried about her?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We're working together now.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 231.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Oh, working together? Understood. Rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 234.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' We haven't seen a Silvermane Guard down here for a long time now. I just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't threaten her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 232.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hahahaha, you needn't worry! That Silvermane girl wouldn't be afraid of an old veteran anyway.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Very much so.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 233.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Really? I'm surprised. Still, you can rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.

::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 235.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' It's getting late. You should go back to the town and get some rest.

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 221.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oh, it's you... It looks like the conflict is over for now. Thank goodness, if the numbers of wounded had kept climbing, I don't know what we'd have done. If only he'd have been here...
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 222.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Now's not the time for those thoughts. I need to focus on treating the injured.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I help you with anything?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 223.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You've done enough. Treating the injured is doctor's work.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 224.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' So if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. Relax, if I need your assistance, I won't hesitate to ask.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} And who is "he?"
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 225.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Could you pretend like you didn't hear anything? Now's not the time.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, doctor.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 226.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The same to you and your friends. You've just arrived and already helped resolve such a sizable conflict. I don't know how to thank you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 227.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You'd best get some rest back in town.
