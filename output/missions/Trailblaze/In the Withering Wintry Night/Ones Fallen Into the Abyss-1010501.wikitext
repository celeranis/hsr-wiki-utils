{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|Just as your crew and Bronya are being surrounded by the enemies, Seele, backbone of Wildfire arrives just in time to save her but immediately turns to confront her after.<br />In the end, Seele finally reveals her reason for being there: Oleg, leader of Wildfire is asking for an audience with the noble girl from the surface.<br />Naturally, you can't pass up on this opportunity to get in touch with Wildfire. All you have to do is to find Seele in the mines... But where is she?}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Great Mine|update|After arriving at the mines, you realize that things have been turned upside-down here: The miners of this mine have gotten into a violent confrontation with the vagrants.<br />The miners that succeeded in fleeing the scene were petrified and the ones that didn't might be in dire straits. The miners' families are all crowded around the mine entrance...<br />You notice that Chief Oleg probably isn't here. It seems like you'll have to assist Wildfire in settling the unrest before being able to meet him.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 202.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I haven't seen Oleg. The miners said they saw him take a group further in.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} These people...
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 203.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Miners and their family members. They want an explanation from the instigators.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 204.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' This area up ahead is a vagrant dwelling, but they've sealed off the entrance. I guess they're afraid that angry miners might try to take revenge.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not feeling too good...
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 209.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oh? You look fine to me. Sorry, I need to prioritize the wounded. There have been violent clashes between the miners and local thugs in the last few days &mdash; many people are injured.

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 219.ogg}} '''Seele:''' How could the situation here become such a mess?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 212.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I heard that First Mining Team found a Geomarrow vein with incredible deposits... The initial estimate put it at the largest discovery in the last thirty years.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 220.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Are you serious? That's big news. How come I never heard about it?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 213.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Well, they weren't in a hurry to make it known. Most of the mines have been contaminated by the Fragmentum &mdash; many people are out of work. They were afraid of being overwhelmed if they let the word out.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 214.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But the vagrants here have keen eyes &mdash; they couldn't keep it hidden from them. Some local gangs wanted to profit from the situation, so they blackmailed the mining team for hush money... and that was the final straw.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's the price of guarding a secret.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 215.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' *sigh* ...I can understand your thinking. It's just that the underground is in difficult straits...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The vein should belong to those who discovered it.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 216.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' As it happens, that's exactly the law we have down here. But the vagrants have their own custom: See it, share it.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 217.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' And that's how the clash started. Now both sides are dealing with heavy losses.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 218.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' So, are you guys here to help resolve the conflict?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 221.ogg}} '''Seele:''' They're here because they need a favor from Chief Oleg. I'm escorting them.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 222.ogg}} '''Seele:''' And seeing as you need that helping hand, it wouldn't be too much to ask you to lend one here first, right?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you think Oleg wants to talk about?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 bronya 214.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I think I know what it will concern. Even if Oleg wasn't looking for me, I would've looked for him.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 bronya 215.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I'm certain that the residents of the underground will have a lot they need to vent about. And as a Silvermane Guard, I have a lot that I need to ascertain. Nothing more.

:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 286.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Ahh, them! They're outsiders that Sampo brought down from who-knows-where. They need a favor from Wildfire, so I brought them with me. It'll be faster if they explain.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you the chief? You're a hard man to find.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 205.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hahaha! That's quite the tone to take on our first meeting. I won't forget you in a hurry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pleased to meet you. We're here to make friends with Wildfire.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 206.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hah, it's been a while since I heard that anyone was pleased to meet anyone, haha. I won't forget you in a hurry. Wildfire welcomes you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 207.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' So, you went to all this trouble to find Wildfire. What help is it you need?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Do you mean Cocolia?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Do you mean Sampo?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is he really that old? He looks pretty new.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 232.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't judge a book by its cover. I myself have put a few centuries behind me. Would you be able to tell?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 danheng 206.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I'm familiar with over twenty {{Rubi|long-life species|Abominations of Abundance}} &mdash; none of them look like you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 233.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! Would it kill you to play along?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean the war with the Antimatter Legion?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 mar7th 234.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, I remember hearing this world was invaded by the Legion hundreds of years ago.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 217.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Robots don't forget. If Svarog hasn't heard of your Stellaron, then I'm afraid perhaps no one has.

;(Talk to Oleg)
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 222 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 222 f.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Ah, young {{MC|f=lady|m=man}}. This isn't the best place for a chat. Let's keep things brief.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's so great about Svarog?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 223.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Svarog? He's an artificially intelligent being from the Old World. He was here when the underground was first constructed. That's about all I know.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 224.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Now he guards the Furnace Core hub. Many vagrants have established bases in the vicinity, seeking Svarog's protection.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What happened in the mine?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 225.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' You got the gist from Natasha, right? The miners and vagrants came to blows over the vein, then Svarog's subordinates pushed everyone back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just pushed them back?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 226.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Well, perhaps their methods were lacking in finesse, but that's essentially what they did.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 228.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' If you want my take, he prevented another Underworld conflict, even if the execution was rough around the edges.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 229.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' His behavior says something about his thinking: "As long as everyone's been driven out, the conflict is over."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So Svarog wasn't after the vein?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 227.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' You saw for yourself &mdash; after he pushed everyone back, he disappeared. It was clear: He didn't have any interest in the vein itself.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 228.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' If you want my take, he prevented another Underworld conflict, even if the execution was rough around the edges.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you want to say to Bronya?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 230.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Well, I heard that she's a Silvermane Guard that was sent to arrest you. I expected you to be less friendly around each other... Are you worried about her?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We're working together now.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 231.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Oh, working together? Understood. Rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 234.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' We haven't seen a Silvermane Guard down here for a long time now. I just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't threaten her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 232.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hahahaha, you needn't worry! That Silvermane girl wouldn't be afraid of an old veteran anyway.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 234.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' We haven't seen a Silvermane Guard down here for a long time now. I just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Very much so.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 233.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Really? I'm surprised. Still, you can rest easy, I won't make things difficult for her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 234.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' We haven't seen a Silvermane Guard down here for a long time now. I just wanna ask her a few questions, nothing more.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've nothing to ask.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 oleg 235.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' It's getting late. You should go back to the town and get some rest.

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 221.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oh, it's you... It looks like the conflict is over for now. Thank goodness, if the numbers of wounded had kept climbing, I don't know what we'd have done. If only he'd have been here...
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 222.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Now's not the time for those thoughts. I need to focus on treating the injured.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I help you with anything?
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 223.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You've done enough. Treating the injured is doctor's work.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 224.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' So if you're not hurt yourself, you should go back and get some rest. Relax, if I need your assistance, I won't hesitate to ask.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} And who is "he?"
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 225.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Could you pretend like you didn't hear anything? Now's not the time.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, doctor.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 226.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The same to you and your friends. You've just arrived and already helped resolve such a sizable conflict. I don't know how to thank you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 natasha 227.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You'd best get some rest back in town.
