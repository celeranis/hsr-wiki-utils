===Enter the Great Mine===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|Just as your crew and Bronya are being surrounded by the enemies, Seele, backbone of Wildfire arrives just in time to save her but immediately turns to confront her after.<br />In the end, Seele finally reveals her reason for being there: Oleg, leader of Wildfire is asking for an audience with the noble girl from the surface.<br />Naturally, you can't pass up on this opportunity to get in touch with Wildfire. All you have to do is to find Seele in the mines... But where is she?}}

===Investigate the commotion===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|After arriving at the mines, you realize that things have been turned upside-down here: The miners of this mine have gotten into a violent confrontation with the vagrants.<br />The miners that succeeded in fleeing the scene were petrified and the ones that didn't might be in dire straits. The miners' families are all crowded around the mine entrance...<br />You notice that Chief Oleg probably isn't here. It seems like you'll have to assist Wildfire in settling the unrest before being able to meet him.}}

===Go deep into the mines and help the miners along the way===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|On the way deeper into the mines, you can hear the constant screams in the distance. It is obvious that things have gotten pretty serious, you must help the fleeing miners along the way.<br />However, for some reason, you seem to be able to hear the sound of someone snoring...<br />Could it be that you're having hallucinations from the fatigue of travel?}}

===Repair the out of order mine cart===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The way forward is cut off by a mine cart out of order. With Seele's instructions, you decide to search for backup parts in the area to repair the mine cart and move it out of the way.<br />"It's gonna be hectic trying to look for the parts." You can't help but picture Mr. Yang destroying the cart with his black hole.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You fix the out of order mine cart and move it out of the way, opening the path continuing downward.<br />This is near the bottom of the mines and you notice Seele's cautious expression and sharp gaze...<br />Her expression is normally scary enough already, so what is it that would make her show an even more serious look? You're not sure, but there is one thing that you are certain of...<br />Danger is closing in and you should make yourself prepared.}}
