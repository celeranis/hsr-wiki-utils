{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|Just as your crew and Bronya are being surrounded by the enemies, Seele, backbone of Wildfire arrives just in time to save her but immediately turns to confront her after.<br />In the end, Seele finally reveals her reason for being there: Oleg, leader of Wildfire is asking for an audience with the noble girl from the surface.<br />Naturally, you can't pass up on this opportunity to get in touch with Wildfire.

===Investigate the commotion{{subst:void|<!--101050102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Great Mine|update|After arriving at the mines, you realize that things have been turned upside-down here: The miners of this mine have gotten into a violent confrontation with the vagrants.<br />The miners that succeeded in fleeing the scene were petrified and the ones that didn't might be in dire straits. The miners' families are all crowded around the mine entrance...<br />You notice that Chief Oleg probably isn't here. It seems like you'll have to assist Wildfire in settling the unrest before being able to meet him.}}
