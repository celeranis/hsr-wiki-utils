{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|The Captain's words linger: The steadfast Architects built this Towering Citadel. Belobog remains forever warm in the face of unrelenting cold...<br />His tone was strange, as if he was quoting a historical record, and made a deep impression on you... Hopefully, this doesn't ruin your enjoyment of the fancy hotel's fluffy mattress.<br />There's still some time before nightfall. Why don't you take a tour around the ancient city in the meantime?}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|After an entire day of sightseeing, you've got a complete understanding of the local culture and are just an appointment at Belobog's Administrative Department away from becoming its actual citizens.<br />It's getting late and not much more is happening on the streets. It's a good time to return to the Goethe Hotel and bring this so-far pleasant day to an end.}}
