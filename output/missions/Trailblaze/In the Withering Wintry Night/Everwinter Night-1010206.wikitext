{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|The Captain's words linger: The steadfast Architects built this Towering Citadel. Belobog remains forever warm in the face of unrelenting cold...<br />His tone was strange, as if he was quoting a historical record, and made a deep impression on you... Hopefully, this doesn't ruin your enjoyment of the fancy hotel's fluffy mattress.<br />There's still some time before nightfall. Why don't you take a tour around the ancient city in the meantime?}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 1 serval 211.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The heater you saw is just a standard Geomarrow radiator. They may not look like much, but they're a real lifeline to the people.
:{{A|VO chapter1 1 serval 212.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The blizzards here are brutal. If we didn't have a reliable way of keeping warm, Belobog would long since have become a dead city &mdash; both above and below the surface.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is Geomarrow?
::{{A|VO chapter1 1 serval 213.ogg}} '''Serval:''' It's an ore &mdash; a special energy resource. Whether it's keeping the city warm or keeping our counters ticking, everything runs on Geomarrow.
::{{A|VO chapter1 1 serval 214.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Geomarrow grows beneath the surface of the planet, and specialist Underworld mining teams are there to extract it.
