===Follow Gepard Landau to the Guardian's residence===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|The bad news is that your buddy Sampo has abandoned you and left you to deal with Gepard Landau, the Silvermane Guard Captain, alone. The good news, however, is that the imposing soldier is actually quite flexible.<br />You successfully persuade Gepard by making him believe that you are from a world beyond the sky. He promises to escort you to the Supreme Guardian at Belobog.<br />Everything looked perfect... There's no reason for doubt, all you have to do is follow the Silvermane Guards.}}

===Report negotiation results to Gepard===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|The Supreme Guardian of Belobog is elegant and majestic. She speaks with precision and reveals nothing more than what is needed. You're not good at dealing with people like her.<br />Good thing the Guardian sees you as honored guests and has even arranged for your stay at a high-end hotel... You've decided: This is enough reason to fully place your trust in her.<br />All in all, the results of the negotiation were optimistic &mdash; but are they enough to put a smile on the stern Captain's face?}}

===Visit Neverwinter Workshop===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|The Captain's words linger: The steadfast Architects built this Towering Citadel. Belobog remains forever warm in the face of unrelenting cold...<br />His tone was strange, as if he was quoting a historical record, and made a deep impression on you... Hopefully, this doesn't ruin your enjoyment of the fancy hotel's fluffy mattress.<br />There's still some time before nightfall. Why don't you take a tour around the ancient city in the meantime?}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|After an entire day of sightseeing, you've got a complete understanding of the local culture and are just an appointment at Belobog's Administrative Department away from becoming its actual citizens.<br />It's getting late and not much more is happening on the streets. It's a good time to return to the Goethe Hotel and bring this so-far pleasant day to an end.}}
