===Follow Gepard Landau to the Guardian's residence{{subst:void|<!--101020102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|The bad news is that your buddy Sampo has abandoned you and left you to deal with Gepard Landau, the Silvermane Guard Captain, alone. The good news, however, is that the imposing soldier is actually quite flexible.<br />You successfully persuade Gepard by making him believe that you are from a world beyond the sky. He promises to escort you to the Supreme Guardian at Belobog.<br />Everything looked perfect... There's no reason for doubt, all you have to do is follow the Silvermane Guards.}}
