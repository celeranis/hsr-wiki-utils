===Follow Gepard Landau to the Guardian's residence{{subst:void|<!--101020102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|The bad news is that your buddy Sampo has abandoned you and left you to deal with Gepard Landau, the Silvermane Guard Captain, alone. The good news, however, is that the imposing soldier is actually quite flexible.<br />You successfully persuade Gepard by making him believe that you are from a world beyond the sky. He promises to escort you to the Supreme Guardian at Belobog.<br />Everything looked perfect... There's no reason for doubt, all you have to do is follow the Silvermane Guards.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|The Supreme Guardian of Belobog is elegant and majestic. She speaks with precision and reveals nothing more than what is needed. You're not good at dealing with people like her.<br />Good thing the Guardian sees you as honored guests and has even arranged for your stay at a high-end hotel... You've decided: This is enough reason to fully place your trust in her.<br />All in all, the results of the negotiation were optimistic &mdash; but are they enough to put a smile on the stern Captain's face?}}
