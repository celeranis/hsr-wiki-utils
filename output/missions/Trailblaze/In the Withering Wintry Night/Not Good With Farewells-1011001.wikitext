===Go over everything with the group{{subst:void|<!--101100101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|The truth of the planet is almost clear: The great calamity that ravaged the planet originated from the Stellaron.<br />The past Guardians have known about this but could do nothing about it. In the end, they chose to lie so that the city and its people could continue to live on the brink of desperation in this fabricated momentary peace.<br />But this does not solve the problem. You are well aware that only by destroying the Stellaron can this planet and Belobog return to their correct path, and enable the Express to embark on its journey.<br />Share your thoughts with your companions and decide on your next moves.}}

===Return to the Goethe Grand Hotel and rest{{subst:void|<!--101100113-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|After an exchange of ideas and opinions, you quickly come up with a conclusion: The most urgent matter at hand is to return to the hotel and get a good night's sleep. You'll find out what the Wildfire thinks later.<br />It may not sound like the most heroic thing to do, but a soft and fluffy mattress after hard fights and toil is simply too much of a temptation.<br />A short break goes a long way towards preparing for the journey ahead. This is true for every traveler, and you are no exception.}}

===Go to bed{{subst:void|<!--101100103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Cheap Room|update|Having had a thorough discussion, you quickly conclude that the priority is to return to the hotel and get a good night's sleep. You will ask what Wildfire makes of this later.<br />It may sound outlandish, but how can one say no to a soft mattress after a long journey and harsh battle?<br />You toss all the complaints about your bed behind, thinking it must be the nicest thing this world has to offer.<br />Nighty-night. May you no longer be troubled by nightmares.}}

===Meet with the group{{subst:void|<!--101100107-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|Finally, a good night's sleep. Or not &mdash; because you can't remember if you had a nightmare during the night.<br />Wouldn't hurt to stay a while longer to appreciate this simple yet cozy little room of yours... After all, there's no way to tell when you will be able to come back.<br />Go meet the group when you are ready.}}

===Discuss future plans with Wildfire members{{subst:void|<!--101100108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|The longer you stay in this giant space underground, the harder it is to differentiate between the cold rock ceiling and the sky.<br />It's time to return to the surface... But you wouldn't be able to without any help &mdash; because if you could, you would've already done so, isn't that right?<br />"Wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is Wildfire." That is what Natasha once said. Go and ask them for a favor for the last time.}}
