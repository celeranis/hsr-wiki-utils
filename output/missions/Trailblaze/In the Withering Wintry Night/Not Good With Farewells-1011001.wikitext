{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|The truth of the planet is almost clear: The great calamity that ravaged the planet originated from the Stellaron.<br />The past Guardians have known about this but could do nothing about it. In the end, they chose to lie so that the city and its people could continue to live on the brink of desperation in this fabricated momentary peace.<br />But this does not solve the problem. You are well aware that only by destroying the Stellaron can this planet and Belobog return to their correct path, and enable the Express to embark on its journey.<br />Share your thoughts with your companions and decide on your next moves.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 201.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ahhhh... Well, now that we're done with that whole situation in the Underworld, we can finally look for the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 202.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* But thinking about it, I feel a bit bad about Clara... We promised her that our talks with Svarog would go peacefully...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Svarog attacked first.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 201 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 201 f.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' (Trailblazer), you tried your best to persuade him. It's my fault for not preparing better for such a situation in advance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I wasn't able to persuade Svarog...
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 202.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You tried your best, don't blame yourself. I should've considered such a situation in advance. And it was Svarog who attacked first, we didn't have any other choice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I forgot to be more diplomatic.

:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 205.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' All in all, the mission is going super smoothly!
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 204.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' But we still have a lot left to figure out. For instance...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Where's the Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 205.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Exactly. We don't even have the Stellaron's coordinates and location.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 206.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Cocolia's sudden change in attitude is also very curious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Why does Cocolia have it in for us?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 207.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Exactly. There must be a reason for this sudden change in her attitude.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 208.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' And, we still don't have the coordinates and location of the Stellaron.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Who is this Sampo character!?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 209.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...That's not of foremost concern.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 210.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What's important is that we still don't have the exact location and coordinates of the Stellaron. Nor have we figured out the reason behind Cocolia's sudden change in attitude.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 211.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' We still haven't put all of the pieces together...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, I've been having some dreams...
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 212.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Dreams?
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 206.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, I remember you mentioned something about strange dreams before...

:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 207.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It would be weird to call it a coincidence.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 214.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I'm wondering if these dreams aren't just random, if there is some meaning behind them... Maybe you're having them because...
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 208 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 208 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Because of... the Stellaron inside {{MC|f=her|m=him}}?
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 215.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's my hunch, but I have no proof.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 mar7th 209.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well then that's as good as nothing for now... So, what should we do when we get back above ground? After all this talk, we're still back at square one...
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 216.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' We solve a puzzle one piece at a time. Let's get some rest. We'll talk to Wildfire tomorrow and get to the bottom of this.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 danheng 217.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Also, there's still one more key character we haven't talked to yet. Her connection to Cocolia may be the key to cracking this mystery.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Any place worth visiting underground?
::'''Elaine:''' Worth visiting? Let me think...
::'''Elaine:''' The Goethe Grand Hotel probably. And then it's the Fight Club.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about the Goethe Grand Hotel.
:::'''Elaine:''' The Goethe Grand Hotel is right there. It's fancy, isn't it? After all, this is the Goethe family's first shop in the Underworld. It's the main store in Belobog!
:::'''Elaine:''' Gertie is the owner of the hotel and also my master. Not sure if you've met her...
:::'''Elaine:''' She's a great cook. You should try the food she makes.

:::'''Elaine:''' The Fight Club... it's said that there are professional boxers fighting and monsters everyday... it's especially lively at night.

::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do you want to catch olms?
::'''Elaine:''' Hmm... because they are delicious?
::'''Elaine:''' It may sound funny but it's true. Olms are a common food in the Underworld. Many people would buy them for cooking.
::'''Elaine:''' Speaking of which, make sure you try the Iron Pot Braised Olm at the Goethe Grand Hotel.
::'''Elaine:''' I can assure you, that is the most delicious olm dish in the Underworld!
::'''Elaine:''' Ahhh... it makes me drool whenever I think of the crispy puff and the juicy olm meat. Master Gertie is such a wonderful cook...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you take any side jobs?
::'''Elaine:''' Well... I do. I will grab a net to catch olms after work...
::'''Elaine:''' However, I don't think I'm making any money. I usually can only catch two or three. When I try to sell them, I am told the price of olm has dropped...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you ever tried any other part-time job than catching olms?
::'''Elaine:''' Well... I did, actually quite a few.
::'''Elaine:''' But I only tried once or twice... In the end I realize the other jobs are more tiring than catching olms. Also, I'm not making much more money...
::'''Elaine:''' But catching olms is already not very profitable! I really don't get it... am I just unlucky? *sob*

;(Talk to Antonia)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I heard that the mine hasn't been peaceful lately.
::'''Antonia:''' Yes. As you saw last time in the mine, it's been a bit chaotic... but it will end. The vagrants will stop messing around sooner or later.
::'''Antonia:''' After all, they've got mouths to feed. If they really got rid of all the professional mining teams, those hooligans won't be able to make a living.
::'''Antonia:''' They are well aware of this, which is why they have never crossed the line. A small reward goes a long way with them. I just didn't expect the news to get all the way to Svarog this time...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I heard you recruited some of the vagrants into the mining team.
::'''Antonia:''' Well, how should I put it...? Life isn't easy. If Boulder Town also gets eroded by the Fragmentum, we will have to find another livelihood. Who wouldn't want some help at a time like that?
::'''Antonia:''' But the old miners have their own ideas. They think the vagrants have made a mess of the mining team... and the vagrants aren't happy with their payment and feel that they've lost freedom... In the end, neither side is happy.
::'''Antonia:''' But I know what I am doing. This minor setback will not change my mind. Don't worry about it.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you have any recommendations for activities in the underground?
::'''Antonia:''' The Fight Club is quite popular. But personally, I wouldn't pay a shield for that kind of cheap show. It's vulgar and low-class.
::'''Antonia:''' There is a restaurant, the one owned by Gertie. The food there is quite good... so long as Gertie doesn't come up with some weird recipes on a whim...
::'''Antonia:''' Also, I heard there will be a rap concert where the vagrants are? I don't know how to appreciate that kind of thing, so I've never been there. Go check it out if you are interested. Just be careful there.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all questions I have.

;(Talk to Gertie)
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 gertie 201.ogg}} '''Gertie:''' You're back! I've heard from Wildfire that you helped resolve that whole situation with Svarog. Amazing!
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 gertie 202.ogg}} '''Gertie:''' It must have been exhausting. Please, have some food and get a good night's rest.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I suppose it would be good to get some sleep...
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Actually, I still have a lot of energy.

;(Talk to Fidora)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you a mechanic?
:::'''Fidora:''' Of course. No one but a mechanic could make robots, could they?
:::'''Fidora:''' ...Well, actually, many people among the vagrants also possess that skill.
:::'''Fidora:''' But I'm different from them! They make robots for the Modified Robot Fight &mdash; the robots they make fight each other... I don't get the fun in it.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you need a language module for?
:::'''Fidora:''' It's... Why are you being so nosey?
:::'''Fidora:''' Okay, I'll tell you... I'm trying to build a robot that can interact with humans emotionally.
:::'''Fidora:''' Not the kind of machine that only follows a program or answers the question you ask &mdash; A robot that understands human language, and speaks and acts like a normal human being.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you want to build something like that?
::::'''Fidora:''' Why? Because it's my dream, of course!
::::'''Fidora:''' I want to create a robot with emotions... it's my ultimate goal as an amateur mechanic!
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you making an android?
::::'''Fidora:''' Android? What's that? It sounds weird... Right now, all I want to do is to equip the robot with a language module and do some additional optimization and improvement.
::::'''Fidora:''' In my opinion, mechanical structures are much more beautiful than the human body... I'm not stupid enough to try to make a robot look like a human. How boring would that be?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought you were making a humanoid mech that could be driven.
::::'''Fidora:''' I've thought about that... I heard that boys all dream of fighting in mechs.
::::'''Fidora:''' I get why they think that's cool. But for me, the most worthwhile research is to make robots that have human emotions...
::::'''Fidora:''' Anyway, that's all. Do you have any other questions?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Exit}} Um... Nothing.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you a mechanic?

::'''Balaway:''' Now that you've asked, let me explain to you. Do you know the "Eternal Freeze?"
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes.
:::'''Balaway:''' Good. You seem to know some of the history here.
:::'''Balaway:''' Although it's warm inside the wall all year round, there are constant snowstorms outside the wall. If you are really from the Outside, you must have seen it.
:::'''Balaway:''' This snowstorm isn't just temporary... Since seven hundred years ago, this heavy snow hasn't stopped for a minute.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is your appraisal process?

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm interested in your appraisal method.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you distinguish the difficulty of the appraisal?
::'''Balaway:''' It's a bit complicated. Most smaller items have relatively simple structures. You can find out its function structure by referring to respective documents.
::'''Balaway:''' The bigger items are the real trouble. Generally speaking, I have to disassemble them and check everything carefully.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Disassemble?
:::'''Balaway:''' Right. The function and value of relics can only be appraised accurately after they are disassembled.
:::'''Balaway:''' By the way, once the relics are disassembled, there is a risk that they can't be reassembled.

===Discuss future plans with Wildfire members{{subst:void|<!--101100108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|The longer you stay in this giant space underground, the harder it is to differentiate between the cold rock ceiling and the sky.<br />It's time to return to the surface... But you wouldn't be able to without any help &mdash; because if you could, you would've already done so, isn't that right?<br />"Wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is Wildfire." That is what Natasha once said. Go and ask them for a favor for the last time.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 203.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' By the way, sorry for keeping that whole thing about her being the actual leader of Wildfire a secret. Hahaha...
