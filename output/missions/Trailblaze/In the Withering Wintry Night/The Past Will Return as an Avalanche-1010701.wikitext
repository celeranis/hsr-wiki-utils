===Find a vantage point for observation{{subst:void|<!--101070102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|According to Natasha, there may still be remaining medical supplies in the abandoned Rivet Town. The mission for you and Seele is to retrieve the supplies and deplete them of their final value... Erm, to let them shine and be useful in the clinic.<br />You arrive at the entrance of the mining town. Although this place looks to be completely desolate, in reality, Fragmentum monsters have been dwelling here for quite some time. This is a dangerous place.<br />It'd be best to make observations and plan out your route before making your way in.}}

The mission for you and Seele is to retrieve the supplies and deplete them of their final value... Erm, to let them shine and be useful in the clinic.<br />Seele believes that the supplies Natasha is after are likely to be stocked up in the town's market square. Why don't you head over there and take a look?}}

===Look for missing supplies on the market square{{subst:void|<!--101070118-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You come to the market square only to find the crates for medical supplies looted empty.<br />The looter, however, seems too gentle for creatures in the Fragmentum, judging by what happened at the scene...<br />Bronya and Seele have arrived at the scene and both of them think that this does not look like something that monsters would do.<br />The perpetrator is likely to still be in the vicinity. Join Seele in her search on the square and leave no stone unturned!}}

===Find the way to the orphanage{{subst:void|<!--101070123-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You discover that the culprit who robbed the supplies is a young thief named Eric. Bronya's generosity has compelled her to make the decision of trading with the thief for the supplies, even though Seele finds him to be untrustworthy.<br />In return for Bronya's friendliness, Eric shares relevant intel regarding the orphanage with everyone. But does this mean that he will change his ways? The answer is unknown &mdash; however, maybe you will have the opportunity to witness it sometime in the future.<br />Right now, your primary objective is to head to the orphanage and continue your search for the supplies.}}

===Go to the orphanage and search for the supplies{{subst:void|<!--101070105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You finally find your way through the complex roads of Rivet Town and discover the path to the orphanage. As you make your way uphill, you can see the luxurious mansions that overlook the town, watching its every move each and every day.<br />You see that Seele's expression has turned complex, but what's more confusing is that Bronya seems to be having the same emotions...}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You arrive at the orphanage entrance and have somewhat understood what's bothering Bronya &mdash; although it's just speculation, she might have lived here in the past...<br />Anyways, first search this place for the supplies that Natasha wants.}}

===Search for supplies around the orphanage{{subst:void|<!--101070108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You naturally find the supplies, Bronya naturally finds the item to prove her past, and Seele naturally feels very shocked about all of this.<br />The two who almost became childhood friends naturally go for a trip down the memory lane and begin a very long and deep conversation...<br />Although you would really like to ask them when they became such great friends that share all their secrets with one another, would you be able to bring yourself to disturb the rare peace in front of you?<br />You couldn't. So you decide to venture further around the orphanage to search for the supplies...}}

===Ask Clara why she's here{{subst:void|<!--101070120-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Rivet Town|update|You've had the feeling that someone has gotten to the supplies before you but you didn't think it'd be someone that you were close with.<br />Okay, maybe not that close... but you've at least met her before &mdash; you're technically family to Clara now.<br />So what is cute Clara doing alone (with a robot) in such a dangerous place? You have to get to the bottom of this.}}
