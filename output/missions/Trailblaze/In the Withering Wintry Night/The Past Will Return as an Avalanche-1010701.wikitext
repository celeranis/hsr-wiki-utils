::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 209.ogg}} '''Clara:''' There are a lot of people hurt at the vagrant camp, I guess the miners are no different? *sigh* If everyone could just get along, things would be easier...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Shouldn't you be the one leaving, missy?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 210.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Perkins is protecting me. I'll be alright. I'm going to leave after I gather up these painkillers.
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 211 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 211 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...Uh, is that what you're here for too?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 213.ogg}} '''Clara:''' That would make sense. I'm sure a lot of miners are injured, right? *sigh* If everyone could just get along, things would be easier...
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 214.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mm... Here you are. I hope the medicine is of help to you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's your relationship with Svarog?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Svarog here, too?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 215.ogg}} '''Clara:''' No.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 216.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog, he... he's my family. I met Mr. Svarog when I was real little. He took me in and took care of me.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 217.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I'm really sorry about what happened back in the Great Mine... Mr. Svarog doesn't trust any humans besides me, especially everyone from Wildfire.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did Svarog attack us?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 218.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog doesn't want to hurt people, but he always follows the calculations of his analysis. He thinks that interaction with humans is... inefficient.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did Svarog want to get involved in the incident in the mines?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 219.ogg}} '''Clara:''' He heard that the miners and vagrants had begun to engage in a large-scale conflict... He wanted to stop everyone from getting hurt fighting over the mines.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 220.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Wildfire wants everyone to leave the underground... But Mr. Svarog wants everyone to stay here. According to his calculations, the overground is already unsafe.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the underground is safer?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 221.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes, at least according to Mr. Svarog's calculations...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There must be some error in his system.
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 222.ogg}} '''Clara:''' No, there can't be... Mr. Svarog is healthy, his system is always being maintained.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So he stands guard at the huge pillar stopping people from leaving?
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 223.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes... Mr. Svarog is very stubborn.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 224.ogg}} '''Clara:''' He says that his responsibility is "preservation." To do that, he must make decisions that best protect humanity.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Fragmentum will swallow up all of the underground sooner or later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds a lot like the Supreme Guardian.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 clara 225.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I know that Wildfire wants to talk to Mr. Svarog... But no matter how many times you talk to him, Mr. Svarog won't change his mind...
