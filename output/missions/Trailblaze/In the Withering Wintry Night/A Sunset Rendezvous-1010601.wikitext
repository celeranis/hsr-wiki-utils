===Go to the accommodation arranged by Oleg===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|Peace has at long last returned to the mines. Oleg, chief of Wildfire, has agreed to work with you to show his gratitude towards you, the Nameless, for your support. He has arranged your accommodation.<br />Speaking of accommodation, the last time you got invited to stay by someone important and then got backstabbed does not seem too long ago.<br />Maybe it's not too late to go back to Pom-Pom and ask for some tripwire mines...}}

===Have some rest at the Goethe Grand Hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Peace has returned to the mines at least for now. Oleg, chief of Wildfire, has agreed to work with you to show his gratitude towards you, the Nameless, for your support. He has arranged your accommodation.<br />The fact that this "grand" hotel is hardly furnished, leaving no places for any hit man to hide, makes this place almost feel like home.<br />All things considered, this is the coziest spot Wildfire can afford to spare... Save your complaints for tomorrow and have a good night's sleep.}}
