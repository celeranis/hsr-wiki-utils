{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Backwater Pass|As the daughter of the Supreme Guardian, Bronya has always been quick and decisive &mdash; this pursuit operation targeted at you was no exception.<br />Good thing your "good pal" Sampo arrived just in time to rescue you. It's just that... it would've been better if he didn't knock you out with the smoke bomb made from questionable ingredients.<br />In your daze, you realize that you aren't tied up but placed on a bed somewhere &mdash; to a degree, this tells you that you're not in immediate danger. You'll have to ask the unfamiliar woman in front of you for more details.}}
