===Talk to the unfamiliar woman and find out about what's happening===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|As the daughter of the Supreme Guardian, Bronya has always been quick and decisive &mdash; this pursuit operation targeted at you was no exception.<br />Good thing your "good pal" Sampo arrived just in time to rescue you. It's just that... it would've been better if he didn't knock you out with the smoke bomb made from questionable ingredients.<br />In your daze, you realize that you aren't tied up but placed on a bed somewhere &mdash; to a degree, this tells you that you're not in immediate danger. You'll have to ask the unfamiliar woman in front of you for more details.}}

===Find March 7th and Dan Heng===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|The doctor named Natasha explained the entire incident to you. You now know two things:<br />One, Dan Heng has been grabbed by Sampo. And two, March 7th abandoned you to go shopping. As for Bronya... Well, you're not too concerned about the well-being of your enemies right now.<br />Whatever the case, you decide to find your two companions first and have a deep conversation about why they left you behind.}}

===See what March 7th is doing===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|You find March 7th and discover her to be immersed in a children's game and doesn't notice you at all.<br />"Of course," you think. "When a companion is unconscious and the other missing, what better way to resolve it than to 'find a few kids to play games with'?"<br />You've convinced yourself. Now it's the cute March 7th's turn to do the same.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|March 7th attempts to convince you but you no longer care for it as much anymore, because the kids have started taunting you.<br />You will not stand for this! It's time to show these children the cruelty of the grown-ups' world.<br />Little do they know that the practice just now was just a warm-up... The cruel and real Hide-and-seek is only about to begin!}}

===Follow Hook to the Fight Club===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|You've won and claimed victory in the game of hide-and-seek. You put on enough of a display of the rules of survival in the grown-ups' world to cause some emotional trauma for these kids.<br />And now, the loser will have to fulfill her duty and guide the winner to the Fight Club to find Dan Heng.<br />However, you still have no choice but to address this puny loser as the Pitch-Dark Hook the Great... You didn't take a liking to this.}}
