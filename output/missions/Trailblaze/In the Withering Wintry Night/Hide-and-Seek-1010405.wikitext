===Talk to the unfamiliar woman and find out about what's happening{{subst:void|<!--101040102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Natasha's Clinic|As the daughter of the Supreme Guardian, Bronya has always been quick and decisive &mdash; this pursuit operation targeted at you was no exception.<br />Good thing your "good pal" Sampo arrived just in time to rescue you. It's just that... it would've been better if he didn't knock you out with the smoke bomb made from questionable ingredients.<br />In your daze, you realize that you aren't tied up but placed on a bed somewhere &mdash; to a degree, this tells you that you're not in immediate danger. You'll have to ask the unfamiliar woman in front of you for more details.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

:{{DIcon|Talk}} ???
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 211.ogg}} '''???:''' How are you feeling? Any aches or pains?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, I feel much better.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 212.ogg}} '''???:''' Good. You were out for a while, I was beginning to worry. You were saying some strange things.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got migraines all over my body.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 213.ogg}} '''???:''' ...I hope you're joking, hehe... That's either an interesting metaphor, or you hit your head.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I had a weird dream...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 214.ogg}} '''???:''' I bet, you were mumbling something about "Stellarons" and "wishes"... I couldn't make sense of it.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 215.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Well, now that you're awake, you should probably try moving your limbs. I'm Natasha &mdash; a doctor in the underground. You've already spent a day in my clinic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nice to meet you, I'm (Trailblazer).
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 216.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Nice to meet you too... Hehe, you're very polite.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this the underground?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 217.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Yes... it's a place that's been sealed off and neglected by the overgrounders for more than a decade. The underground has none of the splendor of the surface &mdash; the people here dig tunnels and mine ore to make a living.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is your clinic?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 218.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Mm-hmm, I'm afraid the conditions underground are terrible. People get sick easily here, and I'm the only doctor.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 219.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sampo's gone to clear up a mess of his own making, so I'm looking after you in the meantime. Based on your current state, I don't think there's any cause for alarm &mdash; you seem perfectly healthy.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 220.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' So if you don't mind, I'll go and take a look at the other patients?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why did I pass out?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 221.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sampo just told me that you lost consciousness. He didn't say why. Still, I'll wager it had something to do with him &mdash; he's always tinkering with his devices.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 222.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Anyway, the opinion of the clinic is that none of you have come to harm.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} People were following us...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 223.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sampo told me. Don't worry, the Silvermane Guards won't follow you below ground. We've been cut off from the surface for many years. Even when things were at their worst down here, they never showed.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 224.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Of course, I don't know the whole story behind why the Architects ordered the lockdown. Who knows, thanks to you, they might finally be about to lift it... something that Wildfire's wanted to achieve for a long time now.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's our medical bill...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 225.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oh, please, you needn't worry. You've just been asleep for a while, I barely had to lift a finger.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 226.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I... might've exaggerated your condition for Sampo's ears... but that guy owes me. He better bring me back some medicine.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where are my friends?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 227.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' They've been up for a while already. The young guy with the dark hair left first &mdash; he went with Sampo.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 228.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Your rowdier friend took off soon after waking up. I imagine she'll be taking a stroll nearby.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 229.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' As for the girl in the Silvermane Guard uniform, I told Sampo to watch her... but it seems that he left his post and she made a run for it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who is this Sampo anyway?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 230.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Good question... he's a man of mystery. He claims to be a simple cross-border businessman &mdash; not that there's much to interest an Overworlder down here. Either way, he's got a surprising number of connections.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 231.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I've managed to secure more than a few urgent medical supplies through him, and he's been a big help to Wildfire... In any case, I don't think his intentions are sinister.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I need to meet up with them.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 232.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sure, but don't push yourself. If you start feeling unwell, come straight back and tell me.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 233.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...And if you run into any trouble, you can try asking for Wildfire.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wildfire?
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 234.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It's a grassroots organization. Think of it as the Silvermane Guards of the underground, but less stone-hearted.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, Dr. Natasha.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't thank you enough. Bye for now.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 235.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' No need to thank me. It's a doctor's duty to heal.

===Find March 7th and Dan Heng{{subst:void|<!--101040103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Natasha's Clinic|update|The doctor named Natasha explained the entire incident to you. You now know two things:<br />One, Dan Heng has been grabbed by Sampo. And two, March 7th abandoned you to go shopping. As for Bronya... Well, you're not too concerned about the well-being of your enemies right now.<br />Whatever the case, you decide to find your two companions first and have a deep conversation about why they left you behind.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 236.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Y'know, the underground has been cut off from the surface for years. For you outsiders to descend on us out of nowhere is pretty incredible.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 237.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Everything alright? You feeling okay?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I want to ask about the Underworld...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 238.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The Underworld? What do you want to know?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do people live down here?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 239.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Because we need Geomarrow. After Belobog's construction, the demand for energy kept increasing. The Eternal Freeze prevented us from expanding outwards, so our only choice was to go down.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 240.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The people answered the call of the Architects and descended, excavating ore veins and establishing mines. Before we were sealed off, it was an honor to work underground.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 241.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It was a choice... the pursuit of arduous labor for the survival of our entire civilization.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How is life in the Underworld?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 242.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...It's never been good. Conditions are tough both above and below the surface. The Overworld is faced with the Eternal Freeze and Fragmentum corrosion, and the Underworld has to contend with hard labor, suffocating heat, and serious shortages.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 243.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It's been over a decade since the Silvermane Guards withdrew from the Underworld, and the situation here has only gotten worse. The only contact we have is the exchange of Geomarrow for goods.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 244.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' And what's more... the Fragmentum corrosion has begun to reach us down here, too...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to ask something else.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I want to ask about Sampo...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 245.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Ask away, but I'm afraid I don't know a lot about him myself.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How did you get to know him?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 246.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' A meticulously choreographed "chance meeting..." Sampo is pretty good at orchestrating unexpected encounters, and he always leaves a lasting impression.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 247.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' According to him, that's the gift of a businessman.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you know where he went?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 248.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hehe, I hear that question a lot &mdash; seems like he owes everyone something. That's why he never discloses his whereabouts.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 249.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' When people need him, he appears, and when people really need him, he disappears. Sampo's first and second laws of motion.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} What is Wildfire?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 251.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Wildfire is a volunteer grassroots organization. Like I said, you can think of it as the Silvermane Guards of the underground.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 252.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' They've taken on the duties of the Guards: Maintain safety and order in the Underworld and compete with Fragmentum corrosion for living space.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How can I find them?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 2 natasha 253.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Wherever there is hardship and a cry for help, there is Wildfire.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} With my help!
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 237.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, yeah, you're in the footnote somewhere~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure did!
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 238.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' About time I got some credit for it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Doesn't sound like something you'd say...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 239.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! I read books y'know!
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 240.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, you can tell us now, right?
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 213.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ummmm... Yes. The boss of The Moles is true to her word!

:{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 241.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Fight Club?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought the first rule was...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 242.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...You don't talk about it...
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 215.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Is this more secret talk?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That doesn't sound good!
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 243.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No kidding, they didn't exactly get off on the right foot.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 244.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, where is the Fight Club? Can you show us the way?
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 216.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hmm~ But it's an obvious building, grown-ups are just useless~
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 217.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Come with Hook, I'll take you over.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 245.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Thanks, o great one.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 218.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That's Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, to you! Who said you could shorten my title!?

;(Talk to Hook)
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 227.ogg}} '''Hook:''' There are so many people here &mdash; Hook's too short. I can't see anything...
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 228.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Wha&mdash;! When did you... D&mdash;Did you hear what Hook was saying?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a single word.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 229.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Good. Hook didn't say anything, and you didn't hear it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a single word about you saying you're too short.
::{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 230.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hehe, good. Wait a second... You did too hear everything Hook was saying!
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 231.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hmph, grown-up fights are less fun than ours. So what if I can't see!
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 hook 232.ogg}} '''Hook:''' You have to use your fists, palms, and even your fingers in combat! If you don't know how, you're done for! You need to train until your body is an extension of the mind... and the mind is an extension of your will.
:{{A|VO chapter1 2 mar7th 250.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Fists, palms, and fingers... *gasp* Rock, paper, scissors! Phew! No wonder I was confused!
