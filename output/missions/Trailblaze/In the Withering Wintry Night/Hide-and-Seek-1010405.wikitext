===Talk to the unfamiliar woman and find out about what's happening{{subst:void|<!--101040102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Natasha's Clinic|As the daughter of the Supreme Guardian, Bronya has always been quick and decisive &mdash; this pursuit operation targeted at you was no exception.<br />Good thing your "good pal" Sampo arrived just in time to rescue you. It's just that... it would've been better if he didn't knock you out with the smoke bomb made from questionable ingredients.<br />In your daze, you realize that you aren't tied up but placed on a bed somewhere &mdash; to a degree, this tells you that you're not in immediate danger. You'll have to ask the unfamiliar woman in front of you for more details.}}

===Find March 7th and Dan Heng{{subst:void|<!--101040103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Natasha's Clinic|update|The doctor named Natasha explained the entire incident to you. You now know two things:<br />One, Dan Heng has been grabbed by Sampo. And two, March 7th abandoned you to go shopping. As for Bronya... Well, you're not too concerned about the well-being of your enemies right now.<br />Whatever the case, you decide to find your two companions first and have a deep conversation about why they left you behind.}}

===See what March 7th is doing{{subst:void|<!--101040105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|You find March 7th and discover her to be immersed in a children's game and doesn't notice you at all.<br />"Of course," you think. "When a companion is unconscious and the other missing, what better way to resolve it than to 'find a few kids to play games with'?"<br />You've convinced yourself. Now it's the cute March 7th's turn to do the same.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|update|March 7th attempts to convince you but you no longer care for it as much anymore, because the kids have started taunting you.<br />You will not stand for this! It's time to show these children the cruelty of the grown-ups' world.<br />Use your unrivaled and precise hiding skills to teach these kids a lesson!}}

You didn't take a liking to this.}}
