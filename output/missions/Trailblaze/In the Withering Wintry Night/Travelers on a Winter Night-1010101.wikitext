===Search for traces of civilization in the Snow Plains{{subst:void|<!--101010120-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Outlying Snow Plains|You land on Jarilo-VI safely, but now find yourselves standing in frigid winds among barren snowfields stretching as far as the eye can see.<br />Feeling stuck, you recall Himeko's words: Successful trailblazers must learn to explore, understand, establish, and connect... Maybe this is what exploring looks like.<br />In any event, your options are now clear: Push through the snow or wait for the Stellaron to miraculously appear by itself.}}

===Investigate the strange snow drift{{subst:void|<!--101010109-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Outlying Snow Plains|update|Your group has landed on Jarilo-VI safely, but now find yourselves standing in cold wind among barren snowfields stretching as far as the eye can see.<br />Feeling stuck, you recall Himeko's words: Successful trailblazers must learn to explore, understand, establish, and connect... Maybe this is what exploring looks like.<br />You are surprised by a wriggling snow drift in this silvery world.<br />What else could be more alluring than a moving snow drift? You decide to approach and investigate.}}

===Follow Sampo and head towards Belobog{{subst:void|<!--101010110-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Outlying Snow Plains|update|You discover a shivering man who buried himself in the snow drift. If he wasn't looking to take a good nap in the blistering cold then this smiling man is probably trying to hide from something... something other than the few of you.<br />After knowing more about each of you, he offers to bring you to Belobog &mdash; the only human settlement on the surface of this planet. You will most definitely find clues regarding the Stellaron there.}}

===Follow Gepard Landau to the Guardian's residence{{subst:void|<!--101020101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|The bad news is that your buddy Sampo has abandoned you and left you to deal with Gepard Landau, the Silvermane Guard Captain, alone. The good news, however, is that the imposing soldier is actually quite flexible.<br />You successfully persuade Gepard by making him believe that you are from a world beyond the sky. He promises to escort you to the Supreme Guardian at Belobog.<br />Everything looked perfect... There's no reason for doubt, all you have to do is follow the Silvermane Guards.}}
