===Meet up with companions and Oleg===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|Natasha tells you that March 7th and Dan Heng are with Oleg, the chief of Wildfire. Seems like your companions have been busy with work during your time away...<br />At least they didn't leave you behind and go play hide-and-seek or earn a little pocket money at the boxing gym this time...<br />Anyways, head out and meet up with your companions and see how their work is going.}}
