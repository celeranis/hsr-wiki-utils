===Rest in the Goethe Hotel{{subst:void|<!--101020201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Hotel Corridor|After an entire day of sightseeing, you've got a complete understanding of the local culture and are just an appointment at Belobog's Administrative Department away from becoming its actual citizens.<br />You return to the Goethe Hotel. The warm Geomarrow lights and the tea fragrance in the air make you feel at ease.<br />There's still some time to walk around the hotel before washing up and getting ready for bed. It seems like March 7th and Dan Heng also wants to speak with you &mdash; arrange your time before sleeping as you wish.}}
