===Give the supplies to Natasha{{subst:void|<!--101080101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|You come to an agreement: Give Clara half of the painkillers to take back for the vagrants.<br />Even though Natasha isn't the type of person to lose her mind over something like this, you still feel a little bad and troubled...<br />How will Natasha react to this? Guess you'll have to ask her personally to find out.}}

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 201.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Nat! We're back.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 201.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hehe, that's our Seele. Nothing if not punctual. So, did you find any usable supplies?

:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 202.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Let me see... metal plates, gauze bandages, painkillers, rubbing alcohol... Perfect, that's everything I needed.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 203.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Huh... It's just, there are less painkillers than I'd expected. Did someone break into the storage room?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We shared some with Clara.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 204.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Clara?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Monsters had destroyed some of them.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 202.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hey, no need to lie, Nat wouldn't be upset about what we did.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 203.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Clara had already arrived at the storage room by the time we got there. We split the painkillers with her.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 205.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...If she was there too then... I understand. She wants to look after the injured vagrants, right? Clara's always been a kind-hearted girl...
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 206.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I think you made the right decision. Still, it means I'm going to have to draw up a detailed dosage plan.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 204.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hey, don't worry. I'll help you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 207.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Um, no need. I'll handle the clinic. I assume you three have more important things to be getting on with, right? Oleg will be waiting, not to mention your two companions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd nearly forgotten about those two.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 bronya 201.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' So you guys aren't that close after all? I thought you were sworn friends.
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 208 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 208 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Haha, you're adorable, Bronya. (Trailblazer) was obviously joking~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I forgot to say anything to them before I left...
::{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 209.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I'm sure they won't mind, they seemed in good spirits.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 205.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I bet old Oleg wants to talk about Svarog. We should get going &mdash; sorry Nat, we'll have to leave the wounded to you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 natasha 210.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' No worries, I hope things go smoothly.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 205.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So you're not the guide Mr. Oleg was talking about, Seele?
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 210.ogg}} '''Seele:''' No, Oleg didn't assign that to me. But I've got a pretty good idea who it's gonna be.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 206.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I guess Sampo. Businessman, magician, liar, and now guide... This kind of work was made for him.
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 207.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh... Hm...
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 211.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...You okay over there?
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 mar7th 208.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's nothing, it just feels like people are getting along better since your unannounced disappearance...
