{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|On the first night of the trailblazing expedition, you don't sleep as soundly and at ease as you did on the Express.<br />It's not because you have some kind of close bond with the Express but because you keep hearing the sound of troops moving around as you sleep.<br />And now, you can hear frantic door-knocking &mdash; your instincts tell you that something's not right... Go and investigate.}}
