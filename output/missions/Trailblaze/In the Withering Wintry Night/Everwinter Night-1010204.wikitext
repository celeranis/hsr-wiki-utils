===Investigate the commotion outside the hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|On the first night of the trailblazing expedition, you don't sleep as soundly and at ease as you did on the Express.<br />It's not because you have some kind of close bond with the Express but because you keep hearing the sound of troops moving around as you sleep.<br />And now, you can hear frantic door-knocking &mdash; your instincts tell you that something's not right... Go and investigate.}}

===Confront the Silvermane Guards outside the hotel===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|On the first night of the trailblazing expedition, you don't sleep as soundly and at ease as you did on the Express.<br />It's not because you have some kind of close bond with the Express but because you keep hearing the sound of troops moving around as you sleep.<br />And now, you know exactly where the noise is coming from &mdash; it's undoubtedly the doing of the noble-looking girl and her troops in front of you.<br />They don't seem to be friendly. Go and ask them what they want.}}

===Find a way to leave the Fragmentum and shake off the pursuers===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Backwater Pass|update|You rush into the Fragmentum to avoid getting caught. How come things went downhill so quickly? March 7th has no clue &mdash; she's written as an innocent and sweet teenage girl after all.<br />Despite the initial shock, you quickly agree on the course of action: Find the way out of the Fragmentum first. Everything else can wait.}}
