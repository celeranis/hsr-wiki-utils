:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' After all those millennia... is this what Jarilo-VI has become?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 129.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? So that snowy planet is our destination this time?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Yes... Looks like this trailblazing expedition won't be easy.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 105.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Spatial readout anomaly! Star rail stability is down to 12%!
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 106.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Schedule alteration: Seven-day stopover time extended indefinitely!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Anomaly?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The complex locality of this world has been... affected somehow. The star rail has been blocked off by something.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Take an ordinary train as an example: It's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 108.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Indefinitely?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 107.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Indefinitely. Until the anomaly is removed!
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 109.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Take an ordinary train as an example: It's like the tracks up ahead have suddenly snapped, and the way forward leads straight into a collapsing abyss...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 110.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The only sensible thing to do would be to brake hard, right?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 108.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' If we try to force our way ahead, there could be a hefty price to pay!
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 130.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' This again... Don't tell me, it's gotta be...
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The results of the preliminary analysis are here &mdash; the anomaly stems from a Stellaron, as always.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stellaron...
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 105 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Yes, (Trailblazer) &mdash; just like the one that's been placed into your body.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What should we do...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 111.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Don't worry. It's not the first time our route has been obstructed by a Stellaron.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 112.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Stellarons are clouded in mystery &mdash; even Herta isn't able to fully understand them... but at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What exactly is a Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 113.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Stellarons are clouded in mystery &mdash; even Herta isn't able to fully understand them...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 114.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But there's no need to worry &mdash; this isn't the first time our route has been obstructed by a Stellaron. Even if we don't know much about them, at least we know how to neutralize their influences.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The only thing we can say for sure is that their arrival causes massive changes to civilizations and ecosystems. They also generate distortions in space such as Fragmentums.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' There must be an inextricable connection between the Stellaron we're dealing with here, and Jarilo-VI becoming a frozen planet.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 115.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Our current theory is that Stellarons are seeds of disaster planted by a certain Aeon throughout the universe. We can't continue to trailblaze without removing the source of the disaster.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you're saying...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That we've gotta get busy!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why can't the people in the worlds affected save themselves?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's empowering, looking out at a world from a window like this...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...but when you set foot on the planet itself, you realize how small and helpless you really are &mdash; just like them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So we're like a chivalrous band of cosmic knights!
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right! You finally get what we're all about. Pretty cool, huh?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 116 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 116 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' (Trailblazer), I'd like to entrust this trailblazing expedition to March, Dan Heng, and you.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 117.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The objective is clear: Find the Stellaron responsible for the disaster and the spatial distortions, and bring it back to the Express. We'll deal with the rest.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 133 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 133 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Awesome! We get to work as a team again, (Trailblazer)!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not coming?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 118.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Someone has to stay on the train, or Pom-Pom will get lonely.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 119.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Not to mention, {{Rubi|Nanook|The Destruction}} threw us a glance just now. If we're targeted by the Antimatter Legion, then things could go south fast.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why us?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Because you three made a great team back in the space station. My guess is that if you spend even longer together, we'll see something even more impressive.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm kinda sleepy...
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 134.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! That's not the spirit!

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' A planet covered in snow and ice... Will I find my answer here...?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 136.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' WHOA! Don't sneak up on me like that!
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 137.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why are you still here? Go find Dan Heng! Exciting adventures are waiting for us.

;(Talk to Dan Heng)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Are you doing okay after your first jump?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Dizziness or retching are normal reactions. You'll feel better once you get used to it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel fine.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So you have high compatibility with the Express. That's good.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why aren't you with everyone else?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I enjoy being alone, especially when I have important work to do.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I went through the Express' database, and it seems the environment on Jarilo-VI has undergone drastic changes in the past few centuries. It was not a frozen planet to begin with...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Welt says it was caused by a Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' He said so? Hmm... considering the spatial obstacles that the star rail has encountered, it's highly possible.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I've conducted a preliminary survey and found that there's one area with a relatively normal temperature on the surface of the planet. By "normal," I mean a temperature that just about allows for human survival.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 108.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' If I had to choose a site for initial investigation on this trailblazing expedition, that would be it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Himeko wants you, me, and March 7th to go together.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 109.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...As I expected. Before you came, whenever March wanted to go anywhere, Himeko would make Mr. Yang and me go with her.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 110.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' And even after you arrived, I didn't suppose I'd be the one to be liberated of that duty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't you and March 7th go?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 111.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' If I know Himeko, she's not gonna let you stay behind.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 112.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You're new, I'm sure she wants to get you started with some firsthand trailblazing.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 113.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Don't worry. With March around, you are guaranteed an eventful expedition.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 114.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I assume the trailblazing objective this time is to find the Stellaron on Jarilo-VI and dispel the effect it's exerting on the star rail... right?
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 115 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 115 f.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I see. (Trailblazer), you should find March. I'll join you two once I'm ready.

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 124.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. Now the Express is relying on you to get it moving again.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 125.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Remember, there are four things we do when we arrive at a new world: Explore, understand, establish, and connect.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 126.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' And I'm sure you'll get along really well with March and Dan Heng.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 111.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Ever since the Destruction sowed Stellarons across the universe, many worlds have changed.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Nanook the Destruction, Yaoshi the Abundance, Terminus the Finality... I've seen and learned a lot in my time, but I still struggle to understand some of the Aeons' actions.

;(Talk to Pom-Pom)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 109.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Each stop brings its own grand and exciting adventure!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you been on an adventure before, Pom-Pom?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 110.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' No...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you been to Jarilo-VI before, Pom-Pom?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 111.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' No.
