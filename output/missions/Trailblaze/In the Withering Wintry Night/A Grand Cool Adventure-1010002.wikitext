{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|You board the Astral Express and become acquainted with a group of companions who may not always get along, but are all at least friendly.<br />A journey with an unknown destination between the stars is about to begin. Maybe you really did accidentally stumble upon some set of a Sci-Fi movie.<br />Conductor Pom-Pom announces that the warp jump is about to begin &mdash; seeing that you're still new to interstellar travel, best you find a seat and hang on tight.}}

:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Dizziness or retching are normal reactions. You'll feel better once you get used to it.

:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I went through the Express' database, and it seems the environment on Jarilo-VI has undergone drastic changes in the past few centuries. It was not a frozen planet to begin with...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Welt says it was caused by a Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' He said so? Hmm... considering the spatial obstacles that the star rail has encountered, it's highly possible.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I've conducted a preliminary survey and found that there's one area with a relatively normal temperature on the surface of the planet. By "normal," I mean a temperature that just about allows for human survival.

:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 124.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Thanks to a brilliant performance, you guys saved the space station from a moment of crisis. Now the Express is relying on you to get it moving again.
