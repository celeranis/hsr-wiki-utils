===Sit on the sofa and wait for the warp jump{{subst:void|<!--101000201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|You board the Astral Express and become acquainted with a group of companions who may not always get along, but are all at least friendly.<br />A journey with an unknown destination between the stars is about to begin. Maybe you really did accidentally stumble upon some set of a Sci-Fi movie.<br />Conductor Pom-Pom announces that the warp jump is about to begin &mdash; seeing that you're still new to interstellar travel, best you find a seat and hang on tight.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|The Express runs aground in the outer space of a white planet. According to Himeko, the effects of the Stellaron are what's obstructing the Express' path forward.<br />If you wish to continue the journey, you must clear out the obstruction caused by the Stellaron.<br />Himeko wants you to talk to Dan Heng and hopes the three of you can team up to complete this trailblazing expedition on Jarilo-VI.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Outlying Snow Plains|update|You land on Jarilo-VI safely, but now find yourselves standing in frigid winds among barren snowfields stretching as far as the eye can see.<br />Feeling stuck, you recall Himeko's words: Successful trailblazers must learn to explore, understand, establish, and connect... Maybe this is what exploring looks like.<br />In any event, your options are now clear: Push through the snow or wait for the Stellaron to miraculously appear by itself.}}
