===Find the guide arranged by Wildfire{{subst:void|<!--101080103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|It seems Wildfire has finally sided with the Nameless due to March 7th and Dan Heng's mediation. Now, your goals are crystal clear: Do your best in diplomacy with Svarog and if all fails, Wildfire will be ready for battle.<br />To reach your goals, Oleg has arranged a guide for the crew. You probably already know who the guide is going to be...<br />However, the person waiting for you at the designated location doesn't seem to be the dark blue silhouette that you were expecting. Instead, it's some sort of black chaos avatar...}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 5 seele 213.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Alright, alright, don't get started. But I wanna ask you something: Everyone in Wildfire knows the location of Svarog's lair. Why do we need you as a guide?
:{{A|VO chapter1 5 sampo 204.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' *sigh* My specialties in the field, perhaps? Wildfire may know where the base is, but have they ever been inside?
