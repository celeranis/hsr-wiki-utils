{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|According to Natasha, there may still be remaining medical supplies in the abandoned Rivet Town. The mission for you and Seele is to retrieve the supplies and deplete them of their final value... Erm, to let them shine and be useful in the clinic.<br />Seele seems to have spent her entire childhood there... So this mission may hold a special value to her.<br />The industrial town is just north of Boulder Town. Set out with everyone once you're packed up and ready.}}

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 218 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 218 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer). If we hadn't run into you two, Seele would've had to venture into the Fragmentum on her own.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 220.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I know it's not her first rodeo, but the thought of her taking on those horrid monsters... I can't help but worry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You seem to care about her a lot.
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 221.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Well, she grew up before my eyes after all. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think she can handle it.
::{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 222.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I know, but she grew up before my eyes after all. I don't want anything bad to happen to her.
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 223.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Seele has been like this since she was little &mdash; impulsive and eager to be the best. For people who don't know her, they might find her... difficult...
:{{A|VO chapter1 4 natasha 224.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But you can trust her, even with your life. Stick around a bit longer and you'll see what I mean.
