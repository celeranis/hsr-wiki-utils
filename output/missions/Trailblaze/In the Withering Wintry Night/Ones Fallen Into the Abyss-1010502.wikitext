{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 201.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hey, you came. That was fast.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is Wildfire doing in the mine?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What trouble has Wildfire gotten into?
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 202.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Didn't I tell you? *sigh* Long story short &mdash;
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 203.ogg}} '''Seele:''' The underground used to have many mines. However, in recent years, some sort of corrosion called the "Fragmentum" started to spread. It's ruined a lot of mines.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 204.ogg}} '''Seele:''' The one we're heading into is relatively unaffected. A bunch of vagrants made it their home after their old turf was consumed by the Fragmentum. Actually, most of them are pretty honest folks...
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 205.ogg}} '''Seele:''' But with such a large group, it's inevitable that troublemakers will find their way in. They've been stealing from the miners and picking fights. And that's not the worst of it.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 206.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Things are much more serious this time... For two days now, huge clashes have been breaking out between the miners and the vagrants. It isn't pretty.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 207.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Mines are our lifelines in the Underworld. We have to keep providing Geomarrow to the Overworld in exchange for supplies.
:{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 208.ogg}} '''Seele:''' In order to quell the situation, Chief Oleg brought Wildfire into the mine and left me in charge of security for the towns. But the situation in the mine is critical &mdash; I have to back him up.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I don't think I understood, can you go over it again?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Understood, let's go.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 215.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Oh, as for you... the Chief will decide your fate when we see him.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 bronya 201.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Good, I've been wanting to come face to face with the leader of the Underworld.
::{{A|VO chapter1 3 seele 216.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hmph, you're about to come face to face with reality.
