:{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 102.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' She's temporarily taken on the general's responsibilities. Before meeting you, she must make the current situation known and fortify public spirit. This is her first real test as a general &mdash; I hope she can get used to things quickly.
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 101.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' ...I don't think I can ever get used to this.
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 102.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' *sigh* It's a pleasure to see you all here today.
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 103.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Collating casualties and losses, dispatching forces to round up the remnants of the Disciples, submitting battle reports to the Six Charioteers... Now I know what Jing Yuan meant when he said "the highest throne faces the strongest winds."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But you're enjoying yourself, right?
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 104.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Generalship is no trifling matter &mdash; how could I be "enjoying myself?" All I can do is get used to it, hmph...

::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 103.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' The Ambrosial Arbor is dormant. Thanks to everyone's hard-fought battles, the Luofu is safe once more.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 104.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Before he left, the general told me to handle things at the Seat of Divine Foresight. Fortunately, now that victory has been achieved, the plans we prepared will never see the light of day. However...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 105.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' The general did order that if he were unable to return to duty, then the master diviner would take over his duties temporarily.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Is the general okay?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 106.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Alas, I'm no healer, I'm afraid I couldn't say.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 107.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I ordered a military doctor to provide the most comprehensive emergency treatment they could. The Alchemy Commission was caught up in the Sanctus Medicus conspiracy &mdash; it took a lot of work to find someone trustworthy enough to heal the general.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' If we can help, don't hesitate to ask. I don't know much about medicine, but... there are lots of ways to seal wounds and prevent injuries from worsening.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 108.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Don't worry, long-life species are resilient and strong &mdash; the general will pull through. He's faced down situations a hundred times more dangerous than this.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you plan on doing with the Ambrosial Arbor?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 109.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' What do we plan on doing... *sigh* Thousands of years ago, the Xianzhou Alliance was at its wit's end trying to deal with it. Today, nothing's changed.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 110.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' The Arbor was resurrected. Aside from the Arbiter's Lux Arrow, I'm afraid that nothing can materially harm it. We might be able to suppress it with the help of the Vidyadhara, but with internal strife ravaging their ranks, I'm afraid it's a long shot...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' If you can locate exactly where the Stellaron is within the Arbor, then the Express might be able to help out.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 111.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Thank you for your kind offer, Mr. Yang. But something as important and fundamental as the Ambrosial Arbor will require a meeting and deliberation from the Six Charioteers.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Exit}} Fu Xuan seems to be handling things pretty well...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 112.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Better to wait until the master diviner has another twenty or thirty years under her belt.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 113.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Subduing the enemy is one of the most minor parts of a general's work. They have to meet with the Luofu's Six Charioteers and undergo Ten-Lords Commission inspections &mdash; all while dealing with the Xianzhou Alliance's top brass...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 114.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' None of it is easy to navigate, but it's a daily responsibility. The crown of a general sits heavy on the head indeed.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 8 qingzu 115.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I almost forgot &mdash; I need to gather data for the master diviner's draft report. Bye for now.

:{{A|VO chapter2 8 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Seriously? Thanking us like that, and then immediately sending us on another mission?
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 109.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' It's not a mission. The Stellaron crisis, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus rebellion, the Arbor's resurrection, not to mention the Antimatter Legion infiltrating the Luofu... All of these incidents need reporting at the highest level for investigation.
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 110.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' ...It's just that, having been in the middle of everything, I'm struggling to keep an accurate perspective. I would appreciate if you could go through it all with me, so that I can reacquaint myself with the finer detail.
:{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 111.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' So, where should we begin?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's discuss Phantylia first...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 112.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' It appears that Phantylia was the mastermind behind it all. The Xianzhou warred with the Antimatter Legion in the past, and ever since we have kept a watchful eye on their movements.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 113.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Few could have foreseen the insidious tactics employed in the execution of their assaults. The Lord Ravager slithered in unnoticed, clandestinely plotting and machinating, and surreptitiously bestowed a Stellaron upon the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. This heinous act instigated an uprising aimed at luring the Luofu into a perilous trap of self-destruction.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 114.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' The present danger posed by the Legion clearly demands a re-evaluation. We should proceed cautiously.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's talk about the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 115.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' When the Ambrosial Arbor was severed by the Reignbow Arbiter thousands of years ago, the Abundance became a taboo. Those within the Alchemy Commission &mdash; the original masters of the so-called "way of immortality" &mdash; were ruined at a stroke. The commission became a shadow of its former self.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 116.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Presumably, from that moment on, the seeds of discord for the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus had already been planted... Some of them were willing to work with the enemy, acquiring a Stellaron from the Antimatter Legion to try and revive {{Rubi|the Abundance|Ambrosial Arbor}}.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 117.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Hmm... They succeeded alright, but why would Phantylia's objective be to realize their wishes? Those traitors gained nothing &mdash; they betrayed the Xianzhou only to become sacrificial offerings in the Lord Ravager's grand scheme.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's discuss the Stellaron Hunters...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 118.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' The Stellaron Hunters? We know just as little. But in the Matrix of Prescience, I saw a prophecy that Kafka received from {{Rubi|Destiny's Slave|Elio}}. Elio foresaw all manner of possibilities for the Luofu...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 119.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Based on what Kafka knows, and despite everything being under the control of Elio, that prophecy is indeed the most beneficial future for the Luofu. The Stellaron Hunters walked right into our trap, and even gifted allies &mdash; in the form of yourselves &mdash; to the Xianzhou... That might sound self-interested, but I hope the feeling is mutual.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 120.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Now that future has come true, the Xianzhou has discovered the Legion's intentions, and with everyone's help, has imposed a crushing defeat on Phantylia.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I think we already have the gist...
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 121.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' That we may, but as logical as things might seem, there are still many details about which we're uncertain.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 122.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' For example, how was the Stellaron brought onto the Xianzhou? And who sent it on to Scalegorge Waterscape? How many Disciples of Sanctus Medicus still remain at large? All of this is a mystery. Thus far, we've done our best.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 123.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' I'm submitting my written report to the Alliance, and I've already got a plan in mind. All of you will feature in the report, but for the sake of Jing Yuan, anything related to Xianzhou internal affairs will have names redacted &mdash; I hope you can forgive me.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I was about to make the same request, Master Diviner. Since the Arbor's resurrection, I'm sure the Alliance will be poring over every detail of the report. I fear that if the Astral Express gets dragged into matters, leaving will not be an easy task.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 124.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Mm. Jing Yuan has committed quite a few violations this time around, and I'll have to deal with them one by one... *sigh* The Cloud Knight generals are all such a hassle.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 125.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Before you leave, please make time to recuperate. If there's anywhere you'd like to visit, feel free to take a look. I must attend to some Cloud Knight matters &mdash; farewell for now.
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 126.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Oh &mdash; if you pass through Starskiff Haven, I have something that I hope you can give to Yukong.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Something Miss Tingyun left behind?
::{{A|VO chapter2 8 fuxuan 127.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' *sigh* It was all so chaotic. When Phantylia took form, it was as if Tingyun vanished into thin air.
