How will you not startle the Silvermane Guards and make it to your destination once you've gotten past the door?<br />To be totally honest, you have no idea. All you can do now is to place your hope in the lady genius next to you.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 306.ogg}} '''Serval:''' With the front line on high alert, they must have rotated the bridge to make it impassable. Then they cut off the energy supply to the terminals to avoid accidental repositioning... or to prevent deserters from escaping.
