===Go to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone with Serval{{subst:void|<!--101110100-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|After avoiding the watchful eyes of the Silvermane Guards, you finally arrive at the entrance to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. One step further and you will be inside the most heavily guarded military zone in all of Belobog.<br />Will you be able to successfully make it through the gate of the restricted zone? How will you not startle the Silvermane Guards and make it to your destination once you've gotten past the door?<br />To be totally honest, you have no idea. All you can do now is to place your hope in the lady genius next to you.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|update|After avoiding the watchful eye of the Silvermane Guard, you finally arrive at the entrance to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. The Silvermane Guards here are armed to the teeth and hostile. In comparison, the Silvermane Guards patrolling the city appear to be extremely lazy...<br />However, you notice that they seem significantly less hostile after seeing Serval.<br />Perhaps this will allow you to turn the tide.
