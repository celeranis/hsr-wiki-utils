:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 219.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' When the sentry reported to me, I thought there must have been a misunderstanding. The enemy alarm had to be unrelated to your entry into the restricted zone &mdash; perhaps the intruders had taken you hostage. And yet...
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 220.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Step away from the intruders, Serval. Walk over slowly and stand behind me. You're different from them.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 361.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I'm sorry... we have an understanding. I stand with them.

:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 223.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Have you forgotten where we are? We Landaus ought to know this place better than anywhere... The outer reaches of the front line against the Fragmentum, Belobog's most strategic protective fortress.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 224.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Every Silvermane Guard here, every person here, is ready to sacrifice themselves, ready to spill their blood for Belobog at a moment's notice...
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 225.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Yet here you are leading fugitives into the restricted zone, attacking my Silvermane comrades-in-arms, hijacking the energy hub... Are you really worthy of the Landau name?
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 364.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Why do you think I've come here? We've found a way to dispel the Eternal Freeze, to seal the Fragmentum. It might be the only lifeline this world has left!
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 226.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' If that were true, why wouldn't you report to Madam Cocolia? Why would you sneak into the restricted zone and create chaos!?
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 365.ogg}} '''Serval:''' You don't understand. The one preventing us from getting close to the truth... is Cocolia herself.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 227.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...You have all seen the supreme guardian in person. Do you think you can act as you please because she didn't recognize your version of events!?
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 366.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Listen to me, Gepard! The origin and spread of the Fragmentum is linked to the Stellaron. The meteorite in the Architects' records, it's&mdash;
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 228.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I know about the Stellaron. It's exactly what the fugitives behind you are seeking. But the Madam Guardian has already revealed the truth to me! These people have ulterior motives, Serval. They want to steal this treasure from the Architects.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 229.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The Madam Guardian has warned me before that you were indulging in fantasy, that you'd been exposed to forbidden knowledge, and that you would bring destruction down upon Belobog... I believe you, Serval, I believe you think you're acting with loyalty to the people! It's just...
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 gepard 230.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Guards, formation! Arrest these people. We could be inundated with Fragmentum monsters at any moment, we have no time to waste on them!
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 367.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The forbidden is only forbidden to conceal the truth within.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 368.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Cocolia's afraid that we'll seize on this knowledge &mdash; that the truth will spread far and wide: To save the world, we must risk it all.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 369.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I've said my piece, whether you believe it or not is up to you. Regardless, you should know by now your sister's never been one to back down. If there's something or someone you can't abide, you should stand up and resist... and if there's something you uphold, you should uphold it to the very end!

:{{DIcon|Talk}} So this is how brothers and sisters normally coexist?
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 381.ogg}} '''Serval:''' What's wrong with a bit of violent coexistence between siblings? Seems pretty normal to me.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 382.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Hehe, I'm pulling your leg. Since I left the military, my brother and I have always steered clear of certain sensitive topics... Thinking about it, perhaps he's just been looking out for my feelings, shielding me all along.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 383.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Knowing my temper, my brother almost certainly went to great lengths on many occasions for me. I should be thanking him.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} We've got this.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 387.ogg}} '''Serval:''' As I mentioned, if we want to progress further north, we're gonna have to cross that "hell." Still, look at it this way: Just another arena to showcase our skills, right?
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 serval 388.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Now, if you're ready to get on stage, let's push for that standing ovation!

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 227.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I gotta admit, I had a lot of... misunderstandings... about the Silvermane Guards. They're fighting for survival here every day, just like Wildfire.
:{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 228.ogg}} '''Seele:''' The difference is we're making a stand for freedom... while they're just carrying out orders.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} That's why we have to try and put ourselves in their shoes.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 229.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Put ourselves in their shoes... Easier said than done. Everyone has their struggles, but how can we understand them if we can't even see each other?

::{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 230.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Of course I do, I've understood them for a while now. But as far as I can tell, she doesn't need other people's understanding. She needs to understand her own heart.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 231.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...It's the same with Gepard. I could tell it took a lot for him to lay down his arms.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} It's time to finish this.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 232.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I think I can already hear the storm on the other side of the city walls... Not a reassuring sound.
::{{A|VO chapter1 7 seele 233.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I hope Serval's right... That supreme lunatic better not have harmed Bronya.

;(Talk to Dunn)
:'''Dunn:''' Alright, what would you like to chat about?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I heard you also do a bit of rock and roll?
::'''Dunn:''' Haha, it all happened when I was still in cadet school... Although we were reserve officers, we were still students at the end of the day. So we needed some after-school hobbies to spend our excess energy.
::'''Dunn:''' I formed a rock band with a few like-minded friends, which was quite famous in the cadet school back then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who was in your band?
::'''Dunn:''' Serval, she's our guitarist and lead singer. She was absolutely charming and talented. She totally deserved her position.
::'''Dunn:''' I was her keyboardist... and the two of us always worked quite well together. I always felt like we were... Ahem, nothing.
::'''Dunn:''' The next one is the drummer &mdash; this one will shock you! Do you want to guess who it is? Here's a hint &mdash; they're also a member of the Silvermane Guards.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Gepard?
:::'''Dunn:''' Uh... he's a high-ranking officer in the Guards for sure, but he doesn't get along with his sister.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Pela?
:::'''Dunn:''' What a guess! She didn't tell you beforehand, did she?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Cocolia?
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Be careful with your words, outsider!
::'''Dunn:''' The correct answer is Pela. Hard to believe, right? The petite, meticulous intelligence officer is actually a drummer in a rock band... I guess there's too much pressure on the job?
::'''Dunn:''' I heard that Pela and Serval still do band practice and live performances together regularly, just like old times...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There were only three of you in the band?
::'''Dunn:''' No, I remember there was another person... Who was it again? I can't believe it, I actually can't remember who it was...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Doesn't a rock band need a bass player?
:::'''Dunn:''' Ah&mdash;yes, yes, the bass player! I just remembered it after hearing it from you. Haha...but what was his name again? Wait, was the bass player a guy or a girl...
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Eh, never mind. I just can't remember. Don't worry about that person, it's not important.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know much about rock bands, sorry.
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Eh, never mind. I just can't remember. Don't worry about that person, it's not important.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You and Serval...
::'''Dunn:''' ...
::'''Dunn:''' It's history already. Sometimes letting go is the best choice...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of job did you do in the military?
::'''Dunn:''' I am responsible for the general management of the support lines in the restricted zone. Munitions, logistics, energy... all of these are under my control.
::'''Dunn:''' I am also responsible for direct communication with the front line. If the front line was breached... my boys and I would have to form the last line of defense to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the city.
::{{DIcon|Return}} That sounds dangerous.
:::'''Dunn:''' Fortunately, we have Captain Gepard... So things like that have never happened.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Return}} That doesn't sound very dangerous.
:::'''Dunn:''' It's all thanks to Captain Gepard... At least so far, there has never been a record of a Fragmentum monster getting out of the restricted zone.
