===Return to the surface===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|The longer you stay in this giant underground space, the harder it is to differentiate between the cold rock ceiling and the sky.<br />It's time to return to the surface... But you wouldn't be able to without any help &mdash; because if you could, you would've already done so, isn't that right?<br />The members of Wildfire extends Bronya's greetings to you and are willing to guide you... But you can't be too picky about the guide.<br />Prepare yourself mentally and leave with Sampo.}}
