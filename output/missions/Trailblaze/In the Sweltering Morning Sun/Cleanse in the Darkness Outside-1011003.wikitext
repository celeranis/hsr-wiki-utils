{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Boulder Town|The longer you stay in this giant underground space, the harder it is to differentiate between the cold rock ceiling and the sky.<br />It's time to return to the surface... But you wouldn't be able to without any help &mdash; because if you could, you would've already done so, isn't that right?<br />The members of Wildfire extends Bronya's greetings to you and are willing to guide you... But you can't be too picky about the guide.<br />Prepare yourself mentally and leave with Sampo.}}

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 224.ogg}} '''Seele:''' You ready yet? If you want to keep wasting time, I'll just go on ahead by myself.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 225.ogg}} '''Seele:''' What, still something you want to talk about? Alright, let's make it quick.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Did Bronya say anything to you?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 226.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Not much. We just chatted a bit.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Care to elaborate?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 227.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...It really isn't worth going into.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 228.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I promised her that I would help her rebuild the connection between the Overworld and the Underworld, that's all.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can tell something's weighing on your mind...
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 229.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...Is it that obvious?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 230.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I made a promise to Bronya that if something were to happen to her, I'd rescue her myself.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Looking forward to this journey?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 231.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hmm... I didn't really give it much thought. But traveling with you bunch does always lead to unexpected surprises.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 232.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Hearty combat and exciting adventures... Not bad, I certainly don't hate it.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you said goodbye to everyone?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 233.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Of course... Heh, you didn't see the look on Joshua's face. He could barely hold back his tears.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 234.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Chief Oleg... He didn't say much, but I know he's not the kind to wear his heart on his sleeve.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 235.ogg}} '''Seele:''' It was my choice to go up, and Natasha supported my decision. Besides, you could use another person who can fight, right?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all for now.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 seele 236.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Alright, then let's cut the chat and move out!

;(Talk to Oleg)
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 208 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 208 f.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Ah, young {{MC|f=lady|m=lad}}. I wanted to see you off, but you know how things are around here in the underground. Solve one problem and three more take its place.
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 209.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hm, something you wanted to ask?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About you and Natasha...
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 210.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Natasha trusts me. In her eyes, an ex-military officer was more suited to be the leader of the organization than a doctor.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 211.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' But the most important thing a leader needs is a strong heart. An ability to unite everyone toward a common cause. In that respect, no one in the underground comes close to her.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I heard you came from the Overworld.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 212.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' I was actually once an officer of the Silvermane Guards. After being discharged due to an injury, I followed my old lady here to the Underworld, where I planned to retire.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 213.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' But as things would have it, I ended up busier than ever.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you regret it?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 214.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' There is nothing to regret! Life in the Underworld is hard, but people here are kind and everyone is close like one big family.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you miss the old days in the Overworld?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 215.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Do I miss it? If you're talking about the time with my comrades-in-arms, of course. But other than that, I don't really prefer it over life in the Underworld.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's next for Wildfire?
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 216.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Wildfire has already made it through its darkest days. With Natasha's leadership, we have the confidence to lead the Underworlders to a brighter future.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 217.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' And much of that is thanks to all of you.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any more questions.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 218.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Fortunately, Svarog turned out to have some useful information for you. After all your hard work, I'd feel quite guilty if you left empty-handed. Hahaha!
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 oleg 219.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' While you still have a long journey ahead, I have no doubt our paths will cross again one day. Till we meet again, friends of Wildfire!

;(Talk to Sampo)
:{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 211.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Well my friends, are you ready to head out?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 212.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Wonderful! Remember to bring enough food and drink to refuel on the way. We have a lot of steps to climb!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hold on, I have a question.
::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 213.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Ask away, my friend. I have all the answers you seek.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about Gepard Landau.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 214.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' What else is there to say? You know him as well as I do. He's an upstanding guy, as well as young, handsome, and charming in his lack of charm.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 215.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' But to be honest, I'm not very close to him. After all, he's an officer and I'm... the opposite.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about Serval Landau.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 216.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Oh, she's quite extraordinary. The renowned rebellious Landau girl. She once had a bright future, but after getting on her leader's bad side, she lost her job. She ended up opening a workshop and playing underground music.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 217.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' I heard that her old man was furious, and that only a few younger siblings are still in contact with her.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 218.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' I used to go to her sometimes when I had any mechanical problems above ground. But for... various reasons, I don't visit her workshop much anymore.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about the Furnace Core.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 219.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' It's a passage connecting the Underworld and the Overworld, a big, stone, spiral stairway. Y'know, I don't understand the Architects' obsession with making these steps when there is such advanced technology available. Wouldn't an elevator have been better?
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 220.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' ...It's easier for you youngsters. For this old guy, the steps of the Furnace Core are a nightmare on the knees!
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about yourself.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 221.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' You haven't heard enough about me, huh? Alright, my name is Sampo Koski. I'm a businessman who stands up for justice in his free time. And no, I don't have it in for you.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have any more questions.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 211.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Well my friends, are you ready to head out?

::::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 212.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Wonderful! Remember to bring enough food and drink to refuel on the way. We have a lot of steps to climb!
:::{{DIcon|Exit}} There's still unfinished business here.
::::{{A|VO chapter1 6 sampo 222.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' What's the matter? Got too attached to the underground? Go ahead, I'll be waiting here.
