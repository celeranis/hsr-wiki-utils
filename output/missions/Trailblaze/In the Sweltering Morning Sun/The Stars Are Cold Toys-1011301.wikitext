===Venture deeper into the Corridor of Fading Echoes===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|After witnessing the Landau siblings fighting side by side, you truly understand what perseverance and bravery really mean.<br />You just made your way through a fierce battlefield, and now you find yourself inside a Fragmentum maze deafened by silence &mdash; the deathly quiet of this place sends a chill down your spine.<br />Something dangerous seems to lurk in the suffocating air here... All you can do now is to carefully investigate the surroundings while trying to figure out a way to venture deeper into the Fragmentum.}}

===Investigate items discarded on the side of the road===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|After witnessing the Landau siblings fighting side by side, you truly understand what perseverance and bravery really mean.<br />You just made your way through a fierce battlefield and now you find yourself inside a Fragmentum maze deafened by silence &mdash; the deathly quiet of this place sends a chill down your spine.<br />Here, March 7th is showing excellent dexterity never before seen: She notices the strange objects discarded on the roadside that don't seem to belong to this dimension.<br />Although Dan Heng has reminded everyone that the Fragmentum is filled with traps, your nature for adventure tells you that it's necessary to take a closer look.}}

===Catch up to Bronya and Cocolia===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|After witnessing the Landau siblings fighting side by side, you truly understand what perseverance and bravery really mean.<br />You just made your way through a fierce battlefield and now you find yourself inside a Fragmentum maze deafened by silence &mdash; the deathly quiet of this place sends a chill down your spine.<br />March 7th accomplished another feat after discovering the item left behind by Bronya. This time she discovered that the echoing mirages of the guardian mother and daughter have appeared just up ahead.<br />This is undoubtedly a manifestation of the Fragmentum's unique nature of imitating reality &mdash; the two might have been here not long ago. Catch up to them and take a look!}}

===Try to find the switch and open the mechanism gate===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|A giant mechanism gate stops your advance once again.<br />Armed with the experience of dealing with the gear bridge in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone, you quickly realize that if you want to unlock the mechanism in front of you, you'll have to find the device linked to it.<br />These types of devices aren't usually set up very far... Try looking in the area!}}

===Activate all mechanisms===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|A giant mechanism gate stops your advance once again.<br />Armed with the experience of dealing with the gear bridge in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone, you quickly realize that if you want to unlock the mechanism in front of you, you'll have to find the device linked to it.<br />Apparently, there is more than just one device that controls the mechanism gate &mdash; you can't help but think that the sole purpose of this gate is to torture its user...<br />However, complaining won't do you any good. Keep searching for the remaining devices!}}

===Continue further into the Corridor of Fading Echoes===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|After running around in the Fragmentum maze for a long time, you've finally found all the devices and successfully unlocked the mechanism gate.<br />The path to the depths of the maze is wide open once again &mdash; erm, at least you would like to think so.<br />Anyhow, there's no way to tell what obstacles remain in the path ahead. You'll find out when you venture deeper into the Fragmentum.}}

===Defeat the Fragmentum monsters and make your way through the wreckage of the ancient fort===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|Based on the surrounding structures, it's likely that you've arrived in a core area of an ancient citadel that used to stand on the edge of civilization.<br />You can gather yourself here and investigate the trash piles you think may be of value until you lose interest in the history of this place.<br />Your enemies will sit and wait on the path you must take and allow any degree of destruction you may cause here. Then they will be defeated by you and end their meaningless lives.}}

===Open the gate and make your way through the wreckage of the ancient fort===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|Based on the surrounding structures, it's likely that you've arrived in a core area of an ancient citadel that used to stand on the edge of civilization.<br />You can gather yourself here and investigate the trash piles you think may be of value until you lose interest in the history of this place.<br />The dangers that surround the exit of the old town wreckage have been cleared out. You can leave this place at any time.}}

===Get closer to Cocolia's echo===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|The echoing mirage of the Supreme Guardian has appeared in front of you once again &mdash; however, this time, the guardian's noble daughter is no longer by her side.<br />Although this place has been devoured by the Fragmentum to its core and nothing is behaving the way it should, this is something even more peculiar...<br />Is this a sign of misfortune? Or could it just be one error out of the tens of thousands taking place in the Fragmentum? The answer to this question lies in the echoing cadence of the humanoid.}}

===Enter the innermost part of the Corridor of Fading Echoes===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|The air becomes less alive the deeper you go. An odor of gloom and rust fills your noses.<br />You feel the lingering murmured whistling become clearer in your head and become extremely dizzy.<br />Judging by what you've seen so far, you're very close to the exit of the Fragmentum maze. The question is &mdash; what lies beyond?<br />You'll only find out if you press onward.}}

===Set out to the end of this journey===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Corridor of Fading Echoes|update|Your first Trailblaze journey is nearing its end. At the top of these steps is the original of it all &mdash; it is where the Stellaron lay.<br />Remove the Stellaron and Belobog will be completely freed from the instability and fabricated peace, and the planet will welcome a new life.<br />However, an ending is but a new beginning &mdash; your Express will also return to its rails and head towards the next destination.<br />Once you are ready, mount the steps and witness the ending to this planet and journey.}}
