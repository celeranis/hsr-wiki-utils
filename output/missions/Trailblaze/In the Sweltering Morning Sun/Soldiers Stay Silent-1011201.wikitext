{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|Thanks to your time on Jarilo-VI, you have mastered the art of persuasion. The Supreme Guardian's most loyal Captain is now on your side... It's a pity that he cannot go with you and witness what awaits Belobog.<br />Gepard is guarding the gate to the Fragmentum. He and his best guards will form up and clear the way for you once you are ready.}}
