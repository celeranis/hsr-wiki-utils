{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Everwinter Hill|You wake up in a strange place surrounded by nebulous stars, seemingly enveloped by an amber-colored destiny.<br />The last thing you remember is being pierced by Cocolia's lance... Could this be the afterlife? But your mind is still very clear and your body still has strength... These resounding voices in your head seem to be guiding you, telling you that you are still alive.<br />Your companions might still be in fierce combat with Cocolia. You have to find a way to get back to their side, no matter what.}}
