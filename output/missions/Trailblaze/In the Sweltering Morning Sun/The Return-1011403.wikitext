===Find a way to escape this strange space and return to reality{{subst:void|<!--101140301-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Everwinter Hill|You wake up in a strange place surrounded by nebulous stars, seemingly enveloped by an amber-colored destiny.<br />The last thing you remember is being pierced by Cocolia's lance... Could this be the afterlife? But your mind is still very clear and your body still has strength... These resounding voices in your head seem to be guiding you, telling you that you are still alive.<br />Your companions might still be in fierce combat with Cocolia. You have to find a way to get back to their side, no matter what.}}

:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 201.ogg}} '''Seele:''' It's over...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 201.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 202.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Mother... Did you wake up from that dream...?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 201 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 201 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wow... that was a tough trailblazing expedition. Dan Heng, (Trailblazer) &mdash; we made it! But, uh, what are we gonna do with the Stellaron? It's usually Mr. Yang who handles it...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 201.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I've informed Himeko and Mr. Yang already. They'll seal the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 202.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Nice! The crisis on this world is basically over, right?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 202.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 203.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...The storm still rages on.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 204.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Now that the Stellaron is sealed, the Eternal Freeze will slowly recede. The Fragmentum won't aggressively expand anymore, but nor will it disappear. Jarilo-VI has a chance to return to life, but it will take time...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 205.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It will depend on the efforts of the people here.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 203.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Thank you... all of you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't be too hard on yourself.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 204 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 204 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Thank you (Trailblazer)... I&mdash;I'm fine. Don't worry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you want to do now?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 205.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' This victory is only the beginning for Belobog.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't think of anything funny to say...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 206.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Hehe, start thinking, we're going to need all the humor we can get... At least the biggest hurdle is behind us.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 207.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' There is still much to do... The people will have felt the effects of the Engine of Creation. There are so many questions to answer, so many truths to reveal...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 208.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I don't know whether I can get the people to accept all this...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Tell everyone the truth.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 209.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Can I really do that...?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 210.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Tell everyone about Mother's true motives... about a lie perpetrated for 700 years...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 202.ogg}} '''Seele:''' No... No, no way.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cover up the truth...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 211.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' You mean...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 212.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Use a lie to conceal a lie. But if I do that, then...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 203.ogg}} '''Seele:''' You have to, Bronya.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 213.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Seele?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 204.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I... I don't know how to explain it... but I don't think there's any other way.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 205.ogg}} '''Seele:''' In the Underworld, we tell the kids "things will be better tomorrow." Everyone knows it's a lie, but it gets them to sleep with some hope.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 206.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Can you imagine the consequences if we told the people what happened here? They'd be devastated. If we can't trust the guardians, who &mdash; or what &mdash; can we trust...?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 214.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 215.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Mother died to preserve Belobog.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 203.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...What?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 216.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The visitors from beyond the sky told her the secret of the Stellaron. She knew that Alisa Rand, the first supreme guardian, had failed to destroy it...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 217.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...and yet she decided to challenge its power &mdash; a power beyond human comprehension. Supreme Guardian Cocolia sacrificed herself to dispel the dark clouds enveloping this city.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 218.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...From here on out, that's the "truth" the world will hear. What do you think?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 207.ogg}} '''Seele:''' It keeps the hope of preservation alive, at least.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 206.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It's logical... and hard to disprove.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 204.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why do we have to lie? ...I'm abstaining &mdash; I like telling the truth. But... I get what you're trying to do.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Agreed &mdash; let's use this version.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 219 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 219 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Thank you for understanding, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A lie will always be a lie...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 220.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I understand, but... I must protect those that believe in the Architects...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Maybe we include some of the cool stuff we did?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 221.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Sorry... I'll be sure to make it up to you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 222.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' For many people, mother was an outstanding guardian... The whole truth will live on in my mind &mdash; all the mistakes, madness, evil, and dreams therein... I will be the one to carry that burden.
:{{tx}}

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 213.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere? Do you feel dizzy? Tired? Or...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 231.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...I don't know, Seele. I feel... cold... all over.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 214.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Isn't that normal? This place is freezing... *sneeze* Ugh...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 232.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Let's get out of here before you catch a cold too.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 215.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Don't worry, I'm a tough cookie. Here, hold on to me... let's go.
