:{{A|VO chapter1 9 bronya 201.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...N&mdash;No...
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 cocolia 201.ogg}} '''Cocolia:''' Do not resist, Bronya... Accept the common will!
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 bronya 202.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' No... I... I don't want this...
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 cocolia 202.ogg}} '''Cocolia:''' Look upon their promised future, Bronya! A world without poverty, without cold, without suffering... A world where people no longer have to pray like prisoners for survival... A world that we can guard for all eternity.
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 cocolia 203.ogg}} '''Cocolia:''' Seven hundred years ago, we tried and fought unceasingly, believing that the radiance of human nature could shepherd us towards rejuvenation. And to what end? A crushing defeat!
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 cocolia 204.ogg}} '''Cocolia:''' Why, when faced with irrefutable strength, is our first thought always to resist, to cover our ears, instead of hearing the call?
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 cocolia 205.ogg}} '''Cocolia:''' It is the conceit and cowardice entrenched in the depths of human nature &mdash; so difficult to efface. Cast them aside, break free of the chains that bind you! The Stellaron will lead humanity to evolve, and THEY will...

:{{A|VO chapter1 9 seele 205.ogg}} '''Seele:''' You wish! We're not going down before you do!
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 seele 206.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Bronya! I don't know what happened between you and them. Even if you explained it to me, I probably wouldn't understand all the crazy details. But there are two things I do know...
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 seele 207.ogg}} '''Seele:''' One: These guys have come through hell to get here &mdash; to seal this Stellaron thing.
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 seele 208.ogg}} '''Seele:''' And two: Do you remember what I said? If anything happened to you, I'd save you.
:{{A|VO chapter1 9 seele 209.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Do you understand? Even if the damage is done &mdash; even if you've completely forgotten our promise, then... then I'm just gonna have to knock you out and bring you back myself!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We need you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Belobog needs you, Bronya.
