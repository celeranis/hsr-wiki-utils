:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 274.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Bronya, we're back!
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 247 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 247 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' March, Dan Heng, (Trailblazer)... it's wonderful you made it to the address.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 248.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Sorry, I know the invitation was very last minute... but I needed to get the news out as soon as possible. The longer people waited, the more rumors started to swirl. The situation risked spinning out of control.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you fully recovered?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 249.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Yes, I'm fine now. Don't worry.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 250.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' My mother... she tried to force the voice of the Stellaron into my head... It was a terrible feeling. I don't know what would've happened if you hadn't shown up.
::Was Seele not there for the address?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was Seele not there for the address?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 251.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' She was there. She just made sure no one could see her.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 252.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Seele is still new to the vastness of the Overworld &mdash; she feels uncomfortable in a big crowd... I'll help her adjust to life here.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 275.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That was some speech, Bronya! If I had to talk like that in front of a huge crowd, I'd be shaking head to toe!
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 253.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' It was all just a bunch of palatable lies. I hope you never have a similar experience, March.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The part about preserving the seed of civilization was real.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's what you do as a leader that matters.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sometimes people need to hear white lies.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 254.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Mm... I'd prefer to be honest with the people... but I also want to preserve their hope.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 276.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Dan Heng, wanna... talk about Mr. Yang's findings?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 224.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Mm, allow me to explain.
:Telling Bronya about Welt's observations...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 255.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Which means the Fragmentum has already taken root by this point. Even though the Stellaron is sealed, we won't be able to reverse the damage immediately...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stellarons are terrible things.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, we promised you...
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We will find a way to root out the Fragmentum.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Astral Express will do everything within our power to help.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 259.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Besides, I agree with Mr. Yang. Ultimately, the fate of Belobog is in the hands of its own people...

:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 225.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Worth celebrating, I'd say.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} On a scale from 1 to 5, how would you rate this journey...
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 226.ogg}} '''Dan Heng and March 7th:''' Two point five. Five!
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 279.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...What!? That run-of-the-mill, huh?
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 danheng 227.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' My scoring criteria are different from yours.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 280 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 280 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh! Anyway, we should be asking (Trailblazer)... Any thoughts you want to share?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Time for a nap...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 281.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait, what? No way &mdash; we're about to leave and I've hardly got any decent photos.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 282.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Come on, let's go back to the Administrative District and hang out for a bit longer!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel like I could fight a hundred more monsters!
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 283.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's the spirit! Come on, we should take some more photos before we head back to the Express.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 284.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Let's go! One more round in the Administrative District!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What will the next adventure be like?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 285.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Equally unforgettable, I'm sure. Anyway, don't worry about the future &mdash; live in the moment!
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 mar7th 286.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Let's go for one more round in the Administrative District! I wanna take more photos!

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 217.ogg}} '''Seele:''' The inauguration ceremony went very smoothly. I didn't expect so many Underworlders to come and listen to the address.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 218.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Everyone seemed supportive, too. Seems like Bronya made a pretty good impression on them.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Maybe Natasha and Oleg helped promote her a little.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 219.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Possibly. They always think ahead.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 220.ogg}} '''Seele:''' If those two approve of Bronya, then everyone following Wildfire won't question her either.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Were you there? I don't think I saw you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 221.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Of course I was! I was just hidden in the crowd. I'm glad you didn't notice me &mdash; means I'm doing something right. I want to protect Bronya in my own way.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 222.ogg}} '''Seele:''' She wanted me to stand next to her, but I'm glad I stuck to my guns. Besides, I'm not sure I could handle that many people staring at me.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} She will be an outstanding leader.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 223.ogg}} '''Seele:''' No doubt. I figured that out back in the Underworld.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} We're about to leave Belobog.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 224.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Leave...? So soon? I thought you'd stay for a few more days &mdash; at least until everything had calmed down...
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 225.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Ahh... I get it. People are waiting for you to go back so you can keep traveling, right?
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 226.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Shame, I thought we'd have more time to discuss all the crazy things you guys like to talk about. Looks like that'll have to wait till next time.
::{{A|VO chapter1 10 seele 227.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...And before you say anything, there will be a next time. I know we'll meet again.

;(Talk to Bronya)
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 263.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' If you walk with your head down and your heart full of fear, your steps will grow heavier and your spirit will suffer.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 264.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' But if you find something to look up to and move forward with hope, then your steps will grow lighter... and if you should fall, you'll be on your feet before you know it.
:{{A|VO chapter1 10 bronya 265.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Thank you for teaching me this, Trailblazers.
