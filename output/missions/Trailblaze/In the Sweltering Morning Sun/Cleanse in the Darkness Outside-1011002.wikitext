===Talk to Serval and hide at the workshop{{subst:void|<!--101100203-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Administrative District|update|The Supreme Guardian Cocolia has her Silvermane Guards lined up on both sides of the road to welcome you and your companions back to the Overworld. Such a grand reception can only come from a worthy ruler.<br />The Guards, however, are not so keen on the idea of putting up a show. To complete their task as soon as possible, they'd rather see you hogtied and thrown into the Qlipoth Fort.<br />You and your company are now talk of the town... Maybe you should listen to Dan Heng and go to the workshop to avoid unnecessary attention.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|The Supreme Guardian Cocolia has her Silvermane Guards lined up on both sides of the road to welcome you and your companions back to the Overworld. Such a grand reception can only come from a worthy ruler.<br />The Guards, however, are not so keen on the idea of putting up a show. To complete their task as soon as possible, they'd rather see you hogtied and thrown into the Qlipoth Fort. <br />Although you've managed to hide in the workshop, Dan Heng seems to have his guard up against the noble girl with complex relations with the Supreme Guardian.<br />It'd be best to talk with Serval first and see what you can find out about her.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|Luckily, Dan Heng's suspicions seem to be unfounded: Serval quickly sides with you and even provides a great deal of valuable information.<br />You are safe for the time being but will soon be waist-deep in danger again... This time, the destination is a place with the most Silvermane Guards in all of Belobog &mdash; the Fragmentum Frontline.<br />No risk, no reward, as they say. If you want to truly dismantle the crisis in front of you, being exposed to danger seems inevitable.}}

Thanks to Serval's resourcefulness, she was able to persuade her brother to leave and prevent a disaster from happening.<br />You are safe for the time being but will soon be waist-deep in danger again...
