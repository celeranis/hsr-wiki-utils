{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|The trailblazing expedition on Jarilo-VI has finally reached a satisfying conclusion.<br />Himeko and Welt both give high praises for your first mission.<br />You can keep chatting with Himeko and see if she can answer some of the questions lingering in your mind.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}


;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 211.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Express crew tread upon the Trailblaze. We travel between worlds, like a thread weaved into the life stories of others.
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 212.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The universe is vast beyond our imagination. It's a miracle that our paths converge. The fact that we get to know and travel with each other can only be seen as the design of destiny.
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 213 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 213 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Thank you for becoming our companion, (Trailblazer). I'll do my best to answer any questions you may have.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I'd like to talk about the battle with Cocolia.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 214.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Sure. Oftentimes those who are involved in historic events don't have the opportunity to see things from a wider perspective. I hope as an onlooker I may provide some help.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Path of Preservation...
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 215.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Qlipoth the Preservation is known for THEIR... indifference. Unless you become a zealot like those with the Corporation, it's hard to share in the Aeon's power.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 216.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Determined to preserve the world they love, the Architects held on for hundreds of years. But as the Fragmentum continued to advance, their already wavering faith started to show some cracks.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 217.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' And one particular guardian, Cocolia, abandoned the Path of Preservation altogether. In contrast, you stood your ground and proved your faith in the Amber Lord.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 218.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Judging by how the battle turned out, Qlipoth responded to your wish. THEIR gaze infused you with the power to wield the weapon of a supreme guardian and to take control of the Colossus.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} I was meant to thank you for your support during the battle.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 219.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' *chuckles* Don't mention it. Welt and I may have stayed on the Express this whole time, but we've been watching over you the moment you set foot on Jarilo-VI.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 220.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Friends look after each other, the same goes for us Nameless. Please remember, no matter where you are in the universe, the Express will always be behind you.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} The source of Cocolia's power...
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 221.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...is a Stellaron, there's no doubt about that.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 222.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' What I've gathered so far suggests it's likely that the supreme guardian was corrupted by the Stellaron at a very young age. All the tragedies that came after can be traced to that point...
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 223.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' On the flip side, we can't judge Cocolia too harshly. Imagine if it were you or me who had to sit on the throne and watch the city slowly being brought to its knees... Would we not question what we believed in?
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Return}} Let's talk about something else.
:::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 224.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Sure, ask away. We've got plenty of time.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Can Jarilo-VI go back to what it was like before the Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 225.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Welt may be better equipped to answer that. But if you want my two cents...
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 226.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I'd say it's unlikely. I guess it's possible, but it would take a long time.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 227.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I can tell from your report that the new Supreme Guardian of Belobog is a smart young lady with leadership qualities. What's more important is that she now understands her people after the journey with you.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 228.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The firm and honest support she gets from people around her will also prove immensely useful. But fate likes to play tricks on people. Even if during their lifetime they managed to make Jarilo-VI prosper again to a certain degree...
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 229.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' They will remain vulnerable and helpless to countless threats lurking in the recesses of the universe. We can only give them our best wishes from afar.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What happened to the Stellaron?
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 230.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's virtually impossible to destroy a Stellaron. No one, not even Herta, has found a way to break its structure. The best we can do at this stage is to prevent its energy from overflowing.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 231.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' When the supreme guardian was defeated, the Stellaron that had been transmitting energy to her exposed its weakness to us for a brief period of time, allowing Welt and I to contain its power.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 232.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That's about all we can do about a Stellaron. It may be suppressed for now, but it's only a matter of time before it regains power.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 233.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But this brief window should allow the people on this planet to heal and rebuild.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thanks for your patience, Himeko.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 234 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 11 himeko 234 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You're most welcome, (Trailblazer). Have some rest, you've earned it.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Chat with Welt about what you've seen{{subst:void|<!--101150230-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|update|The trailblazing expedition on Jarilo-VI has finally reached a satisfying conclusion.<br />Himeko and Welt both give high praises for your first mission.<br />You can keep chatting with Welt and see if he can answer some of the questions lingering in your mind.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}


;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 204 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 204 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So, your first trailblazing expedition has concluded. How do you feel, (Trailblazer)?
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 205.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Be it joy or pain, success or regret, it's all part of the journey. Those feelings will accompany you as long as you tread on the Trailblaze, and one day you'll grow used to them.
:{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 206.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It seems you have something on your mind. Let's hear it. I'd like to hear a fresh perspective myself... Hehe, as talkative as Himeko is, we've pretty much run out of topics.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} The Fragmentum and the Eternal Freeze... will they disappear?
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 207.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm afraid not.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 208.ogg}} '''Welt:''' As I've mentioned before, the Stellaron's influence on Jarilo-VI is more profound than we might think. I don't think Belobog's fight against the lingering effects of the Stellaron will end any time soon.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 209.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But, the balance of power is tilting ever so slightly towards humanity, the crucial factor being the hope you brought about.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 210.ogg}} '''Welt:''' As intangible as it may sound, don't underestimate hope because the power it inspires has no limit. Like the Stellaron, it's a seed that may grow into something much bigger. But in my opinion, the fruit that hope bears will have a much bigger impact than that of the Stellaron.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I relayed your view of the Stellaron's effects to Bronya.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 211.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Is that so? Well, I think you did the right thing. It's better to move forward with the burden of knowledge than to tread a perilous road with blind optimism.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 212.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I remember a distant world where the people were faced with unimaginable danger every single day. But they saved their planet time after time with wisdom and courage.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 213.ogg}} '''Welt:''' This goes to show how much of a difference ordinary people can make. I hope Jarilo-VI sees that too.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} This mission would've been much easier if you were there.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 214.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hehe... I, too, wished to go with you. But Himeko insisted on letting you and your friends rise to the challenge.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 215.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'd been observing what's happening on the ground from the Express, and I have to admit that I got sweaty palms a couple of times. I was glad to see you three meet friends you could trust and overcome hardships. Well done.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 216.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Himeko was calm from the very beginning. She kept telling me to trust you youngsters' decisions.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 217.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hehe... And she was right. I really need to stop worrying so much.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's been nice chatting with you, Mr. Yang.
::{{A|VO chapter1 11 welt 218.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Likewise. Get some sleep, we'll be heading off again soon.
