:{{A|VO chapter4 2 danheng 170.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What magnificent creatures.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 phainon 139.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' These large mild-mannered creatures are called dromas. They're humanity's most loyal companions. We'll be relying on them to get us through the rugged mountain roads on the way to the holy city.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 phainon 140.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Dromas are very docile, even first-time riders can steer them easily. Here, give it a try. Remember to hold the reins tight.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 dadishou 101.ogg}} '''Dromas:''' Urrhh... uuuhhhh&mdash;
:Ride the dromas.
:You see all the white shells jutting out from the dromas' limbs and plan to use them as footholds...
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 dadishou 102.ogg}} '''Dromas:''' Urrhh!
:The dromas lets out a dissatisfied growl and easily tosses you several meters away.
:This is your idea of docile!?
:Why you! It's a good thing I managed to dodge quickly.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 phainon 141.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' I forgot to mention. Don't touch their white stone humps. When the Earth Titan blessed these creatures, it's said they also stuffed their ill tempers into these humps.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 dadishou 103.ogg}} '''Dromas:''' Urrhh... uuuhhhh&mdash;
:Carefully ride the dromas.
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 phainon 142.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' See? Easy, wasn't it?
:{{A|VO chapter4 2 nuodusi 114.ogg}} '''Noldus:''' Everyone, how did you find our lyre performance earlier? We've been in exile for many days and haven't touched our instruments in a long time. I fear our skills have grown rusty, and we've made a spectacle of ourselves.

:{{A|VO chapter4 2 phainon 143.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Suffering's bad for your health, and it won't help your faith much, either. That's why it's our inherent duty as Chrysos Heirs to free everyone from suffering.
