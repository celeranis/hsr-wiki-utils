You two and a warrior named Gnaeus sign up for the festival together, piercing deeper into the inner sections of the city. There, you learn that Gnaeus is a missing divine fragment that belongs to Nikador. With five fragments of the divine restored and the past and the present realigned, Nikador loses their immortal body. Yet, what stands before the Chrysos Heirs becomes a fully restored and glorious Strife Titan.
