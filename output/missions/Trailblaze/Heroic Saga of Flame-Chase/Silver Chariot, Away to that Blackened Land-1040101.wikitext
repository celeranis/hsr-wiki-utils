Before you set out, March 7th falls ill, and the crew can only proceed using a backup plan. You and Dan Heng depart toward Amphoreus using a train coach to scout and explore. However, the coach is attacked and downed, forcing you both to land in the vicinity of a temple. Here, you meet the Chrysos Heirs Phainon and Tribbie, and follow them to reach the only pure land of the end times: The holy city of Okhema. However, you are greeted by the Strife Titan Nikador raiding the city. You decide to help and rally to the city's defense alongside the Chrysos Heirs. Finally, after a bitter battle, you manage to defeat one of Nikador's divine shells.

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 113.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' As you can see, Amphoreus is surrounded by a mass of chaotic matter that conceals it from the outside world &mdash; nearly. Conventional interstellar travel can't detect its presence, let alone pass by or land on the planet.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 114.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Yet the Garden, caught a glimpse of this place, and along with it, discovered ever-shifting Traces.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 himeko 114.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' "Three Paths interweave and fetter Amphoreus, co-authoring the fate of the world." Ordinary Pathstriders aren't known to leave traces in the mirror, so if what you said is true...

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 117.ogg}} '''Welt:''' For a world to have nurtured such marvels yet still remain unheard of throughout the cosmos? Now, that is hard to fathom.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 himeko 116.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' We already know one of the three Paths to be the Erudition...
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 116.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' I can reveal the second. In fact, you've all seen it just now. It's the Remembrance.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 118.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I see. Then it makes sense that a messenger of the Garden would be capable of unveiling Amphoreus for us. What about the final Path?
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 117.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Unfortunately, fate is keeping the third Path a mystery. I don't know what it is, either.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 118.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' Hidden beneath the brilliance of Erudition and Remembrance, yet possessing enough power to rival the other two Paths. It could be the Equilibrium, the Enigmata, or perhaps the Permanence? I have no clue at all.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 blackswan 119.ogg}} '''Black Swan:''' This white ribbon of light encircling Amphoreus might very well be a product of the three interwoven Paths. Only when Pathstriders of the Trailblaze enter the center of the vortex will its true nature be revealed.

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' A world yet to be explored by the Trailblaze... No self-respecting Nameless would turn that opportunity down.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} An opportunity hard to come by?
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 113.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Absolutely. The Astral Express has always traveled along the silver rail laid down by Akivili. We don't normally get to venture into a world beyond the knowledge of the Trailblaze.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hah! So I'm better than an Aeon!
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 114.ogg}} '''Welt:''' This is Akivili we're talking about. In the first instance, every one of THEIR stops was a world no human had ever set foot on. The Astral Express has always traveled along the silver rail laid down by Akivili, so we don't normally get to venture into a world beyond the knowledge of the Trailblaze.
:{{A|VO chapter4 1 welt 115.ogg}} '''Welt:''' But this time, we might just get the chance to add a brand-new stop to the astral charts. I don't mind telling you &mdash; I'm a little excited.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It doesn't feel any different to me...
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 himeko 109.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Worlds that have been mapped on the astral charts also present new surprises from time to time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Same for everyone else, right?
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 himeko 110.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Maybe not for Pom-Pom. And worlds that have been mapped on the astral charts also present new surprises from time to time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are credits going to be useless there?
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 himeko 111.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That's quite the detail to fixate on. Perhaps you should be worrying about language barriers instead?

;(Talk to Dan Heng)

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I can't provide many details about our destination this time. You can ask the Memokeeper if you want to know more.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you nervous, Dan Heng?
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Why do you ask that? Are you feeling nervous yourself? It'll be fine. Just trust the Crew.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh ho, the data bank's getting a huge update.
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Mhm, I suppose there's a lot to do. I'll disembark with all of you this time.

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Can I ask you something? What's your favorite part of a journey, from start to finish?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The start of a journey, when we dive into the unknown.
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Then let's go snap some photos as soon as we arrive in Amphoreus!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The middle of the journey, when some gains are made.
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Then you're going to have to give me a nudge whenever there's something worth snapping!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The end of the journey, when we wanna commemorate the adventure.
::{{A|VO chapter4 1 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Me too! This time in Amphoreus let's make sure we get a group photo that everyone loves!

:{{A|VO chapter4 1 sunday 102.ogg}} '''Sunday:''' I see.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're taking it very calmly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No comment from you?
