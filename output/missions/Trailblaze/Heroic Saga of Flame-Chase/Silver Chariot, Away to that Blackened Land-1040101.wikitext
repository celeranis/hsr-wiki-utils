|summary       = With the Express' fuel reserves on the verge of running dry, you vote to head to Amphoreus, The Eternal Land. Before you set out, March 7th falls ill, and the crew can only proceed using a backup plan. You and Dan Heng depart toward Amphoreus using a train coach to scout and explore. However, the coach is attacked and downed, forcing you both to land in the vicinity of a temple. Here, you meet the Chrysos Heirs Phainon and Tribbie, and follow them to reach the only pure land of the end times: The holy city of Okhema. However, you are greeted by the Strife Titan Nikador raiding the city. You decide to help and rally to the city's defense alongside the Chrysos Heirs. Finally, after a bitter battle, you manage to defeat one of Nikador's divine shells.
