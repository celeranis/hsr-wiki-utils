{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Audience Terminal: Energy Sector|Inside the Herta Space Station, Herta's audience with Nous had yet to end. Using all the energy available in the station, Herta activates the Audience System's terminal to try to communicate with Nous. However, the system unexpectedly failed. Upon investigation, all three sectors within the terminal are malfunctioning, requiring Herta to personally attend to each one to resolve the issues.}}
