{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Vortex of Genesis|Aglaea's control over Okhema runs far deeper than we anticipated, and the previous incident has already reached her ears. This leader of the Chrysos Heirs revealed a cold and unyielding side, going to great lengths to reassess our intentions.

:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...What is the meaning of this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why is this happening again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've been made...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As expected.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 101.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' This is no laughing matter. It's an interrogation.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 102.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' While the both of you were roaming the city, someone was paying attention to your every move. Unfortunately... you have broken your promises.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So, you are indeed aware of our transgression... However, we only did so to save a life.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 103.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' The holy city's fate is as fragile as thread. I must exercise prudence in order to eliminate sources of potential disaster.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 104.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I will grant the both of you another chance to mend our broken trust. The golden thread shall judge on my behalf. If you're truthful, you will live, else... you will perish.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 castorice 101.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' We meet again, distinguished guests.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 105.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Castorice will be your executioner.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Lady Aglaea, it is undeniable that we broke our agreement out of carelessness. However, you never explained to us how revealing that a world beyond the sky exists would lead to dire consequences.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What I want to know is, exactly how grave a crime have we committed?
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 106.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' A reasonable request. It is indeed my oversight for failing to tell you everything in time.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 107.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' There have always been people in Amphoreus who looked beyond the skies. Indeed, there used to be a usurper nation that spared no expense in constructing "skyships," with the desire to break through the blue sky and reach the stars...
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 108.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' However, {{Rubi|Aquila's|Sky Titan}} divine punishment fell the instant the fleet of skyships took flight. An entire city-state, along with all of its subjects, was reduced to ash in that moment.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 109.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It's not that Amphoreus is unwilling to head toward the stars. Yet, anyone who even thinks about breaching the firmament would undoubtedly infuriate the gods, causing this land of the living to burn and an entire nation of mortals to perish. The {{Rubi|Eye of Twilight|Sky Titan}} is only one example of this.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 110.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' This is forbidden territory which can never be ventured into.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you're saying that it's better to pretend it doesn't exist instead?
::{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Humanity has always longed for the sky... and this is something that you can't prevent.
::We mean no harm toward Amphoreus...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We mean no harm toward Amphoreus...
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 111.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Divine punishment has never been fair. As Okhema's guardian, I must do the same.

:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 131.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So much has happened today.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 132.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What? Do I have something on my face?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Today, you talked...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...more than you did in the entire three worlds before this.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 133.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Well, since the talkative one isn't around, someone else has to take her place.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 134.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' But it's been a long day for me too, so let's get through the review quickly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Agreed!
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 135.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' By estimation, it took us about twenty system hours to figure out the current conditions on Amphoreus and build connections with the locals &mdash; a pretty good start.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 136.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' But I feel that there's more to everything than meets the eye... Even the Chrysos Heirs themselves aren't as unified as we imagined.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it too late to bail out now?
::{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 137.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Don't take Aglaea's words to heart right now. Her verbal attack on us was quite sudden. There might be a reason behind it.
::We're still looking at things through a clouded lens.
::{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 138.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Aglaea's verbal attack on us was also quite sudden. There might be a reason behind it.
::Wasn't expecting Aglaea to be that ruthless...

===Submit to Aglaea's interrogation &mdash; it's better to speak the truth{{subst:void|<!--104010412-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Vortex of Genesis|update|Aglaea's control over Okhema runs far deeper than we anticipated, and the previous incident has already reached her ears. This leader of the Chrysos Heirs revealed a cold and unyielding side, going to great lengths to reassess our intentions. After such perilous moments, we must reconsider the viability of our expedition in Amphoreus.}}

:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 139.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' All four questions have been asked and answered.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 140.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' You have earned a second chance with your honesty.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 141.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Both of you may continue to stay in Okhema, and its citizens will continue to view you as distinguished guests. However, you must promise that today's farce will not occur again.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I think it's more appropriate for us to say that last part.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 danheng 108.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You seriously still expect us to help you after what we just went through?
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 142.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Regardless of your choice, the Chrysos Heirs will continue to follow the path in the prophecy.
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 143.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' You may be a ray of hope that fell onto Amphoreus. However, until all has been proven, you cannot be allowed to pose a threat to Amphoreus.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If we stay, will you continue to monitor us?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are all Chrysos Heirs as paranoid as you?
:{{A|VO chapter4 5 aglaea 144.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' For the holy city, I am willing to bear all the traits that others despise and use every heartless yet effective trick in the book.
