|summary       = The mystery behind Nikador's undying body has long been buried by the passage of time. To uncover the truth, you head toward the Abyss, seeking to borrow Oronyx's power to uncover the facts. But Oronyx reacts to your visitation with extreme resistance, creating countless impediments to deny your coming. Strangely, after meeting you, Oronyx grows calmer, and invites you to enter a "Non-Existent Memory." In these memories, you meet the Stellaron Hunters and also receive a glimpse from Fuli, Aeon of Remembrance. As you return to your senses, you find a strange pink creature by your side called Mem.
