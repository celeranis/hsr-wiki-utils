{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Seclusion Zone|Inside the Herta Space Station, Herta's audience with Nous had yet to end. Using all the energy available in the station, Herta activates the Audience System's terminal to try to communicate with Nous. However, the system unexpectedly failed. Upon investigation, all three sectors within the terminal are malfunctioning, requiring Herta to personally attend to each one to resolve the issues.}}

:{{A|VO chapter4 10 mirrorA 120.ogg}} '''Fourth Mirror:''' Hmm... This is the Audience System? It looks just like the Simulated Universe.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 116.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Keen observation. They share the same fundamental logic, and are pretty much identical in that regard.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 mirrorA 121.ogg}} '''Fourth Mirror:''' Ahh, I see. We call this... referencing, and not appropriation, right? Heh...
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 117.ogg}} '''Herta:''' One more stupid remark from you and you can watch Fifth Mirror reference your role, because I'm going to be dropping you as my assistant.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 118.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Focus now. The Audience System is divided into three zones: Energy Supply, Computing, and Communications. Each zone operates independently, and will only be integrated via the Path of Erudition when the system is booted.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 119.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Sending a message to Droidhead involves more intricacies than you can imagine. If routine trials and maintenance on such an elaborately sophisticated system are already as bad as squaring circles, then it's no surprise for glitches like this to crop up.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 mirrorA 122.ogg}} '''Fourth Mirror:''' I see. So, Madam Herta, can you use your professional judgment to tell which zone the glitch is in?
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 120.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Of course. All three.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 mirrorA 123.ogg}} '''Fourth Mirror:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 121.ogg}} '''Herta:''' No sweat. They'll be up and running again after some simple technical tweaking.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 theherta 122.ogg}} '''Herta:''' The three zones are compartmentalized, so we're going to have to troubleshoot them one at a time. Let's start with the Energy Supply Zone. Get ready, and then we'll go over.
:{{A|VO chapter4 10 mirrorA 124.ogg}} '''Fourth Mirror:''' I'm just a mirror, Madam Herta! If you're ready, then your reflection in me will also be ready to go.
