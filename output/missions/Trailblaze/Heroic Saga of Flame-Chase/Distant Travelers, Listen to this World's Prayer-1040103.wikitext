|summary       = The leader of the Chrysos Heirs, Aglaea, offers you her goodwill but also puts forth a strange request. She asks that you not mention the world beyond the sky to the people of Okhema. Okhema is a prosperous city-state, and while you're wandering its streets, a picture of March 7th's is accidentally leaked, causing the city to come abuzz with chatter about the so-called "Rosy Celestial Maiden," with the excitement almost causing fatalities. Without another choice, you are forced to reveal your identity as a visitor beyond this world.
