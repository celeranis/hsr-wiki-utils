She asks that you not mention the world beyond the sky to the people of Okhema. Okhema is a prosperous city-state, and while you're wandering its streets, a picture of March 7th's is accidentally leaked, causing the city to come abuzz with chatter about the so-called "Rosy Celestial Maiden," with the excitement almost causing fatalities. Without another choice, you are forced to reveal your identity as a visitor beyond this world.

:The lounge chair in the room looks so comfy and enticing. You're worried that you'll completely lose the motivation to Trailblaze if you lie on it.
:Think about it. All the twists and turns and hardships you've been through... are they worth it? Lying here and welcoming an eternal, comfy slumber... Maybe that's where you belong...

:{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 112.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Something is definitely off about this world. Even on a planet as isolated as Jarilo-VI, the people still had an understanding of space, and even Paths and Aeons.
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 113.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The sky above Amphoreus, though, is more like... a prison. They clearly have advanced technology, so who could imagine that even discussing what's beyond the sky would be taboo?
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 114.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Do you remember the mass of chaotic matter concealing Amphoreus from the rest of the universe? I can't help thinking that someone is intentionally keeping Amphoreus hidden. Their Titans could also be related to some Aeon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is indeed a foggy situation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What should we do now?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't stop thinking about your broken spear...
::{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 115.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Phainon promised to fix it. We can ask him about it when we see him.
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 116.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Let's explore the city like Aglaea suggested. We helped defend their city, after all. This is a good chance to fish around for information while they still have a good impression of us.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location="Eternal Holy City" Okhema|update|After defeating a manifestation of Nikador, Aglaea, the leader of the Chrysos Heirs, guided us to Marmoreal Palace. There, she revealed the history of Amphoreus to us in a new and enlightening way.}}

:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 103.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "Amphoreus started off as a ball of chaos!"
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 104.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "The three Fate Titans wrote laws to govern the world, another three Foundation Titans created the earth, ocean, and skies, and a different three Creation Titans designed and gave life to human beings &mdash; like you and me."
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 105.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "But three baddie Titans soon snuck in, bringing a terrible horrible disaster with them!"
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 106.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "So, the Titans got angry, and no one was willing to give in. Their followers then decided to do the same, fighting and killing each other."
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 107.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "Everyone fought for a really, really long time, disturbing and hurting all people living in the world. Until one day &mdash; something big happened!"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Listen eagerly.)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yours truly descended upon your world!
::{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 108.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "It's not your turn! No interrupting me in class!"
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 jinglingB 109.ogg}} '''Bath Sprite:''' "A prophecy appeared on Amphoreus! Something no one saw coming!"

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's wrong?
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 aglaea 125.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' The way up from here leads to a bath that the Council granted exclusively to the Chrysos Heirs. The bath is strictly off limits to anyone other than the Heirs.
:{{A|VO chapter4 4 aglaea 126.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I'm willing to make an exception, considering you're guests from beyond the sky. But if I were to bring both of you in at once... I'd be blatantly disrespecting our traditions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a puzzling custom.
::{{A|VO chapter4 4 danheng 106.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It's probably more of a "hero's privilege."
::That's a strict custom.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a strict custom.
