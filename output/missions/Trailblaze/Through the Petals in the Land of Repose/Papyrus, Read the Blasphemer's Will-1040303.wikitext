:::{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 114.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' (Titans and Aeons are two distinct classes of beings. Titans can communicate with us humans, and it is not impossible for us to overpower them. Upon their demise, we can even take over their divinity.)

::{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 123.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' The Grove of Epiphany is home to seven schools of thought. While all seven schools are founded on the ideologies of Thalesus the First Scholar, each is unique in its own way. Among them, the Venerationists revere and worship the Titans the most.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:These are complaint letters from the scholars about Anaxagoras "The Blasphemer." There's a thick stack of letters.
:Based on the dust accumulated and the perfectly intact seals, the complainee did not even bother opening them and just chucked them aside into a corner.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 150.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' This is... about Anaxa? I should read this. Hyacine, you should come have a look, too.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 141.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Ack, it's so dusty in here... Whoa, are these all complaints about him?
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 142.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' I can already see what they must have written: "Anaxa has no respect for the gods! His very existence undermines order in our society!" ...They're probably all things like that.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 151.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Does Anaxa hold that much influence?
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 143.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Why else would they call him "the Great Performer"? When Anaxa established his school of thought, the first thing he apparently did was read his own work to everyone.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 144.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' "Are the Titans truly an accurate reflection of what humans think gods should be? Worlds created by gods are indubitably perfect, but what of Amphoreus? Only foolishness and insensitivity everywhere you turn!"
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 152.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...An uncanny impersonation. What happened after?
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 145.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' They marched him straight to the seat of judgment before he could finish.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 146.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Though what he took on in the end was more a debate than an actual trial. He had to address every one of the scholars' allegations, or face expulsion from the Grove.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 147.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' The first allegation was... ahem. "Do you agree that since the Titans created the heavens and earth, so the mountains, rivers, and seas must likewise be their creations?"
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 153.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...Am I supposed to put myself in Anaxa's shoes and answer that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes.
::{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 154.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' As told in the myths, the seas, the skies, and the earth are all, beyond the shadow of a doubt, creations of the Titans.
::{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 148.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Anaxa would've probably been spared a lot of trouble if he had answered this way... Instead, he quoted past instances of the Flame-Chase Journey and posited that humans have the potential to take over the divinity of Titans.
::No.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 155.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Based on the history of the Flame-Chase Journey, humans have the potential to take over the divinity of Titans.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 149.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Anaxa said the same thing then.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 hyacine 150.ogg}} '''Hyacine:''' Needless to say, his critics didn't take kindly to his answer, so they followed up with a second allegation.
:{{tx}}

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:A book covered in annotations from many scholars. Its title is ''The Art of Sophistry: 40 Ways to Improve Your Debating Skills''.
:You skim through it, and the highlighted methods include virtual causation, false premises, contradiction conversion, conflating prevarication and reality, misinterpreted punctuation, misattribution, and generalizing specificity, among others.
:Amidst it are scholars' exclamations: "A true eye-opener, the art of language knows no bounds," "If I can't master sophistry, I can at least learn to defend myself against them as an honest man," and so on.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 147.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The last resort is... "When all else fails, employ brute force."
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 148.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...This isn't going to be of any help, that's for sure.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:A record of the many research topics a Caprist scholar had applied for, and the replies from their school's Sage about these topics...
:Topic 1: A discovery that many mythical beasts renowned for their longevity actually reside in areas with poorly managed birth and death records for such creatures. Permission to research. Reply: Lacks research significance, not approved.
:Topic 2: An observation of real plants within the Grove imitating the growth patterns of nearby White Dryads. Permission to research. Reply: Falls under the domain of the Lotophagist school, not approved.
:Topic 3: Investigating the feasibility of placing flying birds into rocket tubes to guide the direction of the rocket's flight. Permission to research. Reply: Too fanciful, not approved.
:...The subsequent topics grew increasingly eclectic, yet the outcome of the replies remained unchanged.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 149.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Impressive tenacity... Hopefully it helped him survive the black tide.
:{{A|VO chapter4 23 danheng 159.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' These trees... They're like a maze.
