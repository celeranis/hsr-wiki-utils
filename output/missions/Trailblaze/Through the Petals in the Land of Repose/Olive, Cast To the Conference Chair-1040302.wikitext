:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 127.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Continuing from the earlier topic, let us discuss our common enemy: Aglaea.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 128.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' She is the second-most experienced Chrysos Heir across the whole of Okhema, who has gradually lost her humanity to the ravages of time and the ablation of the Coreflame... A formidable opponent indeed.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 129.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Admittedly, there is ample reason for her to take your life. Yet, your previous reasoning is quite sound. As a seasoned political animal, it's unclear whether she will actually cross that irreversible boundary. Moreover, she still needs you alive so that the Titan's trial can be completed...
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 130.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Is there anyone present who can swear by the sacred vow of {{Rubi|Kephale|Worldbearing Titan}} and guarantee that you weren't in league with that woman before coming here? Are you just trying to pull the wool over our eyes and aid her in her savagery?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She is prepared to execute me.
::{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 206.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' I believe you're aware of Castorice the executioner. Long before I returned to Okhema, Aglaea had already dispatched her to monitor me. If I weren't able to reach this place in time, I would have been forced to meet {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} first.
::{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 207.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' As compared to a comprehensive plan with uncertain results, if you decide to cut open my chest and remove the Coreflame, wouldn't that settle her nerves even more? Everything is in place &mdash; she just needs the right timing.
::She just needs vassals who will do her bidding without question.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She just needs vassals who will do her bidding without question.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 210.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' If Aglaea required a suitably intelligent Chrysos Heir, then I'm the best fit for her needs. However, it's quite evident that she has no need for a Chrysos Heir who could break free of her control at any time.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 211.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Since I believe in neither Titans nor the prophecy, there's no way that I would willingly walk on the path that she extols. Given how rigorously she enforces her principles, how would she ever accept a heretic such as me?
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 132.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Hah... I understand what you mean.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 133.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' At the very least, the both of us agree that this tyrant who wallows in extravagance and greed is the greatest threat to achieving peace in Okhema. The Council of Elders is willing to defend your right to live, just as we defend every oppressed citizen.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 134.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' However, I regret to say that sentiments in favor of the Chrysos Heirs and Aglaea are only growing in magnitude. The peace that we are aspiring toward, as well as everything that we hold dear, will be destroyed completely. The city will be burned to ashes and the citizens' blood will be shed...
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 135.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Tell me, what are you willing to do for our esteemed citizens so that they can vanquish the enemies of our fine city?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Garnering my support is equivalent to garnering the support of the entire Grove.
::{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 214.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Although the circumstances are rather unfortunate, from an objective point of view, it is an undeniable fact that ever since the Grove was attacked, I have become the de facto leader of the Grove.
::{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 215.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' The Council of Elders needs more backing if it wishes to topple Aglaea and it's evident that the academy wields considerable influence.
::{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 216.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' At the very least, I have served as the Grove's special envoy to Okhema for a significant amount of time. Of course, this also means that I will hold a crucial vote at the citizens' assembly.
::I will be the one to shatter Aglaea's self-righteousness.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I will be the one to shatter Aglaea's self-righteousness.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 217.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Aglaea's authoritarianism, conceit, and arrogance have granted her unfettered control for the most part. Yet, these traits are also her greatest weakness. If I can render her helpless by forcing her to experience the agonizing pain of betrayal, I am certain she will never recover from such a setback.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 137.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' Heh, surely you don't believe that such a tiny betrayal will be enough to push her to her wits' end?
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 218.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' What's more, there are many who remain silent, merely watching to see how much chaos I can unleash... Not to mention, you know full well that the Chrysos Heirs have never been a united front.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 138.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' In the name of {{Rubi|Kephale|Worldbearing Titan}}, Okhema thanks you for your sincere and valuable thoughts.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 139.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' At this stage, it's clear that you and I understand the benefits to be won from this discussion. Let me put it plainly: The Council of Elders has always been renowned for its fairness, and that fairness is built on a foundation of sincerity...
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 kainisi 140.ogg}} '''Caenis:''' The Council of Elders has vowed to all citizens of Okhema that it will always remain loyal to them. As for you, my lord, how will you guarantee that you will be able to live up to such earnestness and will not betray Okhema's indomitable citizens when the opportunity presents itself, just as you now betray Aglaea when it suits you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How absurd. My loyalty is unquestionable.
:{{A|VO chapter4 22 anaxa 222.ogg}} '''Anaxa:''' Hmph, surely you jest. My loyalty does not need to be proven. The fact that the Council of Elders is asking for proof of my loyalty is itself akin to a form of betrayal.
