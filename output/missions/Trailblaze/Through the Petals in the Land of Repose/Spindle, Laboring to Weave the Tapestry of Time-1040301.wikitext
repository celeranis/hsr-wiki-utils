:{{DIcon|Arrow}} WE are ready, Mem and me.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 120.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Mmm, it seems that this sacred beast is just as indispensable, given their intricate ties to the Titan.
::I'm still on the fence...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm still on the fence...
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 121.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' I understand. It was the sacred beast's idea, after all. However, it warrants careful consideration, given their intricate ties to the Titan.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 101.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Hehe, thanks to you, I've evolved from a little dog into a sacred beast!
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 122.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' Surrendering the Coreflame is a Chrysos Heir's duty. Your selfless assistance is deeply appreciated.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 123.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' However, I urge you to carefully consider the risks of accepting the trial: Becoming a demigod means forsaking your humanity. You will inherit Oronyx's divinity and bear the Time of Amphoreus, all on your own.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 124.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' From that point onward, your fate will be forever intertwined with ours, never to be separated again &mdash; until the end of Genesis.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you trying to talk me out of it?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 125.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' On the contrary, you are the only one who qualifies to attain divinity. Yet, for that very reason, I do not wish to pressure you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there a plan B?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 126.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It's exceedingly rare to find a capable Chrysos Heir. If this path proves unattainable, I am willing to lower my expectations.
::Is there a plan B?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there a plan B?
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 127.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It's exceedingly rare to find a capable Chrysos Heir. If this path proves unattainable, I am willing to lower my expectations.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 128.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' There are still many priests of Janusopolis and their descendants in the city. If I'm left with no other option, I'll try to find someone worthy among them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems like a shot in the dark.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 102.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Exactly! We can't have the civilians bear the risks, can we?
::If I do not descend into hell, who will?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 103.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Don't worry! With me by your side, even if things go south, you'll be heading straight to heaven!

:{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 106.ogg}} '''Mem:''' As for the trial, you have nothing to fear... The Time Titan may be willful at times, but they never caused us any harm.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 107.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Myth has it that {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} opposes mortals, but to me, they just seem a bit timid... like a child.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 129.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' It looks like you know that Titan rather well.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 108 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 108 f.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Oddly enough, I don't remember ever meeting them, but the moment I saw (Trailblazer), {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}'s memories were already in my head.
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 aglaea 130.ogg}} '''Aglaea:''' ...Memories that exist outside of your own experiences?
:{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 114.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' I can't explain why, but I can vouch for Mem's words. When I was in the Abyss, I heard the Titan's groans &mdash; full of pain and grievances, yet without any ill will.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I trust you all to make the right call.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do I even have any say in this?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 109.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Please, trust me on this. At the very least... can you speak with them in person?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 110.ogg}} '''Mem:''' I get the feeling that if we don't meet {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}, we'll be missing out on something huge!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I trust you to make the right call.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like there's no other way.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You need Aglaea for something too?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 116.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' I... It's nothing. I only came to discuss some matters with Lady Aglaea.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 117.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Previously, I lent her an anthology of poems that Lady Trianne had gifted to me. Tracing back, this anthology was something left for Lady Trianne by a bard before their passing.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 118.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Although personal properties should be cleared out once their owner has passed on, Lady Trianne gave this book to me since she knew how much I like to read.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you tell me more about the book?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this book... very special?
:::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 119.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' No, it's just an ordinary book. It's definitely not some kind of unique copy.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 120.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' It just contains an allegory: In a faraway land, in a city known as Styxia, a dragon corrupted by the black tide descended one day, swooping upon the city like Death itself.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 121.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' It swallowed the princess of the city whole before it was suppressed. After taking down the evil dragon, the warriors discovered that the princess' life had already met its end.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 122.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Overwhelmed by grief, the queen hired an alchemist to resurrect the princess using the dragon's flesh and blood. However, having lost memories of her previous life, the resurrected princess turned into an evil dragon herself and wreaked havoc on the city... As a result, the prosperous Styxia met its demise.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a dark story...
:::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 111.ogg}} '''Mem:''' It mustn't have been easy for Cas to narrate this story so calmly...
:::What a touching story...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a touching story...
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 112.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Huh? How... How was it touching...?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 123.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Hm, I actually think so, too.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 mem 113.ogg}} '''Mem:''' What!? That was the correct option to increase friendship level?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 124.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' The author of this book is Archepia, a wandering bard who traveled to many cities.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 125.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Among the things she left behind are poems, dictionaries, and many tragicomedy scripts. She even clearly underlined and took notes in books that covered myths with her elegant handwriting.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 126.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' While flipping through these books, I felt like I was afforded a glimpse into the life of Archepia... It felt just like I was traveling with someone that I'd never met before.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 127.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' It was as if she had yet to pass on and was still alive.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one goes through life without leaving their mark behind.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She probably did not think much of it while she was writing.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 castorice 128.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' That's right... Writing, drawing, and taking photographs... It seems like human nature to try and leave records of things.

::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 107.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Every five to ten years, the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Council of Elders}} organizes a citizens' assembly at Dawncloud.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 108.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' During the assembly, the representatives will vote on major issues such as whether the Chrysos Heirs led by Aglaea should still hold the right to govern the holy city and... whether the Titan's conquest should continue.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 danheng 104.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It sounds like some sort of system to balance the heroes and the mortals.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 109.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' That is correct. However, the problem lies in the fact that there are ill-intentioned extremists in the Council of Elders. They view the citizens' assembly as a way to restrain the Chrysos Heirs and hope to take complete control over the Flame-Chase Journey.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 110.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' We can refer to them as the opposition. During the assemblies held in the past hundred years, the voices supporting the opposition have been growing stronger in the shadows. It's only thanks to Aglaea that the Flame-Chase Journey has been able to continue to this day.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 111.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' The citizens' assembly is just around the corner, but this time, there seems to be a new variable to the situation...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it us?
:::{{A|VO chapter4 21 danheng 105.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' No. Although we might be mentioned, the Council of Elders has another target in mind.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it Anaxa?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It looks like you've realized it as well.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 112.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' I'm afraid that the Council of Elders might want to take advantage of Professor Anaxa.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 113.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Aglaea will surely take back {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}}' Coreflame. But with Anaxa's current condition... It's so unique that nobody knows how taking the Coreflame away from him will affect him.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 114.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' He has always been someone that is only concerned about his own research. I'm certain that he must want to escape from the monitoring of the golden thread and protect himself. If the opposition were to offer an olive branch at this time...
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 danheng 108.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You suspect that he might betray the Flame-Chase Journey and defect toward the Council of Elders?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 115.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' Anaxa has never believed in the prophecy, so technically it cannot be considered a betrayal. However, he has taught many Chrysos Heirs and has long been considered an important ally of Okhema. I truly do not wish to... see comrades turning on one another.
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 danheng 109.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I have a better understanding of the full picture now. Is there anything that we can do?
::{{A|VO chapter4 21 phainon 116.ogg}} '''Phainon:''' As I believe in his character, I plan to plead with Aglaea and try to buy more time for him. Then, the greatest way in which you can help is for you to know what I am fighting for.
