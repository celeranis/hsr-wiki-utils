As your journey deepened, Castorice learned from ghosts the tale of a stranded Netherwing and a girl that would bring death. It became clear that {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} had perished in the River of Souls in a bid to revive his sister, while Castorice herself was the girl of death. With help, you and Castorice forged an alchemy matrix atop the tower, birthing the Netherwing. As your own future dwindled, Castorice rode the dragon back to the nether realm, completing the Death trial and claiming demigodhood.

:Mem, did you pay your fare?
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 mem 103.ogg}} '''Mem:''' Um... I don't think I even meet the height requirement for the ticket, so I won't need one, right?
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 104.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' This is Styxia, the city of dragons and waves... Anaxa hypothesizes that the missing {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} is somewhere in these ruins.
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 105.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' This is the land of their birth... Or perhaps of their death.
:Are there any other clues?
:How would we find them?
:Aha, I know this one! They returned whence they came!
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 106.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Anaxa had used a secret alchemical art to temporarily fuse his soul with {{Rubi|Cerces|Reason Titan}} and {{Rubi|Kephale|Worldbearing Titan}}. And when he was on the verge of death, he was pulled by {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} and caught a glimpse of the flowing River of Souls.
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 107.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' This alchemy, considered a sacrilegious act, might actually make the souls of mortals and Titans attract each other...
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 108.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Even though {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} has been missing for a thousand years and even their followers haven't been able to find them... perhaps that special attraction could summon them here.

:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 109.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' I guess that's the only way. The only leads we have now are the name of this city and the fairy tale about the dragon...
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 mem 105.ogg}} '''Mem:''' {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} is even more mysterious than I am...
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 110.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Indeed. Even one as erudite as Anaxa could only point us to this place, and no further. We will be entering the unknown as soon as we take our first steps... But that won't be the first time in my long journeys.
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 111.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' I believe that...
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 castorice 112.ogg}} '''Castorice:''' Rather than standing still, taking action is by far the better option. Perhaps fate might take pity on us today and show some compassion.

:{{A|VO chapter4 27 baifuzhang 109.ogg}} '''Centurion:''' Though he returned to Styxia... he only had enough left in him to last no more than half a day. However, it was his intel that convinced us to rally together.
:{{A|VO chapter4 27 baifuzhang 110.ogg}} '''Centurion:''' He said that he witnessed the demonic specter of an evil dragon at that treacherous land. The apparition opened its giant maw and devoured everything in sight, and thus brought Styxia that thing called "Death."
