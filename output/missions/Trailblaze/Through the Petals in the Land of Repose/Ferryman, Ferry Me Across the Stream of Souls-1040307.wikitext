|summary       = In Styxia, you and Castorice witnessed the tormented souls trapped between life and death, victims of Amphoreus' broken cycle. As your journey deepened, Castorice learned from ghosts the tale of a stranded Netherwing and a girl that would bring death. It became clear that {{Rubi|Thanatos|Death Titan}} had perished in the River of Souls in a bid to revive his sister, while Castorice herself was the girl of death. With help, you and Castorice forged an alchemy matrix atop the tower, birthing the Netherwing. As your own future dwindled, Castorice rode the dragon back to the nether realm, completing the Death trial and claiming demigodhood.
