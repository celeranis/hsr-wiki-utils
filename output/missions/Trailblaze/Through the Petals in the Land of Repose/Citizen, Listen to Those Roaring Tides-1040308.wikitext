Anaxa's soul, witnessing the twin within Kephale's mind, realized that finishing the journey would make him a Titan of Era Nova. With that, he cast his final shard, securing the assembly's vote to proceed with the journey. After betraying the Council, Anaxa revealed his sin of blasphemy and told the citizens that the Council had committed the same crime as he did.
