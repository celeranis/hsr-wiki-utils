Aglaea spared no expense to summon Cipher, the demigod of Trickery, back to the city, hoping she could lend a hand. One midnight, you heard Castorice knocking on your door, and together you wandered through Okhema City, discussing her past in Aidonia. However, a well-planned gift she prepared was stolen by a thief. After a chaotic pursuit, you arranged to meet Cipher outside the city and set off for Styxia.
