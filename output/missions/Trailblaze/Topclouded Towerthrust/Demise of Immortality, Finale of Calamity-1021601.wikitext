{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Roots of the Arbor|In front of everyone, Dan Heng revealed an appearance that he was unwilling to show to others &mdash; that of the Vidyadhara high elder. Using that power to part the waters of the ancient sea, he revealed the road leading to Roots of the Arbor.<br />While you were moving forward, the Lord Ravager Phantylia had swooped ahead, going deep inside the area and plotting a conspiracy against the long-life species of the Luofu.}}
