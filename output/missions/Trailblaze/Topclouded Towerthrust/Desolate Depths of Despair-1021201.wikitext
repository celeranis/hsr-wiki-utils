:{{A|VO chapter2 6 tingyun 101.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' The master diviner must have launched the campaign while we were delayed in the Artisanship Commission.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She must have divined it was the right time.
::{{A|VO chapter2 6 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Time is of the essence. The most important task for the Xianzhou Luofu is suppressing the Stellaron.
::{{A|VO chapter2 6 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' General Jing Yuan tasked the master diviner with commanding the Cloud Knights &mdash; he would've known she'd act on the results of her divination.

:{{A|VO chapter2 6 tingyun 103.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' Centuries ago, an Emanator of Abundance besieged the Luofu with the aim of taking the Ambrosial Arbor. They destroyed half our delves and killed most of the Cloud Knights.
:{{A|VO chapter2 6 tingyun 104.ogg}} '''Tingyun:''' For long-life species, such events are more like yesterday's memories than ancient history. This awful spectacle is child's play in comparison.
