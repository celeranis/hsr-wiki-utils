===Go to Dragonvista Rain Hall===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|When you stepped into Scalegorge Waterscape, you never thought that you would encounter such a chaotic situation. The old nemesis who sought vengeance blocked your way, and the young swordsman pursuing him was determined to not let either of you leave. It wasn't until General Jing Yuan appeared that you realized your past on the Xianzhou was finally catching up to you.<br />Someone had led you, the reincarnation of the Vidyadhara high elder, to this place. Someone is asking you to reproduce the miracles of the past &mdash; except no one ever asked you whether you consent to all this.}}

===Open the "road" to the Ambrosial Arbor with the power of the high elder===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As the reincarnation of Vidyadhara high elder, you were responsible for guarding the Ambrosial Arbor in your previous life, and you were a hero that everyone looked up to. But an impulsive crime changed everyone's destiny.<br />You were determined not to repeat the same mistakes, to never again return to your homeland, and to never again take on the shape of that high elder... Unfortunately, that was all just wishful thinking.}}
