{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Alchemy Commission|On the other side of Luofu, Sushang parks the skiff at the Alchemy Commission's Healer's Market after making contact with the Cloud Knights. The three finally land after a tumultuous journey. This was once a part of your familiar home. Memories of the past swell up into your mind, and countless bygone shadows swivel before your eyes. However, your friends are currently missing. You have no plans to remain here.}}
