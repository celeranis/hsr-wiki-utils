{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|Just like in all those classic movie scenes &mdash; the elevator doesn't work.<br />Despite March 7th calling him a "walking encyclopedia," even Dan Heng, who somehow made it in time, doesn't know what to do.<br />However, Arlan, the head of the Security Department rescued by Dan Heng, probably knows the answer...<br />As expected, Dan Heng saves the day once more.}}

:{{A|VO chapter0 2 arlan 109.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Hold on. I only activated the elevator on the highest floor. We'll have to go there to use it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why? It's so far away.
::{{A|VO chapter0 2 arlan 110.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Because I mustn't give the Legion any chance to reach the master control zone by the elevator. I must ensure the safety of the station's staff.
::{{A|VO chapter0 2 arlan 111.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' So I'll have to trouble you to take a bit of a detour... Apologies.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay.
::{{A|VO chapter0 2 arlan 112.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Sorry... This space station was entrusted to Lady Asta by Madam Herta. I must do this for the safety of the master control zone and the staff there.

:{{A|VO chapter0 2 arlan 114.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' My leg is injured... I'd only slow you down. I'll stay here and shut down the elevator once you've made it to the master control zone.
:{{A|VO chapter0 2 danheng 117.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' You won't slow us down. And you should be able to shut down the elevators from the master control zone, right?
:{{A|VO chapter0 2 mar7th 141 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 2 mar7th 141 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Agreed. (Trailblazer) and I made it here safely, and now we've also got Dan Heng. We're more than enough to protect you~
:{{A|VO chapter0 2 mar7th 142.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Let us worry about the Antimatter Legion. You just follow us and keep yourself alive~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Trust us.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't overthink this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can use me as a crutch.
