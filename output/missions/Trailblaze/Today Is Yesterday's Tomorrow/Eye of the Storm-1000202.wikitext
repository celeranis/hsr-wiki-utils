===Go to the monitoring room and meet up with Arlan{{subst:void|<!--100020110-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|Just like in all those classic movie scenes &mdash; the elevator doesn't work.<br />Despite March 7th calling him a "walking encyclopedia," even Dan Heng, who somehow made it in time, doesn't know what to do.<br />However, Arlan, the head of the Security Department rescued by Dan Heng, probably knows the answer...<br />As expected, Dan Heng saves the day once more.}}

===Use the encryption key{{subst:void|<!--100020112-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|You can sense from Arlan's cautious gaze that the encryption key is not only used for unlocking authorization but also proof of your identity.<br />Hurry up and use it.}}

===Go to the upper level and take the elevator to the master control zone{{subst:void|<!--100020108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|Arlan seems to worry that he would be a hindrance, but you as a group already developed a sort of delicate rapport in how to persuade him. Could this be what it means to be companions?<br />Hurry and reach the top floor with your companions.}}
