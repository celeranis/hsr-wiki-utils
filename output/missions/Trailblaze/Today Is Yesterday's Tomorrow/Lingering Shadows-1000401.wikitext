{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Master Control Zone|You open your eyes and find yourself still in the space station, staring at a ceiling that doesn't look so strange.<br />You are living through what just happened. It seems your mind is not playing tricks on you. You wish Himeko was here.<br />You have so many questions to ask.}}

This Herta wants you to head to her office.<br />Looks like Herta developed a Simulated Universe together with a few other members of the Genius Society to explore the truth of the universe.<br />Let's give it a try.}}
