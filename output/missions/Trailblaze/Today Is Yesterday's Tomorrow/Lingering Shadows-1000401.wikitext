:{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 102.ogg}} '''Herta:''' At least give me a proper introduction! Genius Society number 83... Of all my outstanding achievements, that's what you want to mention?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Space station... Herta...?
::Space station... Herta...?
::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 103.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Yeah, up to speed yet? That place you all turned upside down? That's my property.
::You're... a robot?
::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 104.ogg}} '''Herta:''' What you're seeing here is one of my puppets. I'm using her to talk to you.

;(Talk to Herta)
:{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 132.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Still haven't made up your mind? Fine. Since I'm interested in you, I'll answer any questions you have.
::{{DIcon|?}} There are strange bubbles at the space station...
:::'''Herta:''' Oh, this is a top secret. Outsiders can never know that I own this thing. You must sign a non-disclosure agreement first.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's inside?
::::'''Herta:''' I won't tell you a thing before you sign the agreement.
::::You take the paper and pen from Herta and leave your signature. The paper is made from a bizarre material, and the ink dries up the moment it touches the paper. When you move the tip of the pen away, your heart suddenly flutters.
::::'''Herta:''' Please bear in mind that this agreement is more than a legally binding contract. You must also abide by the law of the Imaginary, which is above the social and natural laws. Not even the IPC can override it.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why didn't you say that before I signed the agreement?
:::::'''Herta:''' Would you have refused to sign if I'd told you that? You seem like the kind who doesn't think much about consequences. You will make a decision regardless of its price.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Law of the Imaginary?
:::::'''Herta:''' It is the law of the universe and the world &mdash; the only unbreakable law.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I sign another agreement to nullify this non-disclosure agreement?
:::::'''Herta:''' Don't worry. If I want to swindle you, you'll never see it coming.
::::'''Herta:''' Now that you have signed the agreement, you can do anything you like with my Memory Bubbles. Just make sure you are out of the sight of entities from the Garden of Recollection. In fact, I don't think there will be any trouble even if they catch you...
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Memory Bubble?
:::::'''Herta:''' The Garden of Recollection has ways to steal the memories of others. To preserve memories, they created a Sentiention membrane to keep the memories wrapped up in it like a bubble, making it easy to carry memories around.
:::::'''Herta:''' They have an even more advanced technology called Light Cones. With that, they can capture more than just memories... It's a shame that I can never master the Light Cone technology without the Blessing of the Aeon Fuli.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} The Garden of Recollection?
:::::'''Herta:''' It is a faction that worships the Aeon Fuli. In their opinion, the world is defined by everyone's perception, and memories are the proof of the world's existence. They are willing to forgo their physical bodies for that purpose.
:::::'''Herta:''' If you ask me, the Garden of Recollection, the Architects, The Family, and the Antimatter Legion are all idiots. They obsessively worship their Aeons.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Who are the Memokeepers?
:::::'''Herta:''' They are members of the Garden of Recollection who travel between worlds to collect precious memories. You will run into them sooner or later. I bet the memory of a Astral Express passenger is highly sought after by them.
:::::'''Herta:''' You could get lucky if you meet civilized Memokeepers, since they might use an amazing memory to exchange with yours. However, watch out for the Memosnatchers, the radicals in the Garden of Recollection. They won't give you a heads-up before stealing your memory.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I touch the bubble now?
:::::'''Herta:''' Sure~ Just touch it with your forehead. Remember to close your eyes, or your head will start spinning.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine. I'll sign it.
::::'''Herta:''' Great...

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What exactly is a Stellaron?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 142.ogg}} '''Herta:''' According to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain Path or Aeon's power.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 143.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Wherever it's located, it responds to that world's desires to advance its civilization. But, this comes at the cost of some form of disaster. The mechanism behind it is likely related to Nanook the Destruction.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you know about the Stellaron Hunters?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 144.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Oh, that weird bunch. I'm satisfied with just one Stellaron, but they've scoured the universe, obtained several, and still aren't satisfied. I don't know what their true intentions are.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 145.ogg}} '''Herta:''' {{Rubi|Screwllum|Genius Society #76}} went up against the Stellaron Hunters before. I heard there was a member whose hacking skills were on par with Screwllum.

::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 149.ogg}} '''Herta:''' You mean how it looks? Like a train. Well...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 150.ogg}} '''Herta:''' I was very interested in the Express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where I left them. Now I can't remember anything about it.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} You're the master of the space station?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 134.ogg}} '''Herta:''' On paper, yes. But I don't really care about this place. I built it, put some stuff in, left some people here, and let them just manage themselves.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 135.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. I reject the concept of ownership because I don't want the responsibilities that come with it.

:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 118.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Of course, if you want to get to the nitty-gritty, it's not that simple... This project has encountered plenty of hiccups along the way. It wasn't all smooth sailing.

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} You said there are other partners?
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 119.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Well, the project was jointly launched by four members of our society. There's Ruan Mei, a master in the field of creation. She cultivated the protoplasm simulating the Aeons. There's Screwllum, the famous mechanical aristocrat, who is responsible for writing the underlying logic of the program and the algorithm for the galaxy.
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 120.ogg}} '''Herta:''' There's me, Herta, who is responsible for providing the venue, personnel, resources, and adding some interesting systems to the project. There's also Stephen&mdash; oh, um, he wants to keep it a secret, so... forget about him.

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do you need me?
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 121.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Well, because you're special... You have a Stellaron in your body. You're living the life of a trailblazer, and even Nanook took a glance at you. So the Aeons may be more willing to accept you.
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 122.ogg}} '''Herta:''' You know, the Aeons have no concept of free will at all. THEY think about nothing but the destined Path. So, when we asked THEM questions, THEY simply ignored us, even when Screwllum gave THEM each a simulated personality and maxed out THEIR social tendency stat.
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 123.ogg}} '''Herta:''' So we decided a different approach... with you.

:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 129.ogg}} '''Herta:''' You can keep all the information you get from the simulated Aeons. Isn't that enough? Some people would sell their firstborn just to see an Aeon! And you will get to speak with THEM face to face!

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} What exactly does it simulate?
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 125.ogg}} '''Herta:''' It is a simulation of the entire universe according to Screwllum's design. But right now, only limited locations are open for access in this terminal. It's enough for us. Screwllum likes to design big useless things. He has a whole planet to himself, so he doesn't care about spatial limitations...

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why is combat a part of the design?
:::::{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 126.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Because combat is the best way to connect with one's Path. Only then can we summon those simulated Aeons. Those guys don't have any special talents, but they are as much a real pain in the butt as the actual gods...
