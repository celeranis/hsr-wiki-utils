{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|You board the Astral Express and become acquainted with a group of companions who may not always get along, but are all at least friendly.<br />A journey with an unknown destination between the stars is about to begin. Maybe you really did accidentally stumble upon some set of a Sci-Fi movie.<br />Conductor Pom-Pom announces that the warp jump is about to begin &mdash; seeing that you're still new to interstellar travel, best you find a seat and hang on tight.}}

::...Did I get dragged into a science fiction movie or something?
::This "Stellaron" thing... in my body...
::Are you trying to catch the stars?
::Hee-hee, I've done stuff like that before.
::But, it wasn't stars for me though... it was lights.

:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' When I first woke up after being rescued from the ice, I could see clusters of stars in front of me. I reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The whole crew was watching me &mdash; it was pretty embarrassing...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rescued from the ice?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, I forgot to tell you.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The whole crew was watching you?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh-huh! Like I was some kind of weird alien! I don't really blame them for being curious though &mdash; they had no idea where I came from.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You might not believe it, but before all this, I was stuck in a huge block of ice drifting through space.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Himeko and Mr. Yang and... who was it again? Anyway, they figured out a way to melt the ice and saved me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did you get frozen?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Who knows? I don't remember anything before that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you remember what happened before you were frozen?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I don't remember a thing.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Who I am, where I'm from, my name... it's like everything was erased from my mind. "March 7th" was the day they found me, so it stuck.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ever since then, I've been hanging out on this train and following it to whatever destination it decides to stop at. I'm hoping that one day, I can find my past...
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh, what am I talking about this for? Way to get everyone down, huh.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 113.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's fine. I was the one who brought it up.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 114 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 114 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Cheer up, (Trailblazer)! It's not every day someone gets to ride on the Astral Express...
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 118.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Conductor, can I get a juice, please? Thank youuuu~
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 pompom 104.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Ugh... We're jumping in five minutes! You can have something to drink when it's over!
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 119.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...But I'm thirsty now!

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Jumps are like this: They may feel novel the first few times, but you'll slowly get used to them after a few more.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' As for the mechanism... Well, if you're interested, I'll explain it to you in detail when we have more time.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' For now, just sit and wait. Remember to close your eyes &mdash; it helps with the dizziness.

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 120.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, don't worry about me. I just wanna see if I can stay on my feet this time~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good luck, I'm rooting for you.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Thanks. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. It's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't hurt yourself.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's fine, I'm sturdier than I look~ Besides, the ice will protect me.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' When I'm in danger, I instinctively create ice to protect myself.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you make things hard for yourself?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't be silly &mdash; this is fun!
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I like keeping busy, otherwise I start obsessing over... pointless things.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, don't mind me. Find a place to sit down and buckle up.

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Our next stop is a small planet called Jarilo-VI.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's been thousands of years since the last time the Express paid a visit. The data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
