{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|You board the Astral Express and become acquainted with a group of companions who may not always get along, but are all at least friendly.<br />A journey with an unknown destination between the stars is about to begin. Maybe you really did accidentally stumble upon some set of a Sci-Fi movie.<br />Conductor Pom-Pom announces that the warp jump is about to begin &mdash; seeing that you're still new to interstellar travel, best you find a seat and hang on tight.}}
