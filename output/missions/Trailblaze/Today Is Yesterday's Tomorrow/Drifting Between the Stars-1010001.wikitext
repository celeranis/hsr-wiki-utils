{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Parlor Car|You board the Astral Express and become acquainted with a group of companions who may not always get along, but are all at least friendly.<br />A journey with an unknown destination between the stars is about to begin. Maybe you really did accidentally stumble upon some set of a Sci-Fi movie.<br />Conductor Pom-Pom announces that the warp jump is about to begin &mdash; seeing that you're still new to interstellar travel, best you find a seat and hang on tight.}}

:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' When I first woke up after being rescued from the ice, I could see clusters of stars in front of me. I reached out for them automatically, but they turned out to be the carriage ceiling lights.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Jumps are like this: They may feel novel the first few times, but you'll slowly get used to them after a few more.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' As for the mechanism... Well, if you're interested, I'll explain it to you in detail when we have more time.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' For now, just sit and wait. Remember to close your eyes &mdash; it helps with the dizziness.

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 120.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, don't worry about me. I just wanna see if I can stay on my feet this time~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good luck, I'm rooting for you.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Thanks. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The key is using your core, waist, and leg muscles. It's not your stance that matters, but your ability to ride the inertia...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't hurt yourself.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's fine, I'm sturdier than I look~ Besides, the ice will protect me.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' When I'm in danger, I instinctively create ice to protect myself.
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Though sometimes falling on the ice actually hurts more than falling on the ground.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you make things hard for yourself?
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't be silly &mdash; this is fun!
::{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I like keeping busy, otherwise I start obsessing over... pointless things.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, don't mind me. Find a place to sit down and buckle up.

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Our next stop is a small planet called Jarilo-VI.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's been thousands of years since the last time the Express paid a visit. The data bank shows it was a lush and beautiful place.
:{{A|VO chapter0 8 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' But after all this time, it's possible that dramatic changes have occurred.
