{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Master Control Zone|update|The space station's external crisis seems to be under control but the researchers remain uneasy.<br />Many of them were alone when they came here. What do they care about the most now? The space station? Their colleagues? Or is it the research itself?<br />It's obvious that everyone's answer is different.}}
