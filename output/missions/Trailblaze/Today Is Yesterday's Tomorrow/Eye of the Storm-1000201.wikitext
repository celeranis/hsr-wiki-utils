A woman's voice echoes in your head but you're in no position to confirm whether you can clearly remember it.<br />"When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret..."<br />You decide to first listen to March 7th and Dan Heng, who had just left. At least they don't look like bad people.<br />Alright, now that there are companions, it's time to leave this place.}}
