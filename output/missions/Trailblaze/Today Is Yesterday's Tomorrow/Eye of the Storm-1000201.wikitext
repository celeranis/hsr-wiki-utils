===Leave and see what's going on outside===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|You move your gaze away from the unfamiliar ceiling and look at the variety of Curios around you. A woman's voice echoes in your head but you're in no position to confirm whether you can clearly remember it.<br />"When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret..."<br />You decide to first listen to March 7th and Dan Heng, who had just left. At least they don't look like bad people.<br />Alright, now that there are companions, it's time to leave this place.}}

===Listen to March 7th and protect yourself===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You keep thinking about what March 7th said: "The Legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves..." It seems like the road ahead is going to be a hard one.<br />You look at March 7th beside you and she nods at you with confidence.<br />You then look at the baseball bat in your hand, which is glowing as if also full of confidence.<br />You can do it too, give it a try!}}

===Go to the upper level and take the elevator to the master control zone===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|Arlan seems to worry that he would be a hindrance, but you as a group already developed a sort of delicate rapport in how to persuade him. Could this be what it means to be companions?<br />Hurry and reach the top floor with your companions.}}

===Go to the elevator in the central area===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|It would seem that the only way to the space station's master control zone is through the elevator &mdash; it doesn't seem to be too far.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to the monitoring room and meet up with Arlan===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Just like in all those classic movie scenes &mdash; the elevator doesn't work.<br />Despite March 7th calling him a "walking encyclopedia," even Dan Heng, who somehow made it in time, doesn't know what to do.<br />However, Arlan, the head of the Security Department rescued by Dan Heng, probably knows the answer...<br />As expected, Dan Heng saves the day once more.}}

===Use the encryption key===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You can sense from Arlan's cautious gaze that the encryption key is not only used for unlocking authorization but also proof of your identity.<br />Hurry up and use it.}}
