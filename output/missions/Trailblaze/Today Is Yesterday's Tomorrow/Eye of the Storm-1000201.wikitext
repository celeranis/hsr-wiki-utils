{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|You move your gaze away from the unfamiliar ceiling and look at the variety of Curios around you. A woman's voice echoes in your head but you're in no position to confirm whether you can clearly remember it.<br />"When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret..."<br />You decide to first listen to March 7th and Dan Heng, who had just left. At least they don't look like bad people.<br />Alright, now that there are companions, it's time to leave this place.}}

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Storage Zone|update|You keep thinking about what March 7th said: "The Legion are rampaging through the space station like a pack of wolves..." It seems like the road ahead is going to be a hard one.<br />You look at March 7th beside you and she nods at you with confidence.<br />You then look at the baseball bat in your hand, which is glowing as if also full of confidence.<br />You can do it too, give it a try!}}
