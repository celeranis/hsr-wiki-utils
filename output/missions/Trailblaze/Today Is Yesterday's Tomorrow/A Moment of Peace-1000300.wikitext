:{{A|VO chapter0 3 himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' March, Dan Heng, you've been through a lot.
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whew, Himeko~ What took you so long! That last wave of Antimatter Legion came at us like a swarm of locusts, have you ever tried shooting locusts with a bow?
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I wouldn't have made a difference. My orbital cannon can deal with a whole bunch of enemies at once, but I couldn't just blow up the space station with it &mdash; Herta would NOT like that...
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Are you alright, Arlan? Asta's been worried about you.
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 arlan 101.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' I'm fine, a quick patching up will do. Thanks for asking. I'll report the situation to Lead Researcher Asta immediately. Bye.
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Hey, nice to meet you. I'm Himeko, navigator of the Astral Express.
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' In other words, she's in charge of where the Express goes.
:{{A|VO chapter0 3 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' March hasn't been any trouble for you along the way, has she?
