"When you have a chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret."<br />You haven't made up your mind yet, or could it be that you have. However, you're just not sure if anyone else shares your point of view...<br />It's alright. You can hide it deep in your heart and listen to what others think...<br />Is it possible that you all think the same?}}
