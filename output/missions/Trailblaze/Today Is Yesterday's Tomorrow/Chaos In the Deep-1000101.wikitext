==Steps==
# Use a fake identity to get past security check
# Go through the corridor and enter the interior of the space station
# Taking out a lone Voidranger is just a warm-up
# Meet up with Silver Wolf and leave the Reception Center
# Venture further following the route provided by Silver Wolf
# Clearing Voidrangers on the way is just like lifting a finger
# Something's not right about the Monitoring Room at the end of the corridor
# Assist Silver Wolf with investigating the terminals in the Monitoring Room
# She said something strange will happen if you touch the screen
# Get the Stellaron with Silver Wolf's help
# Leave and see what's going on outside
# Interact with the Curio to unravel the secret in the Monitoring Room
# Silver Wolf is nodding her head, seems it's not that simple
# However, Silver Wolf seems to have already understood it all.
