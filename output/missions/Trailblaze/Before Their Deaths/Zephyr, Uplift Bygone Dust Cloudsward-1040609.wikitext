===Return to Amphoreus{{subst:void|<!--104060901-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Holy City Lost to Time|Okhema, the last city, was a cradle of countless myths.<br />Once, she was like an innocent nymph, sheltered by law, draped in flowing finery, basking in sky's dawning light. She danced across the earth, listened to the ocean's songs, followed reason's teachings, slipped past suitors' trickery, untouched by strife or death. Through ever more beautiful passages she wandered, and people supported her in her worldbearing...<br />Until time took her joy, her beauty, her life, and more. A skeleton lies quietly in a stone coffin. Yet beneath ribs carved like white jade, her heart hasn't withered.<br />Wipe away the dust from that beautiful heart, and listen... listen to the heartbeat preserved for you.}}
