{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=The Former Grove of Epiphany|Complete your conquest in the ocean at the boundaries of this world, and eternally slumber in the sound of tides. Eternally slumber in the sound of tides, and complete your conquest in the ocean at the boundaries of this world.<br />They were never terrified of this prophecy. Rather, they somewhat looked forward to it.<br />Back then, they stood on the shores of Loukas, watching the yet-unextinguished sun sink into the sea, imagining the day when the prophecy would come true.<br />But she didn't know that the sea she dreamed of wasn't just a small pond. Nor was it just an empty shore.<br />She didn't know that she had no desire for eternal rest. And what she truly yearned for was never a conquest.<br />Thinking of the scenes that were so out of place, they watched together as the sun slowly, ever so slowly, sank into the sea, as if it would never rise again.}}
