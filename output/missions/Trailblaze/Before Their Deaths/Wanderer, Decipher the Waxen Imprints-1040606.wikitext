There, a strange Memokeeper tried to bewitch you, but was driven away by a visitor who looked identical to March 7th. The visitor called herself Evernight, and she handed over the modified Worldbearing Coreflame, sending you back to Okhema to continue your interrupted journey of deliverance.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Aedes Elysiae|update|Here, you'll hear no human voices, see no human shadows. The sun's flickering flames will scorch you, draining the color from your skin. Only when the starlit night shields you from sunlight, or when the Sun rises to melt away the morning frost, will you find relief. These present hardships will torture you forever, and no one can save you.<br />But you have left behind the fire... the fire that will liberate them. And the fire meant to free you was illuminated long ago.}}
