|summary       = Following the song, you awakened Hysilens, who had been waiting here, and faced the threat of Lygus together. Lygus revealed his true identity: He is the consciousness of Zandar, Genius Society #1. He intended to destroy Nous through Irontomb, liberate the Erudition, and trigger the war among the Aeons. You and Hysilens were no match for Zandar's boundless power, but Cyrene and the geniuses had already laid their trap, using the power of Remembrance to draw Zandar into a loop. You seized this opportunity to complete an Era Nova that would delay Irontomb's birth. Meanwhile, Hysilens learned of Cerydra's final thoughts before her sacrifice &mdash; The monarch of Amphoreus had left a gift for her, and an unknown chess piece for you. In addition, Dan Heng was confronting Evernight at an uncertain time and place. The origin of Evernight seemed closely tied to March 7th's secret...
