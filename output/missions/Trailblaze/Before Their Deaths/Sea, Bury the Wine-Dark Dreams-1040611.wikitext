In the face of Lygus's mockery, you chose to stand firm on your beliefs and continued the unfinished mission of the heroes.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location="Warbling Shores" Styxia|That day, a grand ship, laden with glory and five hundred heroes, set sail from Styxia and plunged into the embrace of towering waves shrouded in mist. Days later, the ocean fell silent, and for a thousand years, no wave rose again.<br />No one knows the story hidden in mist and waves. Perhaps, only the ocean remembers &mdash;<br />A single burning ambition ignited all the timbers laden on that ship. Ashes of emptiness drifted slowly to the ocean floor.<br />Go now, and feel that chilling flame, and those burning tears.}}
