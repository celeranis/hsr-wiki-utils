|summary       = Unlike Okhema, Styxia presented a beautiful sight. Lygus, who was imprisoned here, told you that this was a prison Hysilens created for him. But as Hysilens fell into a deep slumber over the long years, the prison transformed into a dream filled with her memories. On your way to the Vortex, you witnessed Hysilens's past experiences &mdash; She was once a Titankin of Phagousa, who lost the Titan and sisters who nurtured her to the corrosion of the remaining black tide. While wandering alone, she received an invitation from Cerydra and became the king's Gladius, finding momentary happiness and fulfillment in the Flame-Chase. However, at the end of the dream, Cerydra died by Hysilens's sword, the Flame-Chase failed, and all hope turned to nothing.

==Steps==
# Head to Styxia
# Come, seek the song on the shore that bears no fruits.
# Listen to the whispers of the tides, for they sing&mdash;
# "Among the distant cliffs, I see Helektra."
# Watch how that Chalice of Plenty shatters to pieces
# Follow the trail of honey brew, salt water and blood, keep searching for the song.
# Try to repair the broken path ahead
# Swim along the salty, rust-flavored currents
# Deactivate the Oronyx Orb
# Let the river blocked by time flow freely
# Use the Shrine of Prayers to enhance prayers
# Listen to the lament of the tides, for they sing&mdash;
# Repair the path ahead through the power of time
# "Oh please, spare me! God of Wine, have mercy!"
# Shatter the Chrono Vessel. Rewind the collapsed path
# Piece together all that was shattered, just as she once did
# Shatter the Chrono Vessel. Rewind the broken "Chalice of Plenty"
# Piece together all that was shattered, just as she once did
# Go chase the herds in the water, go gaze upon the mountain peaks
# Go sing a song for the sun sitting on the mountain&mdash;
# "Spare your heart the splendor of triumphs."
# "Please stay with us, long and in joy."
# "Do not return yet to the heavens, just a little longer."
# "Let not the wind claim you."
# End of Brew Play
# The drunken dream is over, sink to the bottom of the sea

===Head to Styxia{{subst:void|<!--104061001-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location="Warbling Shores" Styxia|Why would a father sacrifice his daughter? Why would a daughter slay her mother? Why do gods torment mortals? Why would an eagle cast a tortoise shell upon a poet's head?<br />In countless poems of the wine god, people rage, grieve, and despair. It was because the roots of these tragedies are elusive and impassive, beyond the reach of blade or noose. Just as sailors cannot slay the sea.}}

The oars are gone from your sides. The mast has snapped in the fierce southwest wind. The rigging groans with sorrow. No ropes remain. How will your hull survive the crashing waves? The sails are torn, and the divine statue has vanished.<br />&mdash; Beware. Do not let the storm toy with you.}}
