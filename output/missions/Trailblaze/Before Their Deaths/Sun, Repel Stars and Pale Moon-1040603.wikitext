|summary       = You and Cyrene returned to the era of the first Flame-Chase Journey, where you encountered Cerydra, the Chrysos Heir of Law, and Hysilens, the Chrysos Heir of Ocean. As the leader of Okhema, Cerydra welcomed you both and declared a war decree against Phagousa during the alliance council. Meanwhile, you also became acquainted with Hysilens at the Marmoreal Palace, learning that a grand banquet would be held before the campaign. During the banquet, however, Hysilens revealed Cerydra's hidden scheme to you &mdash; Lygus had used the power of the Irontomb as leverage to tempt Cerydra into an alliance with him. Hysilens hoped you could help her sovereign escape these malicious whispers. You eavesdropped on the conversation between Lygus and Cerydra at the banquet but were discovered by Cerydra. After a heated debate, Cerydra attempted to protect you under the pretense of detention, but Lygus intervened forcefully, once again banishing you to the Exomyth. Cerydra then summoned two geniuses to engage in a battle of wits with Lygus.

{{Mission Description|type=trailblaze|location=Aedes Elysiae|People say this is a cruel era stained with golden blood and crimson, an era of catastrophe where tsunamis rage and mountains crumble, an era of tyranny where corrupt rulers trample the law, a dark era where both gods and their faithful are slaughtered. This is the era of the First Flame-Chase Journey, an era with a scorching sun that burns with blinding light.<br />And you must gaze directly into it, asking it to illuminate the fire you seek.}}
