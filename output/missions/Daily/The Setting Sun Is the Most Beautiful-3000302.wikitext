;(Talk to Esther)
:'''Esther:''' Ohhh, there you are. I'm so sorry about that business with my hair last time...
:'''Esther:''' I didn't end up dyeing my hair. I'm so sorry for wasting your efforts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You didn't like the color after all?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did something happen?
:'''Esther:''' No... I bought the dye, but the color was different from what I imagined. The party was coming up, and I had no time to buy another one...
:'''Esther:''' I was concerned my girlfriends would laugh at me, so I decided not to dye it after all.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are your plans then?
::'''Esther:''' *sigh* I'll leave my hair as it is.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You already look good.
::'''Esther:''' Ohhh, there's no need to praise me. What's so good about white hair from old age?
:'''Esther:''' I get a headache every time I think about the party... *sigh* If I can't dye my hair, then maybe I can at least change my glasses.
:'''Esther:''' I see lots of researchers wearing contact lenses these days. I want to try them out, but I don't know which type to try.
:'''Esther:''' *sigh* I'm still too busy to get away... Could you please ask around to see what contact lenses are in fashion these days?

;(Talk to Researcher With Glasses)
:'''Tired Researcher:''' Um, what do you want?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Which type of contact lenses is in fashion these days?
:'''Tired Researcher:''' Um, I&mdash;I'm not sure. I've never used those.
:'''Researcher With Glasses:''' Just use normal glasses with frames. They're pretty good. You even look sophisticated in them.
:'''Tired Researcher:''' But it still gets inconvenient once in a while, right?
:'''Researcher With Glasses:''' At least it won't hurt your eyes this way.
:'''Tired Researcher:''' True. I would definitely get inflamed red eyes with contact lenses.

;(Talk to Tired Researcher)

;(Talk to Calm Researcher)
:'''Calm Researcher:''' Who are you looking for?
:'''Kind Researcher:''' Is there... anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Which type of contact lenses is in fashion these days?
:'''Calm Researcher:''' The ones with optical sensing capabilities? Those were in fashion for a while.
:'''Kind Researcher:''' No no no. In our space station, it's gotta be the Joint Tribute to the Genius Society lenses.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...That sounds weird.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is that?
:'''Kind Researcher:''' Basically, it's a lens with the picture of Madam Herta imprinted on it. I remember it was very popular.
:'''Calm Researcher:''' That was from more than six months ago... I'm not sure if it's still in fashion.
:'''Calm Researcher:''' Also, I'm pretty sure that type sold out ages ago. You can't even buy it with money now. Don't mislead other people.
:'''Kind Researcher:''' Umm, okay. I'm not sure what's fashionable anymore... Sorry...

;(Talk to Kind Researcher)

;(Talk to Fashionable Researcher)
:'''Fashionable Researcher:''' Hi... And you are?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Which type of contact lenses is in fashion these days?
:'''Fashionable Researcher:''' Haha, you've got good taste! I'm the right person to ask that question. See, the ones I'm wearing right now are the hottest and most popular lenses!
:'''Fashionable Researcher:''' Amber Starlight &mdash; With an amber-hued background and customizable, color-changing starlight patterns, it looks super cool when the lights are off. You'll be the coolest person all around!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? Don't troll me.
::'''Fashionable Researcher:''' Hey! I'm the bona fide fashion guru of the entire space station!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any other recommendations?
::'''Fashionable Researcher:''' Nope. This is the most popular style this season. No other options.
:'''Fashionable Researcher:''' C'mon, I may look plain, but my older sister is a designer. After having watched her for so long, I'm willing to bet that no one on the space station understands fashion more than me!

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (I finally got an answer. I should hurry and tell Esther the good news.)

;(Talk to Esther)
:'''Esther:''' Hold on, let me check... Oh, it does look good! But I feel it'll be difficult to re-create what they're showing on the ad.
:'''Esther:''' ...However, if I don't buy it, I'll have to wear this pair of wired glasses to the party. That's too old-fashioned.
:'''Esther:''' (Trailblazer), what should I do?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stick with wired glasses.
::'''Esther:''' Hmm, yes. Amber Starlight is too showy. It doesn't really fit me in my age.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Definitely Amber Starlight!
::'''Esther:''' The special effects are rather extravagant, but the amber shade is quite pretty. I am definitely tempted!
:'''Esther:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer)!
