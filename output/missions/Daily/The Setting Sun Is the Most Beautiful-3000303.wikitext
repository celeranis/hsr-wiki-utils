;(Talk to Esther)
:'''Esther:''' I have to thank you. My girlfriends at the party all said that I'm a fashionista now.
:'''Esther:''' They're really jealous that I have a fashion consultant like you. This time, they want me to ask you some questions...
:'''Esther:''' Two colors are really popular right now. Retro Glazed Bronze and Summer Blooming Forest... (Trailblazer), do you know what they actually are?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's just gold and green...
::'''Esther:''' Wow, I knew it. Your fashion instincts are sharp... You immediately understood those weird names.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those colors are everywhere in the space station!
::'''Esther:''' Really? I've never noticed it.
:'''Esther:''' So you're saying the space station already... has these two shades? But I don't remember ever seeing them.
:'''Esther:''' In that case, please help me take pictures of items in these colors and bring the photos to me, so I can learn about them as well!

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (This color looks fine... Esther wanted {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|gold}} and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|green}}.)

;(Unused &mdash; Photograph300030303_End)

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (I'm done with Esther's photos. Time to take these back to her.)

===Take photos of one gold and one green object each{{subst:void|<!--300030304-->}}===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Gold and green should be quite common. The {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|plants and flowers}} in the space station and the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Astral Express}} should be enough...)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Hand the photo to Esther{{subst:void|<!--300030305-->}}===

;(Talk to Esther)
:'''Esther:''' (Trailblazer), you're definitely a youngster. You think fast and act fast.
:'''Esther:''' But I really didn't expect this. Retro Glazed Bronze and Summer Blooming Forest... they sound so new and special based on the name.
:'''Esther:''' I really learned something today. They're just ordinary colors. I feel maybe this is a bit...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fashion is not real!
::'''Esther:''' I've always heard people say that fashion is just a trick, that it's not real. Looks like they're right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Over-hyped?
::'''Esther:''' With such ordinary colors... it's definitely over-hyped.
:'''Esther:''' You're right. But I feel... I can't digest all this information at once.
:'''Esther:''' This kind of contrast was fashionable when I was young. I didn't think it'd be back in fashion now.
:'''Esther:''' Fashion is so weird. It's all a big cycle... Tsk!
