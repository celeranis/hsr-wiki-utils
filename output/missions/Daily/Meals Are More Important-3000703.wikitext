;(Talk to Maintenance Engineer)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Hey, (Trailblazer), good timing. I have an idea about the robots' problems&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Enough ideas. Did you fix the robots?
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' I won't dare to take them apart without knowing what I'm doing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me hear it then.
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' It's like this&mdash;
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' I checked the main control panel on the terminal. I suspect some robots didn't have enough power or got disconnected from the control panel, and that was why they couldn't execute the deliveries.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' So, I rebooted the signal transmitter, and made sure the remote access signal is functional...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hold up. Just tell me the important bits!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you explain it to me like I'm five...
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Sorry, what I mean is, I don't think some of the robots are broken at all. They just need a reboot.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' So, can you help me to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew it. You just want me to run errands again...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Help you to reboot the robots?
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Hehehe. Thank you so much in advance.

;(Talk to Maintenance Engineer)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' See, (Trailblazer), I'm right! They just needed rebooting. Easy!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not necessarily. Some couldn't be rebooted.
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' No way!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're right, but...
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' But what?
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Never mind. Just tell me what happened, and I'll see what might be the cause.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Tell him what happened)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Oh, so it completely fits my initial hypothesis.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' (Trailblazer), I would never have made up my mind if it weren't for your help!
