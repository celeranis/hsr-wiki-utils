;(Talk to Moles Sidekick)
:'''Cunning Child:''' It's almost time for everyone to meet up...
:'''Cunning Child:''' Why aren't they here yet?
:A kid is mumbling something. She looks like she's waiting for someone.
:You aren't quite sure if you have seen this kid before, but she does seem very familiar. You are certain that, at some point in your life, you've also met a kid with a similarly sly expression written all over her face.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you waiting for someone?
::'''Cunning Child:''' Huh? You're the honorary member, aren't you, {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}} (Trailblazer)? What are you doing here?
::'''Cunning Child:''' Oh... I know! You are the person Boss Hook called to play hide-and-seek with us! Am I right?
::'''Cunning Child:''' Let's wait together here for the others to arrive!
::----
::'''Hook:''' Oh, it looks like everyone's here!
::'''Hook:''' We'll decide who's it by rock-paper-scissors.
::'''Children:''' {{Size|36|Rock! Paper! Scissors!}}
::'''Hook:''' Hehe... I didn't expect that I would be it!
::'''Cunning Child:''' Boss Hook is so scary...
::'''A More Cunning Child:''' Looks like it's time to go into serious mode...
::'''Not-Very-Cunning Child:''' Boohoo... The game's basically over already...
::'''Hook:''' Run as fast you can! Find somewhere to hide!
::'''Hook:''' ...But that's all pointless! For I, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, will find every last one of you! Hahaha!
::'''Hook:''' I'll say it again. The play area starts from this intersection all the way to the plaza! Hiding anywhere else is against the rules!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (Find a good spot to hide in this area.)
::----
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Don't bother her.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (Don't bother her...)

:You fix your eyes on this narrow alley. To be honest, you've been wanting to explore it for a while now, but the sense of justice in your heart forbids you from stepping into this place.
:Perhaps now would be an opportunity to check it out for the purpose of hide-and-seek. You aren't sure if this is against the rules or not...
:...But it really is quite a hidden location. It's a small alley, the kind that has been blocked off. Naturally, anyone would want to go explore what's in there.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll hide here!
::You make the decision quickly. The way you see it, there's absolutely no way you would find a more secluded hiding spot in all of Boulder Town.
::{{Black Screen|With this thought in mind, you hop over the rusted fence, and make your way into the pitch-black alley.}}
::You had assumed that something incredible was going on here. Maybe there would be a tall, thin bandit with wiry limbs and wearing a white, skin-tight suit, wandering around on stilts while committing crimes...
::Or perhaps the alley would contain a burly figure wearing black from head to toe, with a mask and a solid black cape. Their voice would be deep, as if it was smoked by hot Geomarrow mines, and they would dispense justice in the dark streets of Boulder Town as a vigilante...
::...Unfortunately, you find none of that. You feel disappointed and instead squat on a pile of crates in a corner, waiting for Boss Hook to catch you.
::'''Hook:''' Three... two... one...
::'''Hook:''' Ready or not, here I come!
::{{Black Screen|With this thought in mind, you hop over the rusted fence, and make your way into the pitch-black alley.}}

::Of course, this could just be a ploy to lure you out... kids who manage to get recognition from Boss Hook and join The Moles are definitely anything but ordinary.
::So, what are you going to do? Will you go home with the children and go to bed, or will you prove to them that you won't take the bait?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I give up, Boss Hook!
:::Just amuse the kids. You tell yourself there's no need to turn a game into a battle of wills.

:::'''Hook:''' I can't find you! Where in the world were you hiding?

:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was hiding in the alley.

::::'''Children:''' {{Size|36|You cheated!!!}}
::::'''Hook:''' Geez... Whatever! I, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great, did not explain the rules clearly... Anyway, honorary member...
::::'''Hook:''' I, Hook, have decided that you win! Here is your prize. Take it!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a secret...
::::'''Hook:''' A secret? OK...
::::'''Hook:''' ...
::::'''Hook:''' I'm really curious though...
::::'''Hook:''' Geez... Whatever! I won't force you to tell! Anyway, you win! Here's your prize. Take it!

:::'''Children:''' {{Size|36|Go home and get some sleep!}}

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why play if you don't intend to win? Stay hidden!
:::You play to win. That's the basic code of conduct for any professional player. Hide-and-seek is no exception!
:::And so, you remain silent, having decided to remain hidden in the darkness of the alley.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} Find another spot.

:{{Black Screen|Three hours later.}}
:'''Natasha:''' Oh? You're finally awake, sleepyhead.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you said something like that before...
::'''Natasha:''' ...Have I? Maybe. Anyway, we need to talk about why you are here...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did I get here...?
::'''Natasha:''' Umm... It's a long story.
:{{Black Screen|Natasha brings you up to speed.}}
:'''Natasha:''' ...The point is, when Sampo brought you to the clinic, you were already on death's door. I thought he was up to no good again...
:'''Natasha:''' Luckily, it was just because you hadn't eaten for three days. It looks like you've pretty much bounced back. Congratulations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} JUST because I haven't eaten for three days?
::'''Natasha:''' If someone passes out in a dark alley... that's about the least concerning thing that could happen.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thanks for saving me, doctor.
::'''Natasha:''' That's my job. If you want to thank someone, you should thank Sampo.
:'''Natasha:''' Just remember, when you play with Hook and the others next time, you don't need to play like it's a battle of wills...
:'''Natasha:''' You need to take care of yourself. Don't forget.
