;(Talk to Emily)
:'''Emily:''' Ha? Who are you? Who still flirts like this these days? Blah blah "the rumor this," ha &mdash; so tacky!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you please talk in a less hostile way?
::'''Emily:''' Why should I care about what you think? If I do, I might as well become the acting lead researcher!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No wonder people say you're difficult...
::'''Emily:''' They can say what they want. I don't care!
:'''Emily:''' If you've got something to say, just say it. What do you want me for?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Tell her the researchers' suggestions)
:'''Emily:''' Listen up, I don't care what anyone says about me behind my back. Just like Lesley doesn't care what people say about her!
:'''Emily:''' I'm Emily. This is the way I talk, and nobody is gonna change that!
:As Emily speaks, a shopping list of books slips out of her pocket.
:''The Art of Language'', ''Communication Skills'', ''The Communication Collection: 30 Ways to Capture the Hearts of Your Listeners''... You notice that the purchases are all addressed to Emily.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see you enjoy reading...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Didn't you say that you don't care?
:'''Emily:''' ...
:'''Emily:''' Whoops! That's annoying... I... I don't know what to do! People say I don't have good communication skills... I'm aware of that!
:'''Emily:''' But I... I can't change that quickly, and books only ever write about theory. In practice, it's all useless!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can coach you.
::'''Emily:''' Really? Coach me? But you look...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Reading is of little use. It must be practiced.
::'''Emily:''' Who doesn't understand that? B&mdash;But how do I practice it?
:'''Emily:''' Sorry, I just... got a little too excited when speaking.
:'''Emily:''' As you can see, my situation really is a tricky one... If I want to change it, I'll have to learn how to speak from scratch.
:'''Emily:''' ...Can you coach me? Like, if you want to chat with other people, how do you start the conversation?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about this...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello?
:::'''Emily:''' I'm concise enough when sending text messages, but if I put it into practice... Would people think I'm a weirdo?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's for dinner?
::::'''Emily:''' Seems... Okay?
::::'''Emily:''' "What's for dinner?"... This sounds very natural. The tone is kind and non-aggressive, and it seems friendly without being overly humble.
::::'''Emily:''' Looks like you're pretty good at this stuff! Thanks! I've got a meeting on right now... I'll try this out!
::::'''Emily:''' Um... If I have any issues later, can you help me remotely? Please?
::::{{Black Screen|Emily leaves in a hurry. You stay where you are and rest for a bit.}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It sure is windy today.
::::'''Emily:''' It's kinda stupid, right? The AC aboard the space station is so amazing that the wind would never get too strong. This won't do.

:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you doing?
::::'''Emily:''' Ah, this sentence. I used to say this all the time, but some people say it feels quite aggressive...
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello, excuse me...
::::'''Emily:''' Isn't that a bit too humble? It's just a chat. We're not asking for any favors here.

===Reply to Emily's message{{subst:void|<!--300060102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Storage Zone|update|Emily is starting to learn how to chat with people. Use text messages to help her revise what she has learned.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Emily)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you trying to break the record for drinking coffee?
::'''Emily:''' How... How did you know that? Have you heard about the story of that woman?
::'''Emily:''' Why am I surprised? People on Seed Isle never shut up. They keep bragging about the legend of Lesley's 11 Cups of Coffee.
::'''Emily:''' Whatever Lesley can do, I can do it too. And I will do it even better!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Understand this, I'm Emily! Even though technically I'm her sister, I hope you can get to know me as an independent individual, instead of associating me with that woman, like everybody else.
::'''Emily:''' I was only born a bit later than her. I am better than her no matter in talent or practice.
::'''Emily:''' As long as I am given the same opportunity, I'm sure I will be able to create my own legend on the space station...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About rumors on Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Coffee consumption? Research genius? These rumors are everywhere on the space station. Why do you have to come to me to ask? Are you trying to rile me up?
::'''Emily:''' If you're here to verify the validity of the rumors, I can tell you with 100% certainty that yes, Lesley is just a genius like that.
::'''Emily:''' But if you're thinking of getting any insider information or playing some weird games through me... I'm warning you, it's best you drop those thoughts right now!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
::'''Emily:''' That's a wise thing to do. Leave me alone. And stop prying on Lesley.
