;(Talk to Agnes)

::'''Agnes:''' "This sweet taste is like the first drop of water from the cracks of the ice when the river unfreezes after the Solwarm Festival, a bit of warmth amidst the bitter cold..."
::'''Agnes:''' What do you think? Doesn't this description give you an appetite?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Are you asking me?
:::'''Agnes:''' Yeah, do you see anyone else?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Maybe?
:::'''Agnes:''' You don't sound so convinced. I understand, you are saying "No."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a chance.
:::'''Agnes:''' Well, I can't blame you &mdash; it's my own problem. My writing is not good enough.
::'''Agnes:''' Darn it. What's the point of being a food journalist if I can't use words to construct a sense of taste and utilize synesthesia? By the way, while I'm talking with you, I have another paragraph here. Let me read it to you.
::'''Agnes:''' "The rich sauces are like an invading army, completely overwhelming the crisp and fresh taste of the salmon. The gentle aroma of fish has no choice but to surrender in defeat..."
::'''Agnes:''' How's that feel? A little too wordy?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should write a novel.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, a lot of unnecessary details.
::'''Agnes:''' I can't help myself, I used to be a literary journalist. Every day I was trying to add more adjectives to the sentence anywhere I could fit them. I wouldn't get my bonus if readers can easily deduce the subject, predicate, and object within three lines.
::'''Agnes:''' But then a new girl came and was better at filling in words than I was, so I made a career change. Have you read the cuisine section of the ''Crystal Daily''? I am the author of that section.
::'''Agnes:''' Honestly, I don't want to include all that garish garbage in my writing anyway...
::'''Agnes:''' I'm gonna put more work into honing my rhetorical skills. Well, enough about me &mdash; how can I help you?

::'''Agnes:''' Sorry, still scrambling to finish my article. Did one paragraph today, but I want to bin the whole thing already...
::'''Agnes:''' Need to put more work into honing my rhetorical skills. How may I help?

;(Talk to Chavez)
;(If {{cx}}<!--during performance 501027101-->)
::'''Chavez:''' Young person, look over here! Just two minutes of your time can save you from future losses!
::'''Chavez:''' Has a sneaky kid with dark blue hair ever come up to talk to you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...It rings a bell.
:::'''Chavez:''' You are likely a victim of the "Dark-Blue Scam"!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't that Sampo?
:::'''Chavez:''' ... Sampo? You've been scammed! That's just an alias. That means... you're a victim of the Dark-Blue Scam!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've never seen someone like that.
:::'''Chavez:''' You are likely a potential victim of the Dark-Blue Scam!
::'''Chavez:''' Take my advice, that guy is a serial scammer. Don't believe anything he says!
::'''Chavez:''' Here, take this. This is a tutorial on preventing scams written by the Dark-Blue Scam Victims Association. Read it carefully and if you have any questions, come to me!

;(Unused &mdash; Wait_Option_5010271_18)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I ask a question...?
::'''Chavez:''' Go ahead! It's our responsibility to help prevent the public from being scammed.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...the Dark-Blue Scam Victims Association?
:::'''Chavez:''' That's right! The members of the Association are all former victims. We are united to share what we have learned and help the public by raising awareness!
:::'''Chavez:''' The guide goes over case studies of those who were scammed by the blue-haired swindler. It is evidence of his evil crimes, a painful lesson that we predecessors suffered.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...How were you scammed?
:::'''Chavez:''' The first time I met that guy, he asked if I wanted a "parallel universe printer."
:::'''Chavez:''' Well, I asked him how the printer works... and he immediately started rambling on a bunch of smorgasbord about science stuff. I was almost caught up in it.
:::'''Chavez:''' Terms like parallel universe, Aeons, and parity anomaly... Swindlers love to use these words related to the universe and Aeons to scam people!
:::'''Chavez:''' I didn't believe him until he used it to print money. He made two bills with the exact same serial number...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much did you pay?
::::'''Chavez:''' Uh... the price isn't important. What's important is that you need to be careful, so the same scam doesn't happen to you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did the printer work?
::::'''Chavez:''' Of course not, otherwise why do you think I would have joined the association?
:::'''Chavez:''' Ahem, sometime later, after the counterfeiting scam, I bumped into that same blue-haired guy again in an alley in the Commercial District.
:::'''Chavez:''' I should have had the Silvermane Guards arrest him, but I was so angry and I needed an explanation...
:::'''Chavez:''' Instead, he asked me with a straight face, "Were you staring at the printer?"
:::'''Chavez:''' He accused me of not reading the manual and wasting such a genius invention. He even offered to refund the full payment so that he could find another buyer for the parallel universe printer.
:::'''Chavez:''' He also said, "If the operator keeps staring at the printer, the parallel universe transmission can't happen. The only way to avoid interfering with the transmission process is to observe it with the help of an aether lens."
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...So you bought an aether lens?
:::'''Chavez:''' Doesn't that sound reasonable? So I was tricked again by his apparent sincerity...
:::'''Chavez:''' Now I know that nine out of ten people who try to associate their products with any kind of parallel universe theory are scammers!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Parallel universes actually exist.
::::'''Chavez:''' Haha, are you kidding me? Do you really expect me to believe that?
::::'''Chavez:''' Or... are you working with the blue-haired guy?
::::'''Chavez:''' Get out! If you don't leave, I'll have Silvermane Guards come and arrest you!
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, I am soo scared.
::::'''Chavez:''' Laugh at me if you want, just remember what I told you... Be careful with anything related to parallel universes!

::{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all.

;(Talk to Dominic)
:'''Dominic:''' Normal it is, for you to have doubts in your hearts &mdash; because you look around yourselves, and you can't SEE Preservation anywhere; you cast your eyes hither and thither, and nary do you see ANY evidence of the very existence of Preservation.
:'''Dominic:''' ...And yet comes this very day, I shall resolve your doubts and let you feel the true grace of Preservation, let you marvel at the almighty will of the Architects...
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Keep listening...
::'''Dominic:''' ...Preservation is the embodiment of Qlipoth, and is with us all the time. It's the secret force that imperceptibly shapes our personalities, impacting all the important decisions that we make during our lives...
::'''Dominic:''' ...The reason why you struggle so to find it, is because Preservation's grace is integrated with the world we know, diffused throughout the air we breathe, refracted through the light we see. It has gently embraced us in its bosom since the very dawn of our existence.
::'''Dominic:''' The Admonishments of the Supreme Guardian remind us to never take Preservation's grace for granted! We must inherit the spirit of our Architect ancestors: To persevere and survive in this world of ours, and to bravely defy any calamities we face!
::'''Dominic:''' The Fragmentum and the Eternal Freeze &mdash; These are just bumps in the road on the path to carrying out the will of Preservation! O brothers and sisters, stand together with thine Architects and our Supreme Guardian! Follow in her footsteps &mdash; for victory is our destiny!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Listen to what the crowd is saying.
::'''Male Onlooker:''' Hear that? What an impassioned speech! Praise the Architects, as his words have reinvigorated my lust for life...
::'''Female Onlooker:''' ...Is it really as great as you say? If you ask me, these Architects just say the same empty rhetoric day in day out &mdash; and if you've got time for all this bluster, you've got time to help improve everyone's living conditions around here...
::'''Child Onlooker:''' Preservation! O praise!
::'''Senior Onlooker:''' I've been off for a big walk, and come back. It's still going!? Kids these days, they never shut up.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's enough for me.

;(Talk to Furdo)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You seem upset.
::'''Furdo:''' Huh? Is it that obvious?
::'''Furdo:''' Dealing with a bunch of ignorant old people, every day &mdash; you would be annoyed too if you were me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of legal issues do you help them with?
::'''Furdo:''' Legal issues? You think too highly of the people of Belobog. What they come to me for has nothing to do with the law. It's all complaints about daily life.
::'''Furdo:''' It's always the same thing. The complainant tells me they have been altruistic and taken the big picture into consideration and the offending party has taken advantage of them and is being ungrateful.
::'''Furdo:''' You can hear thousands of stories like this at Solwarm Festival family gatherings. Those stories are, in the end, moral blackmail, which I'm not interested in at all.
::'''Furdo:''' But I am a legal practitioner after all, so it is my duty to help the public get to know the law. Every time it gets to this part, they start to pretend like they don't understand me.
::'''Furdo:''' But who's to blame? After all, the law is always fair and impartial, showing favor to no one?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow. You have a hard job.
:::'''Furdo:''' I know, right!? I can't go on being a Roaming Judge for a second longer.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just hearing about it makes my head spin.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of cases do you consider important?
::'''Furdo:''' Corruption-related, with evil organizations or personnel involved. Or at least arms smuggling... or scams...
::'''Furdo:''' Forget it. Just pretend like I'm talking nonsense. Belobog is too safe to have cases like that. Even if there is a big case, it's out of my reach...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all.

;(Talk to Wallace)
:'''Wallace:''' Yes. I, Wallace Cambridge Limestein, wish to continue to seek true friends.
:'''Wallace:''' I've studied my failures and come to one conclusion: It's not my fault.
:'''Wallace:''' I have no other intentions. I just want to make true friends. It was the people I came into contact with... They were too cautious. Some of them had suspicions about my family background, and some held prejudices against me for no reason.
:'''Wallace:''' I believe that I will one day make friends all over the world as long as I continue to treat people with sincerity like all the Limesteins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I admire your confidence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your understanding of "sincerity" is pretty unusual...
:'''Wallace:''' Meaningless discussion can never be compared to real action. Come on, I've found a photo spot for today.
:'''Wallace:''' A photo needs a story to attract attention, and you're looking at a man full of stories. All you have to do is capture the moment when I exude charm.
:'''Wallace:''' Come and meet me at the fountain in the Administrative District Plaza. It's time to show you a different side of me.

;(Talk to Lavonne)
;(If {{cx}}<!--during performance 501023901-->)
::'''Lavonne:''' Great location in the outskirt of the city, energy and water already sorted out. For this fully furnished property with fabulous interior design, you need to bring nothing but yourself! High demand, limited supply! I'd want to take one for myself! Hey, you there! What are you waiting for?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm waiting for you to finish.
:::'''Lavonne:''' What else can be said? The price is unbeatable! I have friends in high places. You get my drift? My sources have told me that the price of this property will only go up in the next two years.
:::'''Lavonne:''' An increase of thirty percent... no, forty! To be honest with you, I'm being conservative here.
:::'''Lavonne:''' The actual number is at least this much. Don't look so scared. See what I mean here? I'm trying to keep it on the down low, because...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not looking to buy a property.
:::'''Lavonne:''' Sure, sure, young people are not in a hurry. I get it. Let's put it this way: From the perspective of an investor, we are not talking about a house to live in. It's an asset!
:::'''Lavonne:''' If I were you, I wouldn't miss out on this opportunity. Buy it now, wait for the price to go up and sell it. Easy money!
:::'''Lavonne:''' Tell you this, if you buy the property and decide to sell it at some point, no matter if you find a potential buyer, I'll list it for you 13% higher than the current price. You have my word.
::'''Lavonne:''' Trust me, I am the best local property agent. There hasn't been a house that I couldn't sell!
::'''Lavonne:''' I've probably said enough. Anyway, think about my proposal. Don't make a decision that you will someday regret.

;(Talk to Lila)
:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What creatures are there in Belobog?
::'''Lila:''' Cats and dogs. There are wolves and birds in the wild... That's about it. You'll have to check out the museum's specimens to see what other kinds of animals there were in the past.
::'''Lila:''' I heard that hundreds of years ago, Belobog had domesticated bears, and direwolves roamed the wild. They're no longer around though.
::'''Lila:''' But I believe there are other animals out there that survived the Eternal Freeze. I just have no way to prove it. Now, I have no choice but to study humans...
::'''Lila:''' Did you know that humans in Belobog have at least three different origins? But you don't seem to belong to any one of them. That's why I was so surprised back then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You must be mistaken.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're right, I'm an alien.
::'''Lila:''' Haha, I must've been researching too much... Ever since I got my hands on that book, my head's been in the clouds.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What book?
:::'''Lila:''' This ''Underground Encyclopedia of Zoology'' was apparently brought back from the underground by a Silvermane Guard. It talks about a lot of strange creatures.
:::'''Lila:''' Ever since I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how these animals must look like.
:::'''Lila:''' I really want to know more about these crystalline lizards, geomarrow olms, funeral worms... I want to know what they eat, how they reproduce... everything.

;(Talk to Manya)
:'''Manya:''' I just said I'm on break... Fine, if you insist.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of work do you do exactly?
::'''Manya:''' Excellent question! My job involves a little bit of everything, but vital to keeping things running smoothly in Belobog! You could say I'm the unsung hero of the city.
::'''Manya:''' I'm responsible for grassroots affairs in the Administrative District, listening to basic requests from people, and solving day-to-day issues.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} In that case, can you hear out my request?
::'''Manya:''' Of course! But you will need to reserve a slot. My work hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I handle administrative and civil affairs during these times.
::'''Manya:''' I'm currently on break. As a public official, separating professional and private time is of basic importance.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} How do I make an official appointment?
::'''Manya:''' Please fill out a form at counter 236 on the second floor of Qlipoth Fort. Then have a staff member stamp it at window 35 on the third floor.
::'''Manya:''' After stamping, please head to window 155 on the first floor and wait in line for the proof of appointment. The formal processing usually takes one month after the appointment has been made.
::'''Manya:''' To inquire about the specific processes, please consult the window staff when making the appointment.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You're just trying to slack off, aren't you?
::'''Manya:''' What would make you think that? But I don't blame you. Many have the same misunderstanding, thinking this is just a job where you can kick your feet up.
::'''Manya:''' A job where I just "Clock in, drink tea, read the newspaper, chit-chat with colleagues, and stare at the time, waiting to get off." But that's all nonsense.
::'''Manya:''' Please lose these false impressions of grassroots public officials. Our days are busy ones indeed.

::'''Nika:''' Can I ask you a question, about literature?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course.
:::'''Nika:''' Just one of those general questions. I'd like to hear your take on it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Literature?
:::'''Nika:''' Just one of those general questions. I'd like to hear your take on it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Pretend you didn't notice her)
:::'''Nika:''' Wait a minute! It won't take long.
::'''Nika:''' I'll get straight to it. How would you rate these two books, ''Snow Plains'' and ''The Three Trebles''?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I haven't read either.
:::'''Nika:''' What? That's a pity. These are must-reads on the list of "Books You Should Read in Belobog."
:::'''Nika:''' Well, don't mind me... I guess I can't expect everyone to be as educated...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Make up a generic literary critique)
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Powerful, stylish, and full of unexpected twists and turns, these two books demonstrated with their refined language the strengths of both authors.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Their attempt to question and explore the spiritual side of mankind is commendable but unfortunately falls short compared with some of the greatest works of literature.
:::'''Nika:''' Amazing! Words of wisdom from a true master.
::'''Nika:''' Let me introduce myself. I am Nika with the ''Crystal Daily''. Sorry to bother you but we are collecting petitions from readers to lift the ban on the ''Tale of the Winterlands''.
::'''Nika:''' It would be wonderful if you could sign here. Of course, feel free to raise any concerns...
::'''Nika:''' Ah yes, as a gesture of goodwill, I'll give you ''The Seven Wonders of Belobog'' as a gift!

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you about to go on stage?
:::::'''Celine:''' Oh, I have Miss Tamila to thank for this. I once starred as the lead in a new play, but the critics brushed it off as being too cliché.
:::::'''Celine:''' Thankfully, Miss Tamila and I are close friends now. She introduced me to an up-and-coming director, and, lucky me, he cast me as the lead in his next production.

::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you still in touch with Tamila?
:::::'''Celine:''' Absolutely, I'll always be grateful to Miss Tamila for her kindness.

:::::'''Celine:''' The music company holds her in high regard, calling her deep voice a "smoky tone" that's perfect for jazz. I haven't experienced that style of music myself, but I'm genuinely thrilled for her success.

;(Talk to Tamila)
:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:'''Tamila:''' As you can probably tell, my voice is rather low-pitched. The director is not very happy about that, so the theater hired a voice actress to "assist" me.
:'''Tamila:''' She is impeccable indeed... but I too was professionally trained. Never missed a day of practice.
:'''Tamila:''' Now I have to lip sync and act as if in a silent film. I can't help but think that maybe one day they'll get rid of me altogether...
:'''Tamila:''' What do you think I should do?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Work on your acting.
::'''Tamila:''' *sigh* That won't do. People come to musicals for the songs.
::'''Tamila:''' How embarrassing would it be if a musical performer can't sing with her own voice? It's ridiculous! I'll be like thespians who can't remember their lines and need others to read out the script for them.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not try acting in a play?
::'''Tamila:''' Both are theatrical arts, true. But the skills they require are hardly transferable.
::'''Tamila:''' Plus, musicals have always been my passion... I don't want to simply give up like this. I still want to give it a go.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Maybe find a project that suits your voice better.
::'''Tamila:''' I'm afraid it's not that easy.
::'''Tamila:''' You might not know this, but musical artists only look good on stage for a very limited period of time.
::'''Tamila:''' Once their physiques change or their voice becomes coarse, they have to bid the stage farewell. They'll call it "spending more time with the family," but everyone knows that's the end of their career.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You'll have to challenge that.
:::'''Tamila:''' Even if the theater agreed with me, the audience would not buy it. They have been quite honest in likes and dislikes.
:::'''Tamila:''' But you do have a point... people should be less judgmental.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are other types of musicals you can try.
:::'''Tamila:''' The theater manager is convinced that the audience is only interested in love songs aimed at teens. But it's possible that people's taste has changed and the management failed to grasp it.
:::'''Tamila:''' You know what? I'll see if I can bring some artists together and try some new things. How does that sound?
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Need to find a way to get your voice assist fired.
::'''Tamila:''' No, I want to keep my job fair and square. I have no interest in theater politics.

:::'''Old Goethe:''' Oh, that's what you're interested in? Goethe is my family name and Goethe Hotel is my family business. Well, it all began a long, long time ago.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you received any special guests?
:::'''Old Goethe:''' Well, it depends on how you define special guest. Many guests have stayed with us. Indeed there are a lot of stories.
:::'''Old Goethe:''' For example, a lady from a rich family escaped her wedding and jumped out of the window on the second floor in her pajamas. No one ever heard from her since...
:::'''Old Goethe:''' There was a couple who were theater celebrities. They appeared as though they were in love but they stayed in different rooms when they were here for their honeymoon...
:::'''Old Goethe:''' And there was a lady who would always stay in a single room when her family was at work. She was always drawing in her room. And she would cry every time she finished drawing. I wonder what she's been through...

::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Any recommendation on sightseeing around here?
:::'''Old Goethe:''' I'd recommend the Western District, which is known for its artistic atmosphere. The Golden Theater is right there. You'll find everything from celebrities to merchandise.
:::'''Old Goethe:''' But be careful, don't go on their premiere day. For example, shows with many fans like ''Beneath the White Cloak'' and ''Stardust Rose'' will make the area totally over-crowded...
:::'''Old Goethe:''' It's best to drive there. If you don't have a car... Alisa Avenue is right outside the hotel. You can take a tram or walk there along the track.

;(Talk to Regin)

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I do.
:::'''Regin:''' Good. So you are not completely ignorant.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know.
:::'''Regin:''' Hardly a surprise. I knew I had to dumb things down for you people to understand.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that so?
:::'''Regin:''' Of course. Now let's not get ahead of ourselves.
::'''Regin:''' All you need to know is that light is a particle. Terms like wave theory or duality might be too complicated for you. My point is: Particles carry information. Are you with me?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go on.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really?
:::'''Regin:''' Why would I fool you?
::'''Regin:''' Light as a particle carries information. Building on that, if I am exposed to light, I am exposed to information. My big universe time tunnel theory holds that the universe consists of multiple interconnected entities that are running in parallel.
::'''Regin:''' Say if in one universe I came up with ways to send messages and my "doppelganger" in another universe knew how to interpret those messages, it means, according to my theory...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That you can interpret messages sent from another universe!

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you really a scientist?
::'''Regin:''' Of course I am! What kind of question is that! Those jealous old nerds and hags in Belobog's academic circle refuse to recognize me only because my revolutionary findings will make them look useless.
::'''Regin:''' Geomarrow always rises to the top, it is just a matter of time before a talented scientist such as myself receives proper funding for my research. Alas, I have always been waiting for a patron to come along. It is painful to see my talent go unnoticed...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you not receive academic training?
::'''Regin:''' That just goes to show how ill-informed you are about the science community today. What can you learn from a bunch of self-righteous nerds who fight tooth and nail for money and power?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you are self-taught?
::'''Regin:''' Find it hard to believe? One day, the world will tremble before my big universe time tunnel! You'll see.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't have to make it sound so extreme.
:::'''Rossy:''' I bet you're not someone who follows the news. Anyone who is ambitious should pay attention to the world and think more, like I do. That way they can contribute to the development of Belobog!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure seem to have plenty of time on your hands.
