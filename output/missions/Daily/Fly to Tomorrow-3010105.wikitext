===Talk to Alina{{subst:void|<!--301042301-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Boulder Town|Alina, a girl in Boulder Town, is upset about something. Go talk to her.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Alina)
:'''Alina:''' Wow, did you come here for this? I am so happy.
:'''Alina:''' Yeah, something did happen. Recently a strange rumor has been circulating in the clinic that "If you write your wish on a piece of paper and let a pigeon carry it to the sky, your wish will be conveyed to Alina..."
:'''Alina:''' Don't you find this strange? They can just come to me directly. Why bother doing all that?
:'''Alina:''' As a result, there are now pieces of paper flying around the streets everywhere. Of course I am happy to get so many letters, but I'm also worried that this may become a problem for others.
:'''Alina:''' I don't want people to be punished. Can you please find that pigeon before Natasha finds out?

;(Talk to Alina)
:'''Alina:''' You didn't find the pigeon, but you found a strange paper ball? Let me see... is this...
:'''Alina:''' ...
:'''Alina:''' I see. I think I have an idea what the "pigeon" is now. {{MC|m=Sir|f=Ma'am}}, can you find more paper balls like this for me? I think there are three more.
:'''Alina:''' As for what's written on it... Well, I think I better keep this a secret for Julian.

{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Boulder Town|update|There are strange balls of paper scattered around Boulder Town. You begin to understand why Alina is worried...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Alina)
:'''Alina:''' So, you've found all the other paper balls? Please show them to me.
:'''Alina:''' Let me see. There's one from Eric, one from Romeo, now this one, plus the previous one from Julian... We've got everyone's "letters" here.
:'''Alina:''' So "let a pigeon carry it to the sky" just means "crumple up a paper ball and throw it into the air." Come on, can't they at least fold a paper airplane?
:'''Alina:''' This way, no one will get in trouble with Natasha. Thank you, you are the best!
:'''Alina:''' You mean how am I going to deal with all these paper balls? Hehe, just leave them to me... Of course I'm going to treasure their wishes.
