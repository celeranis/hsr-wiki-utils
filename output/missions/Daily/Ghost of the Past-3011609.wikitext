;(Talk to Nervous Silvermane Guard)
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' Ahh... Excuse me, could you help me fix this Barrier Generator?
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' I can't turn it on... There seems to be a problem with the wiring... But I don't know how to fix it...
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' I... only came to the front lines yesterday. I still don't know much about the Barrier Launcher... Can you please take a look at it?
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' I heard that a large number of monsters are approaching here... If we can't fix it, we're all going to die!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me have a look.
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' Th&mdash;Thank you!

:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' Ahh... It's fixed! Thank you so much!
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' The Barrier is activated... It can at least fend off those monsters for a while! I have to evacuate the civilians... You look after yourself. We can't have good folks like you die!
:'''Nervous Silvermane Guard:''' May Belobog stand forever! May the Supreme Guardian live forever!
:The ill-at-ease recruit gives you a bow of thanks despite his shaking body, then rushes towards the depths of the fort. You watch from a distance as his skinny form dissolves into broken light in the freezing Fragmentum.
