;(Talk to Emily)
:'''Emily:''' Oh yeah! The phrase you taught me last time was really useful, but if I try to keep on talking... I'd reveal my true colors once again!
:'''Emily:''' Once the conversation starts, how do I keep going on from there?
:'''Emily:''' So, I just want to ask you, is there any kind of catch-all phrase that can make any conversation continue smoothly and naturally?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's quite the request.
::'''Emily:''' Hahaha, do me a favor.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's pretty tough. Let me think about it...
::'''Emily:''' Please please please. You're a master of language, and you'll definitely come up with something!
:'''Emily:''' So? Have you got anything?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about this...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mmm, I'm all ears.
:::'''Emily:''' But what if people never asked me if I was listening or not? It feels kinda cringe...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ah? Really?
::::'''Emily:''' This... This one's great.
::::'''Emily:''' Mmm, mmm, this one's great, I think &mdash; If I'm chatting, I'll ask "What's for dinner?" followed by "Ah? Really?"
::::'''Emily:''' ...Nope, feels weird. Like I'm missing something...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then add one more phrase...
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go on.
::::::'''Emily:''' Hmm... Friendly enough, plus it demonstrates that I care about others. Not bad!
::::::'''Emily:''' Mmm, these phrases should be enough to deal with future conversations. Thank you.
::::::'''Emily:''' I've got a meeting coming up soon with the Department of Implement Arts... I'm a bit spooked about it. If I have any issues later, can you help me remotely? Please?
::::::{{Black Screen|Emily leaves in a hurry. You stay where you are and rest for a bit.}}
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're awesome!
::::::'''Emily:''' Flattery's a great idea, but isn't this too sudden? Got anything more suitable for a conversational scenario?
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go on.
:::::::'''Emily:''' Hmm... Friendly enough, plus it demonstrates that I care about others. Not bad!
:::::::'''Emily:''' Mmm, these phrases should be enough to deal with future conversations. Thank you.

:::::::{{Black Screen|Emily leaves in a hurry. You stay where you are and rest for a bit.}}
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay.
:::::::'''Emily:''' The tone's a bit flippant, and I don't think it's friendly enough.

::::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Exit}} I can't think of anything better.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please, go on.
::::'''Emily:''' This one has a strange friendliness to it. It sounds okay overall &mdash; but there seems to be a bit of sarcasm deep down?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ah? Really?

{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Storage Zone|update|Everything is difficult to start with. Emily is a little timid, so use text messages to build up her confidence.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Emily)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you trying to break the record for drinking coffee?
::'''Emily:''' How... How did you know that? Have you heard about the story of that woman?
::'''Emily:''' Why am I surprised? People on Seed Isle never shut up. They keep bragging about the legend of Lesley's 11 Cups of Coffee.
::'''Emily:''' Whatever Lesley can do, I can do it too. And I will do it even better!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Understand this, I'm Emily! Even though technically I'm her sister, I hope you can get to know me as an independent individual, instead of associating me with that woman, like everybody else.
::'''Emily:''' I was only born a bit later than her. I am better than her no matter in talent or practice.
::'''Emily:''' As long as I am given the same opportunity, I'm sure I will be able to create my own legend on the space station...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About rumors on Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Coffee consumption? Research genius? These rumors are everywhere on the space station. Why do you have to come to me to ask? Are you trying to rile me up?
::'''Emily:''' If you're here to verify the validity of the rumors, I can tell you with 100% certainty that yes, Lesley is just a genius like that.
::'''Emily:''' But if you're thinking of getting any insider information or playing some weird games through me... I'm warning you, it's best you drop those thoughts right now!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
::'''Emily:''' That's a wise thing to do. Leave me alone. And stop prying on Lesley.
