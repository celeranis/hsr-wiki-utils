;(Talk to Excited Miner)
:'''Excited Miner:''' Yo! You're here for a feed too?
:'''Excited Miner:''' Pity they haven't opened yet. Wanna wait for them together? I'm telling ya, I'm a regular here. Their Spicy Puffy Mushroom is an absolute treasure...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This shop is abandoned.
::'''Excited Miner:''' Hah? Are you pulling my leg? Aren't the lights still on?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can Fragmentum echoes eat?
::'''Excited Miner:''' What's a Fragmentum? What's an echo? I ain't getting whatcha trying to say.
:'''Excited Miner:''' Whatever, let's just wait. I reckon they're about to open up. I'll be starving if they don't...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Seems like he won't give up unless there's food before his face...)

:'''Excited Miner:''' What, you want me to eat this? This fried rice looks a bit nasty... Just look at this color. Um, you really want me to eat it...?
::'''Excited Miner:''' W&mdash;Wait! Don't shove it in my mouth argh... *cough*
::'''Excited Miner:''' *cough* What are you doing all of a sudden! Ouch... That almost choked me!
::'''Excited Miner:''' But this fried rice... It doesn't taste like anything. It ain't as bad as it looks, but it feels like eating mine dust...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I told you that you can't eat.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you see the problem now?
::'''Excited Miner:''' Did something happen to my tongue? What's going on? I don't get it...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have lost the physical body forever.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've turned into a ghost...
::'''Excited Miner:''' So... I'm dead?
::'''Excited Miner:''' Then how come I can still talk to you? Are you also...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're just a creation emulated by the Fragmentum.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a bit rude...
::'''Excited Miner:''' Yeah, alright. I don't really get what's this Fragmentum thing you talk about, but I think I understand...
::'''Excited Miner:''' So... I can't eat tasty food anymore? That's really sad...
::The man before you shows a lonely expression before dissolving back into the Fragmentum soil like a collapsing sand castle.

:'''Excited Miner:''' What, you want me to eat this? This fried rice looks pretty tasty. Did you make it?
::'''Excited Miner:''' Alright, I'm hungry anyways &mdash; It ain't smart to pass up food shoved in front of my face!
::'''Excited Miner:''' ...
::'''Excited Miner:''' This fried rice... What did you do with it? It has no flavor! It tastes like mine dust...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I told you that you can't eat.
