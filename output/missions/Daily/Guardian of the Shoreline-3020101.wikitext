{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Alchemy Commission|After the Alchemy Commission delve reopened, people honest and crooked walked betwixt each other. As such, the Pearlkeepers alone are no longer enough to patrol the beach. They have offered invitations to brave and noble volunteers for the task at hand.<br />Yueyuan the Pearlkeeper hopes that you can help patrol the beach... Seriously, though, who's the one that actually protects this place?}}
