;(Talk to Emily)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you trying to break the record for drinking coffee?
::'''Emily:''' How... How did you know that? Have you heard about the story of that woman?
::'''Emily:''' Why am I surprised? People on Seed Isle never shut up. They keep bragging about the legend of Lesley's 11 Cups of Coffee.
::'''Emily:''' Whatever Lesley can do, I can do it too. And I will do it even better!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Understand this, I'm Emily! Even though technically I'm her sister, I hope you can get to know me as an independent individual, instead of associating me with that woman, like everybody else.
::'''Emily:''' I was only born a bit later than her. I am better than her no matter in talent or practice.
::'''Emily:''' As long as I am given the same opportunity, I'm sure I will be able to create my own legend on the space station...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About rumors on Lesley.
::'''Emily:''' Coffee consumption? Research genius? These rumors are everywhere on the space station. Why do you have to come to me to ask? Are you trying to rile me up?
::'''Emily:''' If you're here to verify the validity of the rumors, I can tell you with 100% certainty that yes, Lesley is just a genius like that.
::'''Emily:''' But if you're thinking of getting any insider information or playing some weird games through me... I'm warning you, it's best you drop those thoughts right now!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
::'''Emily:''' That's a wise thing to do. Leave me alone. And stop prying on Lesley.
