:'''Senior at Leisure:''' Oh? Wait, kid. You're holding...
:'''Senior at Leisure:''' I have a similar gadget with me from before the war. It can help us talk to people across the skies and memorialize your surroundings in images. Pity it's broken now, and no one knows how to fix it anymore...
:'''Senior at Leisure:''' Kiddo, what you have in your hand looks similar to my gadget &mdash; Can I please ask you to give a good look at this thing?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course.
:'''Senior at Leisure:''' Thank you, kid. I hope this won't take a lot of your time.
