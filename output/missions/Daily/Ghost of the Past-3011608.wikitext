;(Talk to Cheerful Silvermane Guard)
:'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' The casualty figures are discouraging. If only we could invent something to reduce the casualty rate...
:'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Hello, soldier! I'm looking for inspiration for a new invention. I'm sorry I didn't notice you earlier.
:'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' So... What's the matter? If it is not too urgent, please submit a written report to my deputy and say it's for Richard Balakin.

:'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Oh, are these your design blueprints? Mind if I have a look, soldier?
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' ...
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Is this thing called... Life Transmitter? What an amazing invention...
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' With this, the survival rate for emergency treatments on the battlefield could be doubled. And it would also be used in field hospitals...
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Nice! Soldier, you have done us a great service!
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' It shouldn't be difficult to build it from your blueprints. If we succeed, you will be a hero to the Guards! Hahaha...
::The guard standing in front of you laughs heartily as if he has found a treasure. You can almost see his excited expression through his tightly secured iron helmet.
::As he thinks about how to materialize the plans in the blueprints, he paces towards the depths of the Corridor of Fading Echoes until the traces of his appearance completely dissipate &mdash; as if he had never been here.

::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Is this thing called... Simple Protective Gear? Hmm, not bad...
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Your idea is good, but... this gear doesn't seem to be as protective as our current uniform. And if we wear it outside the uniform, it may restrict our movement.
::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' Hmm... Anyway, I'll keep thinking along these lines. Thank you for your valuable advice, soldier.
::The guard in front of you puts his hand on his head in thought. You fancy you can see his deep frown even under his full-face helmet.

::'''Cheerful Silvermane Guard:''' But I personally think it's a very interesting invention, and I will follow your line of thinking and see if it can be made... Thank you for your valuable advice, soldier!
