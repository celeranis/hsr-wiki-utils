===Talk to Gunn and become a "Distinguished Teacher"{{subst:void|<!--300052401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Master Control Zone|Gunn, the founder of the Department of Galactic Geopolitics, comes to you. He wants you to teach a special student, and you're going to teach her some unique lessons...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sheila)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What action will the Department of Galactic Geopolitics take?
::'''Sheila:''' I'm just a guide. Specific policies and strategies will be decided by the founder, Mr. Gunn.
::'''Sheila:''' But I believe the Department of Galactic Geopolitics will certainly try its best to make up for this disaster.
::'''Sheila:''' If you are not well mentally, I can help you relieve some stress. This is the least I can do for the space station.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you usually do psychological counseling for everyone?
::'''Sheila:''' Normally I prefer to do thought experiments, such as short quiz questions.
::'''Sheila:''' Thought experiments can exercise people's mental capacity and help me understand them. It helps me to get along with the researchers.
::'''Sheila:''' When the crisis passes, would you like to have a try?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About Mr. Gunn...
::'''Sheila:''' Mr. Gunn is the founder of the Department of Galactic Geopolitics. He is very wise and philosophical.
::'''Sheila:''' I am sure you will gain a lot of interesting knowledge if you talk to him more.
::'''Sheila:''' Especially about Fool's Play. I don't think anyone will know more about it than him.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all questions I have.
::'''Sheila:''' It's my honor to answer your questions. Please contact me anytime if you have any further inquiries.

;(Talk to Gunn)
:'''Gunn:''' Judging from Sheila's performance yesterday, I don't think it was good enough. Of course, I appreciate your hard work...
:'''Gunn:''' But she is an android after all. I don't want to see her go astray and do anything harmful to human beings.
:'''Gunn:''' I reset her memory from yesterday... Today she is a blank slate. What she will learn today is up to you.
:'''Gunn:''' Please continue to be her teacher today and tell her a bit more about how to navigate our world.

{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Master Control Zone|update|Your student, Sheila, is an android, and you're going to teach her how to act like a human.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sheila)
:'''Sheila:''' Mr. Gunn... Okay, {{MC|m=mister|f=miss}}, please teach me.
:'''Sheila:''' Although I have mastered a lot of advanced knowledge, there is still a big gap between me and ordinary humans. I want to be a real human like everyone else.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any hobbies?
::'''Sheila:''' Learning is my only hobby. I can never feel like I have learned enough. I have a long way to go.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you usually get up to around here?
::'''Sheila:''' Learn cutting-edge scientific theories, support the department of Galactic Geopolitics and the space station, and... wait for Mr. Gunn to give me upgrades and maintenance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It seems you enjoy learning very much.
:'''Sheila:''' Yes, human knowledge and culture are endless. I hate not being able to finish it all in one breath.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Find exam papers for her and urge her to study.)
:'''Sheila:''' Oh, great, it's my favorite! {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, you are the best! Great, but please let me download the exam papers first.
:'''Sheila:''' Reviewing curriculum...
:'''Sheila:''' ...
:'''Sheila:''' Learning objectives achieved. All examinations passed.
:'''Sheila:''' {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, I have finished all the examination papers you collected before. Yes, even with the "Cosmos Secret Volume," although the calculation is a little complicated, I still got the highest score.
:'''Sheila:''' Mr. Gunn seems to have given me some sort of report to handle... or is it some research to be done? But research is not a recommended field of study within the current Galactic General Examination's criteria. I better tell him I don't have time.
:'''Sheila:''' {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, I have memorized all these textbooks about the cosmos's history, the chronology of relevant events, and notes. Do I need an additional written examination?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I get the feeling you've been led astray...
:'''Sheila:''' Not at all. {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, you taught me to use scores to measure the value of life. With such a precise goal, I feel my life has been enriched.
:'''Sheila:''' Uh, {{MC|m=mister|f=miss}}, is there anything else? I still have several papers to download from the terminal. If there's nothing else, I'll leave and do some exercises.
:'''Sheila:''' Oh, by the way, Mr. Gunn said that after today's lesson, he'd like you to go back to him and have a chat. Perhaps you should go now?

;(Talk to Gunn)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Is Sheila doing well?
::'''Gunn:''' It depends on how you define "well."
::'''Gunn:''' She doesn't remember what happened before and doesn't have anything to worry about, so I'd say she is "doing well."
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I think I saw Sheila again.
::'''Gunn:''' Yes. She's a guide in the Department of Galactic Geopolitics, and the Department can't function without her.
::'''Gunn:''' But you probably also know she is no longer Prototype 157.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What are your plans?
::'''Gunn:''' I'm getting old, and I don't have much that I want anymore. A peaceful life is good enough.
::'''Gunn:''' I might train some students if I have the time. I heard... that some young researchers are apparently very interested in working on androids.
::'''Gunn:''' Given an opportunity, I would like to teach them a thing or two... Ahh, after all, everyone has regrets.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
::'''Gunn:''' Good. Do come back more often to chat with me, child.

===Report the result of today's lessons to Gunn{{subst:void|<!--300052403-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=daily|location=Master Control Zone|update|Sheila has made remarkable progress in acting human. But you're not sure if Gunn will be satisfied with the result...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Gunn)
:'''Gunn:''' ... It's a little different from what I expected. Um... Should I back this up before resetting the data?
:'''Gunn:''' Alas, I am old and useless now. Look at me, I almost forgot &mdash; thank you for teaching Sheila how to act like a human.
:'''Gunn:''' You've been working hard all day. Here is a little token of my appreciation. You can take it as a gift from Sheila.
