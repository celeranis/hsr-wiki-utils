:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 137.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' They're moving quickly. Belobog is crawling with their agents &mdash; all they talk about is "asset evaluation."

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps you should gain some insight from others first?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I trust your judgment more than anyone else's.
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 182.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' In your eyes, the IPC may seem heartless or cruel, but in reality, we all have a story to tell. As for myself, I was born on a small, unremarkable planet at the edge of the galaxy &mdash; a place whose name is known only to the native inhabitants.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 183.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' My home planet was extremely resource-poor. To survive, people worked laboriously, manufacturing products for other civilizations in the galaxy &mdash; mostly in the chemical or heavy industries.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 184.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Given these circumstances, the natural environment of my home planet became increasingly harsh. I don't recall the exact moment when it happened, but people started wearing respirators just to walk down the street. All you could hear were the wheezing coughs of the people &mdash; day and night.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 185.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' My home was facing its demise. The relatively wealthy chose interstellar migration and started anew. The majority who stayed could only struggle on amidst sewage, acid rain, and dust, waiting for the end.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 186.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Finally, one fateful day, the IPC arrived on my home planet. They had the technology to repair our planet's damaged environment. In return for their help, they asked for just one thing &mdash; that all inhabitants sign a contract which would make them employees of the IPC.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 187.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Two years after signing the contract, the dark clouds and haze disappeared, and people began to take off their masks. After three years, vegetation and trees began to grow and thrive again. After five years, many animals &mdash; previously on the brink of extinction &mdash; reappeared.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 188.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' When I was finally old enough, I officially became a member of the Strategic Investment Department. I witnessed the changes that took place on my home world and was determined to bring the same changes to many other worlds in the galaxy that were experiencing the same plight.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 189.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I am writing to you, Miss Bronya, with the genuine desire to express something important...
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 190.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I know freedom is precious to people, but in reality there are things of much greater value... such as survival.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 191.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' How many generations of Belobogians will it take to embrace the stars again without assistance? Who can guarantee that every future Guardian will be as prudent and enlightened as you? How can you guarantee that a disaster such as the Stellaron Crisis will not descend upon Belobog yet again?
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 192.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I have already negotiated the best possible deal for you. Once you sign this contract, all of Belobog's debts will be forgiven. In addition, the IPC will set up a special team to support the reconstruction of Jarilo-VI.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 193.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I can understand that for you, this is an extremely difficult decision, because you, and you alone will bear the fate of all Belobogians.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 194.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' But because of this, I believe that you will make the right decision &mdash; a decision that will truly benefit your people.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 261 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 261 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Her words do sound quite sincere... What do you make of it, (Trailblazer)?
:I think so, too.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 144.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I'm inclined to agree... It's hard to imagine she wrote that letter just to deceive me.
:She has a way with words.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 145.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Yes... she is a high-ranking member of the IPC, after all. She knows how to use words to her advantage.
:She's a smooth talker, but that doesn't mean she's telling the truth.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 146.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I agree, but it struck me as an honest letter &mdash; I found the contents quite moving. It's hard to imagine she'd write something like this just to deceive me.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 147.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' In any case, she wasn't wrong when she said this would be an extremely difficult decision.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 148.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' This planet's fate, the civilization it carries, everything that has happened here and everything that will happen... it all rests in my hands...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 149.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' This definitely can't &mdash; and shouldn't &mdash; be a decision made by me alone.
:Perhaps you should gain some insight from others first?
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 150 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp bronya 150 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' That thought has crossed my mind, and it comforts me to hear you say that, (Trailblazer).
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 262.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right? I don't think it's fair for you to carry the weight alone. Why not discuss it with others first?
:I trust your judgment more than anyone else's.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 263.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I trust her judgment too, but...
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 264.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What if this decision is too much for one person? The impact of this choice could haunt Bronya for the rest of her life.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 151.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Topaz hasn't given me much time to consider. She wants me to decide as soon as possible.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 152.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I wanted to put it to a vote, and let all the citizens of both the Overworld and the Underworld have their say. But with such little time, I'm afraid that's a lost cause.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 153.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I'll convene the Qlipoth Fort Architects immediately to discuss the contract. As for the locals, I'd like you to gauge their stance on the matter.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 154.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The people of Belobog hold both of you in high regard. They'll most certainly be willing to tell you their thoughts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's time to race against the clock.
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 187.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Two years after signing the contract, the dark clouds and haze disappeared, and people began to take off their masks.

:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 267.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Alright, if we want to make an informed decision, we need to hear from both the Overworld and the Underworld, right?

:{{A|VO side1 tp serval 110.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Surprised? My reasons are pretty simple.
:{{A|VO side1 tp serval 111.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." For most of the residents here, especially those in the Underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.

::{{A|VO side1 tp serval 111.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Signing this contract would mean we no longer have to worry about "surviving." For most of the residents here, especially those in the Underworld, that would be more than enough to persuade them.
::{{A|VO side1 tp serval 112.ogg}} '''Serval:''' As for working for the company, pfft, people need to work no matter where they are, right? If the IPC tries to take too many liberties, we can always rise up against them!

;(Talk to Bronya)
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 207.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Miss Topaz, you mentioned accountability...
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 241.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Don't worry, it's nothing I can't handle. There are more important things than titles and ranks &mdash; finding the best solution is what matters most.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will they cut your pay?
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 242.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' If that's what they want to do, then so be it. I've long passed the stage of working just for money.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Won't you get fired?
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 243.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Haha, that's unlikely. At most, they might lower my rank and reduce my bonus a bit. But don't worry, I work for far more than just a paycheck.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 208 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp bronya 208 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Thank you so much for all you've done, (Trailblazer). I never thought we'd drag the Express into a crisis again, much less one that might cause a rift between you and the IPC.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 244.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' A rift? I wouldn't go that far. Also, it's me who's mostly to blame &mdash; I didn't keep my subordinates in check.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mind putting in some good words for me with your bosses?
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 245.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh? Thinking about a career change?
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 246 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp topaz 246 f.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Sure thing! I'll put in the best words I can, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it true the IPC requires you to go through 17 rounds of interviews?
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 247.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' 17? Oh... I think I might know who you're talking about.
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 248.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' You could say he's a special case. For most people the interview process is much shorter.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 209.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Hehe, I'm glad we're able to discuss some lighter topics.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 210 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp bronya 210 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' (Trailblazer), you all need some rest after everything you've been through. I've arranged rooms for you all at the Goethe Hotel.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 211.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Miss Topaz, if you need somewhere comfortable to stay...
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 249.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I appreciate the offer, but I need to head back and deliver my reports.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 250 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp topaz 250 f.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' (Trailblazer), Miss Bronya, it's been great getting to know you both. I hope we can work together again in the future... only next time under better circumstances!

:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 339.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Phew, I was worried things were gonna get ugly again. A peaceful solution is always the best solution.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 340.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Speaking of solutions... Are they repairing that giant robot &mdash; the one we fought against? I remember you took control of it and helped us defeat Cocolia!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wonder if we'll have time to celebrate the Solwarm Festival.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 341.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right! I'd totally forgotten &mdash; that's the whole reason we came here in the first place!
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 342.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Looks like everyone in the city's helping with construction &mdash; doubt there'll be much time for celebrating. Still, look on the bright side &mdash; we got to meet a top IPC executive! The trip wasn't a complete waste, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I hope Topaz's negotiations go smoothly.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 343.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Miss Topaz is definitely up to the job! She has that aura of... what's the word... invincibility!
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 344.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, we didn't get to enjoy the festivities this time round, but at least we still got to meet a top IPC executive!

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 131 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp himeko 131 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Y'know, (Trailblazer), I'd heard you and March speak highly of the Supreme Guardian before, but seeing her methods firsthand left me in awe.
:{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 132.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' We should also be glad that Miss Topaz is the one in charge of the Jarilo-VI project. If it were someone else from the Strategic Investment Department, things might have gotten... complicated.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you mean, Himeko?
::{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 133.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Strategic Investment Department comprises the IPC's most elite employees, many of whom can be very... forceful.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You mean Topaz didn't make things complicated enough?
::{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 134 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp himeko 134 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That tells me you really don't understand the Strategic Investment Department, (Trailblazer).
:{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 135.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Let's talk about this later when you're back on the Express. You and March must be tired after such an incredible journey &mdash; it's time you got some well-deserved rest.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 345.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I've been wondering, how did you figure out what was happening here on Belobog, Himeko?
:{{A|VO side1 tp himeko 136.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well, you know, keeping an eye on the crew is just another part of a navigator's job.
