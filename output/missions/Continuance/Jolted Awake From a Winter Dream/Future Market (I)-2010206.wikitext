:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 182.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Is everything all right, Bronya? I didn't know Miss Topaz was so... intense. She seemed nice when we met her.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp bronya 102 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' It's good to see you two again, welcome back to Belobog. I'd planned a special reception, but I had to deal with an unexpected guest &mdash; the lady you just witnessed. She claims to represent the IPC...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 103.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' There's no need to keep either of you in the dark. To tell the truth, I've too much weighing on my mind right now to even think about the Solwarm Festival.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What exactly did Miss Topaz say to you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I only heard the word "Debt."
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 104.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Mm... Since you've already made her acquaintance, I needn't explain who she is.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 105.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I'm sure you heard pieces of Belobog's history the first time you visited &mdash; the Legion's invasion 700 years ago, how the Stellaron brought about the Eternal Freeze...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 106.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' It seems that much of Belobog's history from that time was buried deep beneath the snow. Those memories were lost and weren't passed down to the subsequent generations of Supreme Guardians.
----
:{{tx}}
----
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 183.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wow, that's a pretty incredible story. So... does that mean Topaz's "business" here is to collect a debt from Belobog?
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 111.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Yes... I'm afraid so.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 184.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's ridiculous! And what's with the timing? What took them so long to get here? If it wasn't for us eliminating the Stellaron, they'd have nothing to collect! It's obvious they're just trying to take advantage.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 112.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' According to her account, the repayment period agreed upon by the Architects and the IPC investors was... 280 years. However, less than a century after the loan was taken out, the connection between Jarilo-VI and the rest of the galaxy was completely severed.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 113.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The IPC deemed that the disaster had caused irreparable damage and that there was no civilization left to reclaim the debt from. As such, they considered the owed sum permanently lost...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 114.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...It wasn't until the Stellaron crisis was resolved that the IPC discovered that Belobog had survived...
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 185.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' And that's when they sent Topaz over to collect the debt...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 115.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...And the interest.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much is owed?
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 116.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' An astronomical amount. I don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happens if you don't pay it off in time?
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 117.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The debt owed is an astronomical amount. I don't even know how to read such a long string of numbers.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 118.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Before you both arrived, Topaz warned me that if payments were delayed, the IPC would give her the authority to employ "strong measures."
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 186.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I had no idea things were like this. Here I was thinking the IPC had come to rebuild Belobog, not extort it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like we'll have to intervene.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 187.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! We have to help Bronya out! The IPC is too big and powerful &mdash; the Belobogians won't be able to resolve this problem on their own.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I doubt the Belobogians can do anything about this on their own...
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 188.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right, we need to figure out how to help them. The IPC is too big and powerful &mdash; even if Bronya steps in, it'll be hard for her to resolve the situation...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 119.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' You seem to have a deeper knowledge of the Interastral Peace Corporation than I do, but if the records are accurate and they truly have a presence throughout the galaxy, the IPC could crush Belobog like a bug if they wanted to.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 120.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' I'm glad you're both here &mdash; I know you came for the festival, but now...
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 121.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...Now I must ask you and the Astral Express for help. Do you think you could persuade Topaz to reevaluate the situation? The Express' reputation precedes it, perhaps there's still hope...
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 189.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Have no fear, Bronya! When a friend's in need, the Nameless will always be at their side!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go have a chat with Topaz.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 190 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 190 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, after all, (Trailblazer) is a pretty good negotiator.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's bring out the big guns.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 191.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh... I don't think we're at that stage yet. Miss Topaz seems like a reasonable person.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 192 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 192 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' With (Trailblazer)'s silver tongue, I'm sure we'll make some progress.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 122.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Thank you so much, both of you. I'm so sorry for dragging you into more trouble.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 123.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' While you're out looking for Topaz, I'll see if I can think of a strategy to deal with the situation. Best of luck, and stay safe.

:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 193 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 193 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), I just remembered Topaz gave me her number.
::{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 194.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We might as well just be direct and ask her where she is. She seems like the type of person who appreciates a straight approach.

;(Talk to Bronya)
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 124 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 tp bronya 124 f.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' (Trailblazer), I apologize for dragging you into Belobog's affairs again, but when faced with an entity as powerful as the IPC, we need all the external help we can get.
:{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 125.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' While you're out looking for Topaz, I'll see if I can think of a strategy to deal with the situation. Best of luck, and stay safe.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Can you tell me again why Topaz is here?
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 107.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Topaz shared with me the story of the Stellaron's descent upon Jarilo-VI &mdash; how the original outsiders stationed here foresaw the impending disaster and chose to leave in large numbers.
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 108.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' Among those outsiders were several investors from the Interastral Peace Corporation. Before they departed, they did something noteworthy...
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 109.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' They sought out Architects who refused to leave &mdash; those who insisted on defending their homes. The IPC provided these Architects with significant funds to aid them against the coming disaster.
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 110.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' It was with those funds that Belobog was able to construct its immense walls... Even the initial funding for the development of the first batch of automatons was drawn from the same pool.
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 130.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' According to her account, the repayment period agreed upon by the Architects and the IPC investors was... 280 years. However, less than a century after the loan was taken out, the connection between Jarilo-VI and the rest of the galaxy was completely severed.
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 131.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The IPC deemed that the disaster had caused irreparable damage and that there was no civilization left to reclaim the debt from. As such, they considered the owed sum permanently lost...
::{{A|VO side1 tp bronya 132.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' ...It wasn't until the Stellaron crisis was resolved that the IPC discovered that Belobog had survived...
