:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 124.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh! It's you two again. This is the third time today we've run into each other.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cherish the moment...
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 125.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Why, of course I will! Meeting friends from the Astral Express is always a moment worth cherishing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, we sent you a message.
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 126.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh, did my Smart-Reply function tell you where I was? It's a system developed by the Technology Department. Pretty neat, right?
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 127.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' What do you make of this painting? I'm no expert, but just from the artist's strokes I can tell it's no ordinary piece.

:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 128.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' It portrays a certain kind of... sorrow, you know? Not your everyday kind of sadness &mdash; it runs much deeper than that.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 129.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' It's as if the artist has condensed history into one poignant, but sorrowful image. The artist's brushwork depicts a generation's &mdash; no, several generations' hardships...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems like you know your art...

::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 130.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Not at all, the analysis of an aficionado. I wouldn't take my word for it.
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 131.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' The Express has visited many worlds. I'm sure the Nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was thinking the exact same thing.

::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 132.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Haha, you flatter me! The Express has visited many worlds. I'm sure the Nameless have a far greater knowledge of such things than myself.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 133.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I suppose what I'm trying to say is, what I'm drawn to isn't the style in which a piece is painted, but its overall value. Its intrinsic value may only be 50,000 credits, but its "added value" might push the total up to 200,000.
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 197.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh... Sorry for crashing your artist party, but we came to talk to you about something else...
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 134.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh? A collaboration between our two sides, perhaps?
:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 198.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Not exactly. Actually, we&mdash;
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 135.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Let's walk and talk &mdash; this way!

:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 209.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... what now? We spent ages trying to convince her and she didn't move an inch!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She sort of made sense...

:{{A|VO side1 tp mar7th 213.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I guess Miss Topaz is just doing her job. And as far as the Express is concerned, I think it'd be unwise to make the IPC our enemy.
