:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cherish the moment...
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 125.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Why, of course I will! Meeting friends from the Astral Express is always a moment worth cherishing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, we sent you a message.
::{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 126.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh, did my Smart-Reply function tell you where I was? It's a system developed by the Technology Department. Pretty neat, right?
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 127.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' What do you make of this painting? I'm no expert, but just from the artist's strokes I can tell it's no ordinary piece.

:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 128.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' It portrays a certain kind of... sorrow, you know? Not your everyday kind of sadness &mdash; it runs much deeper than that.
:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 129.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' It's as if the artist has condensed history into one poignant, but sorrowful image. The artist's brushwork depicts a generation's &mdash; no, several generations' hardships...

:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 133.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' I suppose what I'm trying to say is, what I'm drawn to isn't the style in which a piece is painted, but its overall value. Its intrinsic value may only be 50,000 credits, but its "added value" might push the total up to 200,000.

:{{A|VO side1 tp topaz 134.ogg}} '''Topaz:''' Oh? A collaboration between our two sides, perhaps?
