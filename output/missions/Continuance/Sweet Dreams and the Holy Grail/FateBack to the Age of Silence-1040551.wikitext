His dream of becoming a great director was crushed by a lack of talent, leaving behind a heart aged far too young, consumed by insecurity and obsession. Who would've thought that the key to unlocking both his Noble Phantasm and his emotional wounds would be a tasteless, cross-era fan meet-and-greet?
