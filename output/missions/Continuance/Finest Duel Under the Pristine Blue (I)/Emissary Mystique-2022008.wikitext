{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Palace of Astrum|With Yanqing welcoming you, you returned to the Xianzhou Luofu, where you have been away for a &mdash; um, not a particularly long time &mdash; to participate in the upcoming Wardance.<br />The general awaits your arrival in the Palace of Astrum. What kind of task will he use to "welcome" the guests from the Express? Just thinking about it is making you feel the tiniest bit of flutter.}}

:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 104.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Don't worry. You're just in time. It's been a while, my friends from the Astral Express!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How's everything going, General?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 105.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' All is well when you have friends coming from afar.
::I dreamed about you on Penacony.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 106.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Oh? Well It's an honor to be in your dreams, my friend.

:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 107.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Sure, how couldn't I have? It's not often we find such moments to reunite and enjoy one another's presence.

:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 120.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' A lot must have happened without our knowledge. At least I hope that's the case...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 108.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Allow me to introduce you to General Huaiyan. He's the Arbiter-General of the Xianzhou Zhuming, known as the Flaming Heart.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 102.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Hehe, no need to be so formal. I'm just a tourist here, no different from other tourists who've come to attend the ceremony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 109.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Elder Huaiyan is not only one of the Arbiter-Generals but also the Furnace Master of the Artisanship Commission. Besides his martial skills, he excels in forging various weapons. Such talents are unique, even among the Arbiter-Generals.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 103.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Be it Arbiter-General or Furnace Master, these are merely titles given to me long ago. I've retired several times already, but with the current change in circumstances, the Marshal has called me back to duty, and I had no choice but to answer the call.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 104.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Well, in the end, I'm to blame. Living such a long life naturally brings its share of disapproval.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 121.ogg}} '''Dan Heng & Yanqing:''' It's an honor to meet you, General Huaiyan.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 143.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's my honor to meet you, General Huaiyan...

;(Talk to Yanqing)

::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 162.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' This is the report Qingzu just sent me. Let me take a look...

::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 164.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 165.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Looks like the general has given me a tough challenge. He wants me to try and help put the IPC's mind at ease.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this some kind of test from the general?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 166.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Well, it's not exactly a "test." As Cloud Knight officers, we not only learn the art of war and martial arts but also occasionally have to handle diplomatic disputes.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 167.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' It's just, you know... Talking things out isn't as straightforward as duking it out with weapons on the battlefield. This is especially true when you're up against the IPC, with their non-stop corporate babble.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 168.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Well, let's not worry about that for now. Shall I take you to the inn?

::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 118.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Not at all. Taunted by Yunli like that, even a training dummy would be angry. You've taught your apprentice well. If it were me in my younger days, I'm afraid I'd have drawn my sword and fought.
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 202200806-->)
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 119.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Yanqing can understand your concerns. On the other hand, Yunli is still a naive girl who's only interested in swordplay. Honestly, I brought her here to participate in the Wardance because I want to broaden her horizons.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aren't you coming with us?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 124.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I have some things to do. Besides, little Yanqing doesn't seem too happy about me tagging along.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He shouldn't have said you "stole" his sword.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But you did take his sword...
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 125.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You're right. I "took" it with my skills, so I guess you can say I'm a robber or something. How dare he imply I'm a thief. Totally different!

::{{tx}}

;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 145.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, Dan Heng, I thought all the Xianzhou generals were like Jing Yuan...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 146.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But that General Huaiyan, he looks... so thin and scraggy, as if even a light breeze would knock him over. Is that old man really an Arbiter-General?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 124.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Each Xianzhou ship has its own division and specialty within the Alliance, not all of the Arbiter-Generals are good at leading the charge. You heard what Jing Yuan said, right? General Huaiyan was once the head of all the skilled craftsmen on the Zhuming.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There appears to be more than meets the eye.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 147 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 147 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't you find it strange, (Trailblazer)? Do Xianzhou people age? I rarely see any old people on the Xianzhou ship, and when I do, they're usually travelers.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 148.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But... General Huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. Is he really a Xianzhou general?
::Why does he look so old?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 149.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, you've noticed that too. It's really weird... Do the Xianzhou people age? I rarely see any old people on the Xianzhou ship, and when I do, they're usually travelers.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 150.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But... General Huaiyan looks like an ordinary old grandpa. Is he really a Xianzhou general?
::Perhaps he's a robot.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why does he look so old?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 149.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, you've noticed that too. It's really weird... Do the Xianzhou people age? I rarely see any old people on the Xianzhou ship, and when I do, they're usually travelers.

::Perhaps he's a robot.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps he's a robot.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 151.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Like Madam Herta? Hmmm, that would make sense. Anyway, it's really weird for a Xianzhou native to look so old.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 125.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Good question. He's right there, so why don't you ask him yourself?
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 169.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Drat, I forgot to ask Yunli to return my sword...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll go get it back for you.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 170.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' No need to bother. The Zhuming envoys won't be leaving the Luofu anytime soon. I'll ask for it later when we meet again.
::I don't think you'll ever get your sword back!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think you'll ever get your sword back!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 171.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Unacceptable! Every sword is precious to me!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 172.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' If it weren't for the general's interference, I would have taught that shameless girl a lesson in swordplay...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 173.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' By the way, I don't know if it's just me, but the general seemed a little... hmmm, reserved? Could it be because of Elder Huaiyan's visit?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 153.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Reserved? Really?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 174.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Maybe I'm just overthinking things.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 127.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' No, you're not. When I entered the Palace of Astrum, I realized that the messenger from the Xianzhou Zhuming was actually the Arbiter-General himself. So, the messenger from the Xianzhou Yaoqing must be the Merlin's Claw herself, I presume?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 175.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' That's right.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 128.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's what makes this entire thing so unusual.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 154.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What's so unusual about it? They simply received an invitation from Jing Yuan, just like the Crew, right?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 129.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The Wardance is just a small festival, and now we have two Arbiter-Generals from other Xianzhou ships here. I'm afraid they're here for something more.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 130.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Maybe they've come to hold Jing Yuan accountable for the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 155.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hold him accountable? Come on, didn't the Luofu fall victim to the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and the Antimatter Legion? Why would they blame the victim?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 131.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Dan Shu's rebellion and Phantylia's scheming are merely one side of the story to the other Arbiter-Generals of the Alliance. Only a single piece of incontrovertible evidence remains, creating an endless source of potential complications.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 176.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The Ambrosial Arbor.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 132.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Yes, it's undeniable that the plaguemark, which was subdued by the Xianzhou Luofu, has resurfaced. But was it really a conspiracy instigated by the Antimatter Legion, or does it indicate a traitorous intent from within the Luofu, implicating Jing Yuan himself?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 133.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Once the spark of suspicion is kindled, it proves hard to extinguish.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We can vouch for Jing Yuan, though.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 134.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The general must have had that in mind when he invited us to attend the Wardance.
::No wonder we were called back for the ceremony.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No wonder we were called back for the ceremony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 156.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What was I thinking, seriously. Here I was looking forward to a carefree and enjoyable trip, but it seems wherever we go, drama is just around the corner.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 177.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Aww... I was so excited. I thought those Arbiter-Generals were just here to see the ceremony...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 178.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' By the way, I heard that an alchemist from the Zhuming diplomatic ship has arrived, and rumors say that she's to be the new Cauldron Master of the Alchemy Commission on the Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 135.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' An alchemist from the Zhuming serving as the Cauldron Master on the Luofu? While it's not unheard of, the timing itself...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 179.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Thanks to your words, Mr. Dan Heng, now I finally see the underlying tensions.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 180.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The general is under tremendous pressure right now, but I was completely oblivious to his troubles... How naive of me!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 157.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Come on! Don't think like that! Leave the adult matters to the adults. Even if you wanted to do something for the general, it's not like you can do anything.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 181.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 158.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh, did I say something wrong again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're a real master of conversation!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please, March, just keep quiet.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 182.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Miss March is right. I don't have the skills to share the general's burdens at the moment.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 183.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...Still, I'll do my best to follow his instructions. Let's go. Once I've taken you to your accommodations, I need to go to the Artisanship Commission to handle the IPC's protest.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 159.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' He looks like he has a lot on his mind. We can't just let him go alone... Why don't we accompany you to the Artisanship Commission?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 184.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' This... is too much trouble. While I appreciate your kindness, dealing with the IPC workers could be tricky... I'm afraid this will cause trouble for the Express...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 160 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 160 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No worries! We're pretty experienced in dealing with the IPC! You've heard of the Ten Stonehearts, right? We've dealt with quite a few of them, right, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Brag all you want, but don't drag me into this.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 161.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, who's bragging? Anyway, this time it's just a few ordinary IPC workers. Surely you don't think they'll be even trickier than Aventurine, do you?
::You're a real master of conversation!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 162.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, exactly... Uhm, are you being sarcastic?
::Stop, stop! I don't want to end up in an IPC lawsuit.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're a real master of conversation!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 162.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, exactly... Uhm, are you being sarcastic?
::Stop, stop! I don't want to end up in an IPC lawsuit.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stop, stop! I don't want to end up in an IPC lawsuit.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 163.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What's with you turning into a scaredy-cat? I didn't see you worrying about lawsuits when you wrecked that giant mech.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 185.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Well, since you're willing to help, I won't decline your kindness. Let's head to the Artisanship Commission and meet them.
