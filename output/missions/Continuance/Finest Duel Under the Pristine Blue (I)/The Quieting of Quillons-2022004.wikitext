:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 128.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' All these years, and the view at the Alchemy Commission hasn't changed a bit.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 129.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' The tides come and go, but the ancient sea remains the same. For us Vidyadhara, there's nothing more nostalgic than our homeland.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 139.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...You're a Luofu native, Miss Lingsha?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 130.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Yes, I grew up here, listening to the sound of waves while researching prescriptions with my mentors and peers at the Alchemy Commission.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 131.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' It's kind of sad, isn't it? Everything changes but somehow remains familiar. Just like you, Dan Heng, I traveled far from home, and now I've returned. Seeing the familiar scenery brings back a hint of nostalgia.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 215.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The view here would be even better without the Ambrosial Arbor.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 132.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Oh, really? I think that towering tree looks pretty impressive.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 216.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Even if it's impressive, it's a plaguemark. The Xianzhou have been fighting abominations for thousands of years, and now that the Ambrosial Arbor has been reborn, it's only natural for everyone to feel uneasy.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 133.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Well, once a seed is planted, no matter how long it takes, it'll eventually sprout and bear fruit.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 134.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' In my humble opinion, the rebirth of the Ambrosial Arbor and the resurgence of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus were inevitable. The seed was already planted when the ancestors of the Xianzhou sought immortality.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why such a serious topic all of a sudden...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We can't just make wild speculations about these things, Miss Lingsha.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought we were here to have some tea, but where's the tea?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 135.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' My bad. Well, since you went through the entire Ambrosial Arbor Crisis firsthand, Dan Heng and Lieutenant Yanqing, I'd like to discuss something with you.
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 132.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Why do I keep bumping into you? Are you stalking me or something?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 221.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Of course not. Unlike you, Miss Yunli, I have important things to take care of. You, on the other hand, seem to have all the time in the world to wander around without returning my sword.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 133.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Grandpa used to say that a sword reflects its master. I talked to your sword, and it told me that you've been distracted. You hesitate when you should strike, and you struggle to stay calm when your sword is unsheathed...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 134.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Now that I see you again, I realize your sword was right. It wasn't me who took your sword. It was you who lost focus.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 222.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Do you really expect me to believe that nonsense? I've been taking it easy on you because you're a guest from the Zhuming, but you're not taking the hint. Don't people from the Zhuming know you're supposed to return what you've borrowed?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 135.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Just look at this flying sword. Even if I give it back to you now, it'll just be taken away again in a few hours.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 136.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You know the Cloud Knight saying: "A Cloud Knight must never let slip their weapon," yes? Well, sure, I can give it back to you now, but on the battlefield, that's a whole different story. Poor flying sword.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 223.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Fine, you don't have to give it back because I'll take it back myself!!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe I should call the general...
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 player 131 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 player 131 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' But which general should I call?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 171.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Between these two, who do you think is tougher? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
::Oh, to be young and at the whim of impulse.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 172.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Between these two, who do you think is tougher? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 142.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Get ready to separate them.
::So, is this the Wardance?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, to be young and at the whim of impulse.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 172.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Between these two, who do you think is tougher? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 142.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Get ready to separate them.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, is this the Wardance?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 173.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Between these two, who do you think is tougher, Dan Heng? Don't get me wrong, I'm just curious.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 143.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Get ready to separate them.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 151.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' It is my first day at the Alchemy Commission &mdash; a brawl is definitely not how I imagined celebrating it.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 137.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Well, since you don't approve, I won't draw my sword here.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 152.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' I didn't mean it that way. Since you've already drawn your swords, you'd be disappointed if you didn't get to test one another, right?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 153.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' I've received reports that the delves near the Alchemy Commission are still infested with abominations. Seems like my predecessors left quite a mess. So, if you two want to determine who's better, why not focus on them instead of each other?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 138.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Clearing out some abominations? Meh, sounds boring.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 224.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' It's the Cloud Knights' duty to eliminate those abominations. You don't have to ask me twice, Miss Lingsha. I'll help you get rid of them.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 139.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Oh, you think you're the only one who knows how to behave? If Lingsha needs anything, I'll gladly draw my sword and help her out.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 lingsha 154.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' It's so heartwarming to see both of you being so sweet and caring. So then, shall we get going?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go!
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Wait a second!

;(Talk to Patient)
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 crowdF 103.ogg}} '''Angry Patient:''' Do you have any idea how many years I've waited just to see the Healer Lady? And now someone cuts in line? How is that fair?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yizhu 103.ogg}} '''Resigned Medic:''' Please calm down... That person is an esteemed guest who has traveled from afar. She simply couldn't wait in line for years, so we had to let her see the Healer Lady before you.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yizhu 104.ogg}} '''Resigned Medic:''' But don't worry. As soon as she's done, it'll be your turn. By the way, the esteemed guest said she'll cover your medical expenses as compensation.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 crowdF 104.ogg}} '''Angry Patient:''' Well... I guess that's acceptable. Your "esteemed guest" seems reasonable, so I'll just pretend nothing happened.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yizhu 105.ogg}} '''Resigned Medic:''' Thanks for understanding. Please have a rest over here.
