:{{DIcon|undefined}} Investigate
:{{tx}}
:'''System:''' You have an interstellar message. Please check it promptly.
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well, things are getting lively. We've barely recovered from The Family's Charmony Festival, and we're already being invited to another special event.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Trailblazing is all about having fun.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why not think about it this way. Our trailblazing expeditions are turning into "blast expeditions," where we eat, drink, and play wherever we go.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 pompom 103.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Blast... expedition?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, wherever we go, we eat, play, and have a blast!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm still recovering from the trauma caused by the last "festivity."
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, me too!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But wait, won't it look unprofessional if we attend two ceremonies in a row? Aren't we supposed to be focused on restoring astral charts and doing some serious scientific exploration?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So, we should leave March behind to take care of the Express?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' H-hey! That's not what I meant! I'm all for some fun... I just hope there won't be any surprise party crashers like Friday or Saturday.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 101.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Xianzhou Luofu has recently overcome a crisis. By holding the Wardance, they're demonstrating to everyone that they've returned to a state of peace and safety.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But that's what everyone said before we went to Penacony! "You'll be totally safe under The Family's protection!"
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' No need to worry. The Wardance is not like the Charmony Festival with all its hidden secrets. It's just a festival to honor the Reignbow Arbiter and the Cloud Knights who fought against the Abominations of Abundance and protected the Xianzhou ships.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Aside from starskiff performances, it's mostly martial contests, nothing too different from the Taikiyan Roboball contest we've seen before.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' What do you think, Himeko? Since we've accepted Miss Black Swan's proposal, we should probably head to Amphoreus for refueling.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Mm, there's certainly no rush. This trailblazing expedition is quite unique, and the Express needs to be fully stocked and prepared before moving on to the next stop.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' With Madam Herta's help, I was planning to deliver some Leviathan fossils from Calenga Abyss to Ruan Mei, member #81 of the Genius Society. It could earn us some favors before we set off. However, it may take a few weeks.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ah, so that means... we're not going to the Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Being an adult means maintaining relationships, whether we like it or not, March. Since we've been invited, it's only right for the Astral Express to attend the ceremony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 106 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' So, here's the plan: Pom-Pom will take everyone to the Xianzhou Luofu. Mr. Yang and I will meet up with Ruan Mei and fulfill our promise. Meanwhile, (Trailblazer), March, and Dan Heng will represent the Express and attend the Wardance.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 103 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 103 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' What do you two think, (Trailblazer) and Dan Heng?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds great. Let's split into groups!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I don't hear any objections.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to play with Leviathan fossils, too!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Himeko and Mr. Yang will be busy with serious research. Besides, fossils can't compete with martial contests when it comes to fun, right?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Plus, you're the only one with so many friends on the Luofu. I'll be lost if you don't come along! You've got to lead the way.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 pompom 104.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' Now that everyone's on board with the plan, it's time to warp to the Xianzhou Luofu.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Calenga Abyss... what does she expect to find there? Current research on Leviathan merely proves how little we know about such life forms...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 107.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That's why geniuses are interested in that field. Science is all about uncovering the unknown...
:The conversation between the two adults brims with complex jargon, from "Assumptive Astrobiological Chemistry" to "Trans-dimensional Evolutionary Theory," filling the carriage with an air of dense perplexity.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have a safe trip, you two.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come back soon.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 108 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 himeko 108 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Don't miss us too much, (Trailblazer). If I stumble upon some cool Leviathan fossils, I'll bring a few back as souvenirs for you.
