:At the same time, (Trailblazer), Dan Heng, and Hanya realize that the situation in the prison is out of control...
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiB 101.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' Madam Hanya, the wardens in all areas are regrouping. Those ingenium enemies are wandering around and causing heavy casualties.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiB 102.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' And to make things worse, those iron wolves broke open the cages and let the criminals out! We've called for backup, but it seems like all communication is jammed.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 150.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. By decree of the Ten Lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiC 101.ogg}} '''Aurumaton Spectral Envoy:''' Just a short time ago, the Nether Key mechanism was activated. It was probably Madam Xueyi and the Yaoqing messengers, heading to the bottom of the prison. Given the situation, I'm afraid that area is exactly where our enemies are targeting.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 151.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' We mustn't let that vile beast escape from its cage!
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiC 102.ogg}} '''Aurumaton Spectral Envoy:''' We've gathered all the prison guards who can still fight, and we'll split up and secure each floor.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 152.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Go!
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 danheng 131.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Those intruders are quite bold. They must have been planning this for quite a while.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 153.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. Crafting careful and precise plans like this... is simply not their style.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 154.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Let's focus on the current situation right now. Please help me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like the testimony will have to wait, huh?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like I said, wherever we go, we always end up in trouble.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 danheng 132.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What's the fastest way to the bottom of this prison, Miss Hanya? If we don't get there quickly, we'll soon be outnumbered by all the enemies inside.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 155.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' We'll have to bend the rules. Please follow me.

:Large pieces of metal scraps are strewn all over the floor. You can't put your finger on it, but you're certain that this thing is still alive. Bionic tissues are relentlessly regenerating beneath their exoskeleton.

:The "fugitive wearing a dark cloak," spoken of by Hanya, now stands before you. His face is devoid of any expression, cold and indifferent, yet... inexplicably, you could decipher this expressionless facade as if it whispered, "You're finally here."

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 moze 129.ogg}} '''Moze:''' Hopefully, someone will eventually notice that something is off and come to help. As for whether we'll still be alive by then, it's not something we should think about.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are we really out of options?
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 194.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' None of you are part of the Ten-Lords Commission, so sacrificing yourselves isn't the right move. As a judge, it's my responsibility to guard this prison, and if someone should step up to stop Hoolay from escaping, it should be me, not you.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:This warden fought to her death, and her weapon's nowhere to be seen. She must have lost it somewhere in the prison.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:The corpse in a Cloud Knight's armor catches your attention. They do not seem to be your average foxian, for one. This body looks like it underwent a drastic shapeshifting, one that failed to conceal the guard hairs around their neck.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:This aurumaton spectral envoy appears to have been smashed to smithereens with only a single strike. Hoolay likely slammed his arm in to deliver this shockingly destructive force.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:These are the remains of a borisin. Judging from their twisted limbs, it is likely that this massive wolf once had their limbs restrained.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:Whoever impaled this borisin from behind probably caught them off guard. It could be a judge or a Yaoqing messenger.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:In the suffocating, empty darkness, an air of deathly stillness lingered about the gates of the cage that once confined Hoolay, chilling all who gaze upon it to the marrow.
:The cage should have been virtually impossible to break out of, yet even it had failed to trap the savage beast for long.
