:At the same time, (Trailblazer), Dan Heng, and Hanya realize that the situation in the prison is out of control...
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiB 101.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' Madam Hanya, the wardens in all areas are regrouping. Those ingenium enemies are wandering around and causing heavy casualties.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiB 102.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' And to make things worse, those iron wolves broke open the cages and let the criminals out! We've called for backup, but it seems like all communication is jammed.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 150.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Let's preserve our strength and first take down the isolated prisoners. By decree of the Ten Lords, all prison breakers and intruders shall be apprehended, dead or alive.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiC 101.ogg}} '''Aurumaton Spectral Envoy:''' Just a short time ago, the Nether Key mechanism was activated. It was probably Madam Xueyi and the Yaoqing messengers, heading to the bottom of the prison. Given the situation, I'm afraid that area is exactly where our enemies are targeting.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 151.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' We mustn't let that vile beast escape from its cage!
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 shiwangsiC 102.ogg}} '''Aurumaton Spectral Envoy:''' We've gathered all the prison guards who can still fight, and we'll split up and secure each floor.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 153.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Indeed, but borisin tend to favor direct and aggressive approaches. Crafting careful and precise plans like this... is simply not their style.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 154.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Let's focus on the current situation right now. Please help me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like the testimony will have to wait, huh?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like I said, wherever we go, we always end up in trouble.
::Like I said, wherever we go, we always end up in trouble.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:This warden fought to her death, and her weapon's nowhere to be seen. She must have lost it somewhere in the prison.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:The corpse in a Cloud Knight's armor catches your attention. They do not seem to be your average foxian, for one. This body looks like it underwent a drastic shapeshifting, one that failed to conceal the guard hairs around their neck.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:This aurumaton spectral envoy appears to have been smashed to smithereens with only a single strike. Hoolay likely slammed his arm in to deliver this shockingly destructive force.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:These are the remains of a borisin. Judging from their twisted limbs, it is likely that this massive wolf once had their limbs restrained.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:Whoever impaled this borisin from behind probably caught them off guard. It could be a judge or a Yaoqing messenger.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:In the suffocating, empty darkness, an air of deathly stillness lingered about the gates of the cage that once confined Hoolay, chilling all who gaze upon it to the marrow.
:The cage should have been virtually impossible to break out of, yet even it had failed to trap the savage beast for long.
