:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 174.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, was that the Yaoqing General who just dropped in out of nowhere? She's so awesome!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 175.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I mean, when Yunli swung that massive sword, she just casually blocked her attack with ease...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 237.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...And mine, too.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 176.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ahem, yeah... But to go up against Yunli is quite impressive, you know? That aura of heroism and grace. It almost makes me want to learn Xianzhou swordplay!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 177 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 177 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You think so too, right, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yep, those moves were fabulous!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 144.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I agree. General Feixiao is indeed impressive.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 player 132 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 player 132 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Uh... I was talking about Yanqing, actually.
::Hmmm, that general is totally something else...
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 145.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I agree. General Feixiao is indeed impressive.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 178.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I was actually hoping you'd give Yanqing some praise!
::Oh, yeah, Xianzhou swordplay is really good! Like really, really good!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmmm, that general is totally something else...
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 145.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I agree. General Feixiao is indeed impressive.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 178.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I was actually hoping you'd give Yanqing some praise!
::Oh, yeah, Xianzhou swordplay is really good! Like really, really good!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, yeah, Xianzhou swordplay is really good! Like really, really good!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 179.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Can't you put a little more enthusiasm into it?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 238.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Thanks for the kind words, Miss March. The Wardance is coming up, and I've been chosen to represent the Cloud Knights in the ceremony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 239.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I've had my fair share of defeats lately, and even though I know there are always more skilled swordmasters out there, seeing General Feixiao's skills today has made me feel a bit uneasy again.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 146.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Don't underestimate yourself. After all, generals won't fight in the ring during the Wardance. Just remember the state of mind you had when you single-handedly took on me and Blade, putting life and death aside. With that mindset, you can prevail against most challengers.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 240.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I see. Thanks for the advice, Master Dan Heng! By the way, now that today's events are over, General Jing Yuan wants to invite all of you to the Seat of Divine Foresight. He has something important to discuss.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Something important?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 180.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I bet it's about how to deal with the generals from the Yaoqing and the Zhuming.

:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 137.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The Marshal ordered me to come to the Xianzhou Luofu, but the document only says: "Attend the Wardance and listen to Feixiao's questioning."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What does that mean?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 138.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The Marshal is well aware of Jing Yuan's purpose in holding the ceremony and understands the situation he is facing. She mentioned it because she believes both issues are important.
::Since it's the Marshal's orders, do we need to step aside?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Since it's the Marshal's orders, do we need to step aside?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 139.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' No need for that. You're all important witnesses. The Marshal is well aware of Jing Yuan's purpose in holding the ceremony and understands the situation he is facing. She mentioned it because she believes both issues are important.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 126.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Thanks for your kindness and sincerity, Elder Huaiyan, but is it appropriate... to tell everyone here about the Marshal's orders?

:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 144.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' There will be numerous contests and celebrations during the Wardance, and the main event will be the Ringmaster's Challenge.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 145.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The host will dispatch a skilled warrior to take on challengers from all over the cosmos, showcasing the excellent martial arts of the Xianzhou Luofu. When you mentioned that the Astral Express would be attending the ceremony, I thought the high elder of the Luofu would be the ringmaster...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 127.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' You humor me, Elder Huaiyan. The Healer Lady is just a young lady who knows nothing about martial arts. How can I assign her as the ringmaster?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 146.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' I'm no match to you when it comes to joking.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 182.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What's this box for? Why don't you open it, General Huaiyan?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 147.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' This sword case is intended for the Wardance's award. It's empty now, but in a few days, a precious sword will be delivered and stored inside.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 148.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' I don't mean to boast about our skills, but this sword represents the pinnacle of the Zhuming's craftsmanship. It has a legendary history, full of heroic tales from foreign lands, tales that are too detailed to be summarized in just a few words. Since the delegation delivering the sword hasn't arrived yet, I'll just leave the case here for now.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 149.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' I've been wondering... who would be worthy of such a sword? And then it hit me &mdash; I can award it to the champion of the Ringmaster's Challenge! The ceremony's champion is sure to be a perfect match for the sword.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 150.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Moreover, I hear that Yanqing is an excellent swordmaster, and that he will be representing the Luofu as the ringmaster, so it seems like a perfect gift for him.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 128.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Thank you for your generosity, Elder Huaiyan.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 153.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' If you want to give me a sword, just say the word, Grandpa. No need to beat around the bush.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 151.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' You've got confidence, my girl, but I don't think you can best Yanqing.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 242.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I know you're all about swords, Miss Yunli. It's just a shame that it's the sword that ultimately chooses its rightful master.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 154.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Yeah, and even if someone gets their hands on such a precious sword, it'll probably end up in someone else's.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 243.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The outcome of our duel at the Alchemy Commission is still up in the air. Since you're interested, why don't you represent the Xianzhou Zhuming and challenge me in the ring?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 155.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That's exactly what I had in mind! Nobody knows who's gonna come out on top! It could be me, could be someone else... It'll probably be me, but whatever happens... it won't be him!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like Feixiao was right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It'll be either death or disaster when these two clash...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 183.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Not to be rude or anything... We've been watching their drama. I'm dying to find out who beats who.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 152.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Quiet down! We have other guests here! I've prepared this sword to add some excitement to the ceremony, not to have you two squabble. It's not a good look for the Alliance.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 153.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' While you both seem confident that you'll win, you need to remember there can only be one winner and one loser in the ring, which could lead to hard feelings. Actually, I have an idea...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 154.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' We don't know who the winner will be, and it might not be either of you, but if you're eyeing that prize, you'll need to work together. I want you to take on an apprentice who will take part in the Wardance and win at least one match.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 156.ogg}} '''Yunli & Yanqing:''' How does that make sense?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 155.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' In my humble opinion, while a Cloud Knight is commendable by securing victories, it's even more so to pass on your skills and spread the way of swordplay.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 156.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' I'd be greatly pleased if this apprentice could represent the Express in the Wardance by displaying their Cloud Knight flair and prowess.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 129.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Well, Elder Huaiyan's idea is quite interesting. Imparting swordplay skills requires teamwork, and both the winner and the loser will learn a valuable lesson regardless of the outcome. The question is, whom should the two of them take as an apprentice?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 184.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? Who? Wait, me...?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 157.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' I noticed just now that Miss March seemed quite interested in the outcome of your sword fight, so I thought why not teach her the art of swordplay?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 185.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Huh? Wait! Are you serious, General?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 186.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why am I being dragged into this all of a sudden? I've never practiced swordplay before! I'm a total newbie! You really think I can learn it? You'll probably realize I have no hope and give up on me, and that'd be sooo embarrassing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you choose Dan Heng?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 148 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 148 f.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Things are already complicated enough as they are, (Trailblazer).
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 158.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' He strikes like lightning... Does Mr. Dan Heng really need anyone's guidance?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 159.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' As for Miss March... she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
::Why don't you choose me?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 160.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Your talent is quite... unique. Are you also interested in swordplay?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 161.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' But you know, based on my years of judging people, you don't really need to dive into swordplay to boost your skills... and I doubt there's anyone out there who can really show you the way forward.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 162.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' As for Miss March... she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
::Just accept your fate, March!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you choose me?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 160.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Your talent is quite... unique. Are you also interested in swordplay?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 161.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' But you know, based on my years of judging people, you don't really need to dive into swordplay to boost your skills... and I doubt there's anyone out there who can really show you the way forward.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 162.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' As for Miss March... she's like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped.
::Just accept your fate, March!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just accept your fate, March!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 player 133 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 player 133 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Isn't this a perfect chance for you? I remember you mentioning that you wanted to learn some sword moves.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 187.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, I did say that, but this is all happening so quickly, don't you think?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 163.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Miss March is like a piece of jade in the rough, just waiting to be shaped. The Wardance is the perfect opportunity to see what heights she can reach.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 188.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I appreciate your kind words, General Huaiyan. But won't teaching me swordplay be a waste of Yanqing and Yunli's time? They should be preparing for the ceremony.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 189.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Plus, I heard that each swordmaster has their own special moves. What if they let something slip while teaching me? If everyone knows each other's tactics, won't that mean everyone is stuck in a stalemate and unable to end their fights during the Wardance?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 157.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That's considerate of you, March 7th. But don't worry. It'll take you at least a decade of hard training before you can even start learning special moves. No need to freak out – a few Zhuming swordplay tricks will mean you'll be more than equipped.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 190.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' R&mdash;really?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 149.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Looks like March's curiosity has been piqued.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 huaiyan 164.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Heh, the whole point is to know each other's moves. Defeating your opponent in just one move? How boring would that be! Plus, what really decides a swordsman's fate isn't some "special move" &mdash; it's the solid fundamentals.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 130.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' So, Miss Yunli has already agreed. What do you say, Yanqing?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 245.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' General... I haven't graduated yet. How can I be qualified to teach swordplay to others?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yunli 158.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' So, you're admitting your defeat, huh? If you're not even confident to teach, why don't you let me be the ringmaster instead?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 131.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Yanqing, teaching an apprentice is also a way of honing your own skills and gaining insights. You've been an apprentice for years, it's about time you looked at swordplay from another perspective.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 246.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I see, General. Then count me in!
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 jingyuan 132.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Now that Yanqing has agreed too, it all comes down to Miss March giving her nod.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 150.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' It's up to you to make the final decision, March.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Time for you to become the best swordmaster on the Express.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 player 134 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 player 134 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' At least that way, I won't have to worry about you accidentally shooting me in the butt all the time.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 191.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, I've never missed my target!
::It won't be a walk in the park, that's for sure.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 192.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, while I'm smart, learning swordplay sounds like a whole lot of work.
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 player 135 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 9 player 135 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' It'll be great learning swordplay. That way, I won't have to worry about you accidentally shooting me in the butt all the time.
