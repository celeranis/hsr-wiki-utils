:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 112.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' But with your skills, I don't think you need to worry about that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, are there really eighteen floors here?
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 113 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 113 f.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' You're funny, (Trailblazer). This prison does contain many layers. We even brought in Vidyadhara Ichor Line craftsmen to introduce the ingenuity of delve enchantment. What you're seeing now is just one part of The Shackling Prison.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that true, Dan Heng?
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 danheng 122.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Perhaps. Judging from the appearance, much of the architecture in this prison has a Vidyadharan style... So perhaps they did have a hand in building this place back then.
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 114.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' As for how many floors there are...? Well, not even us judges know for sure.
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 115.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' But there's a legend among us judges that a short-life prisoner once tried to escape but ended up falling into the depths... and when we found him at the bottom, he was already an old man on the brink of death...
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 116.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Did he spend his whole life falling? Or did some long-life prisoner drain his life essence? We'll never know. Anyway, please don't try anything like that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why keep the terrain so dangerous?
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 117 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 117 f.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' You're funny, (Trailblazer). This prison does contain many layers. We even brought in Vidyadhara Ichor Line craftsmen to introduce the ingenuity of delve enchantment. What you're seeing now is just one part of The Shackling Prison.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that true, Dan Heng?
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 danheng 123.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Perhaps. Judging from the appearance, much of the architecture in this prison has a Vidyadharan style... So perhaps they did have a hand in building this place back then.
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 118.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Well, the paths here serve as both passageways for the Ten-Lords Commission and barriers for the prisoners.
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 119.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Most prisoners locked up here have committed serious crimes violating the Xianzhou Legal Code, and many of them are Denizens of Abundance like borisin, houyhnhnm, and {{Rubi|wingweavers|featherines}}. To be honest, these abominations... are pretty good at trying to break out.
::{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 120.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' So, as long as the treacherous terrain here makes it harder for them to escape, the Ten-Lords Commission doesn't have any complaints.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 121.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Please come this way.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 124.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' I heard the Wardance is about to be held in the mortal world. I remember watching a sword duel at the Wardance with my sister when we were young.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 125.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' The Cloud Knight who was the Luofu's ringmaster was an amazing swordsman, and their sword flashed like lightning. The outworld challenger had fiery red hair and a hand made of steel which roared like thunder. They battled for a long time before a winner could be declared.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 hanya 126.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Time sure flies. Now, both my sister and I are residents of the netherworld, and we will never again feel the thrill of a competition.
