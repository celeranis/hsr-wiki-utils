:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Definitely unusual!
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I agree.

:The Cloud Knights calm the crowd, then dispersed, and the street was restored to its peaceful state.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 137.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You look much maturer now, Yanqing.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 139.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Please don't tease me, Miss March. The situation on the Xianzhou before the Wardance is like a calm lake that can be disturbed by even the smallest pebble &mdash; capable of generating far-reaching ripples with even the slightest disturbance.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 138.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What are those people... I mean, those "monsters" we just dealt with?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know! They're Kobolds, right?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 140.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Those werewolf monsters are known as "borisin." They are Abominations of Abundance, and we've been fighting them for a very long time.
::Did you call them "the borisin"?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you call them "the borisin"?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 141.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Yeah, those werewolf monsters are known as "borisin." They are Abominations of Abundance, and we've been fighting them for a very long time.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 142.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The borisin have been a powerful force for a long time, plundering and enslaving many worlds. The threat they pose is just as terrible as the Swarm Disaster, and the Alliance even had a fierce war with them three decades ago.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 143.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Their presence has faded over the years, but who would have thought...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 danheng 118.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' According to that officer, they attacked an IPC ship near the Xianzhou Luofu. Such a brazen attack seems quite unusual to me.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 144.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Yeah, that's what I find strange, too. It seems like the IPC and the borisin have some serious grudges.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 145.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Well, enough with the chitchat. The general wants me to take you to the Palace of Astrum.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 146.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I'd love to chichat a little longer, but there are some things that can't be left unchecked...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 139.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmm? Is it a serious matter? Maybe you'll... need our help in hunting down the borisin?
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 147.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Thank you, but it's no big deal.
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 148.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' By the way... that young lady who just appeared... she took my sword. I'm thinking of filing a lost property report at the Realm-Keeping Commission to see if I can get it back...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 140.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hahaha, I doubt she did it on purpose!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So when Cloud Knights get into trouble, they have to call the emergency services too?
::{{A|VO chapter2 9 mar7th 141.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Perhaps she's around here somewhere? Shouldn't we take a look?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You go file the report, and I go fetch the popcorn. It's gonna be quite the show...
:{{A|VO chapter2 9 yanqing 149.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Don't remind me. I just zoned out for a moment, that's all.
