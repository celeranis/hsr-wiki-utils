:{{A|VO chapter2 10 feixiao 144.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' First, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus grew uninterrupted on the Luofu, yet the Six Charioteers were not aware of it. That was a dereliction of duty.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 jingyuan 106.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' And as for the Wardance... Do you think I'm unaware of the risks? However, risks can also be opportunities. The Luofu has lain low for too long. I believe it's time to stir up the dregs hidden in the depths and wash them away once and for all.
