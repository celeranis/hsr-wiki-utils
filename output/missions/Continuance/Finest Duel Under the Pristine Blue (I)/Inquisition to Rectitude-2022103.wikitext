:{{A|VO chapter2 10 feixiao 144.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' First, the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus grew uninterrupted on the Luofu, yet the Six Charioteers were not aware of it. That was a dereliction of duty.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 jingyuan 105.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' As for the Stellaron Hunters' prophecy, I didn't believe all of it, but in the end, the Luofu did survive the Ambrosial Arbor crisis. So, I think it's safe to say that Elio's prophecy about the future holds some merit.
:{{A|VO chapter2 10 jingyuan 106.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' And as for the Wardance... Do you think I'm unaware of the risks? However, risks can also be opportunities. The Luofu has lain low for too long. I believe it's time to stir up the dregs hidden in the depths and wash them away once and for all.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 feixiao 153.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' The scouts of the Verdant Knights have sent back reports that borisin are making trouble again.

:{{A|VO chapter2 10 feixiao 158.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' General Jing Yuan, you already know what has to be done, but since you don't want to be the bad guy, I'll take care of it for you. You need the final word from the Ten-Lords Commission to quell any doubts.
