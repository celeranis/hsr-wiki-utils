:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 213.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I don't think searching like this is the best way...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 213.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' "Diner haunted! Evil spirit breaks into restaurant and eats double its body weight in food!" ...Do you think Tail did this? Seems like his style...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 183.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Sounds like a very hungry criminal came up with a very poor excuse...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 214.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' What about this one... "Paranormal activity reported at exclusive horror immersia! Guests experience haunting within seven days of screening!"
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 215.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' It reminds me of when I used to watch horror immersia to train my courage... whenever there was a suspenseful moment, Tail would jump up and scare me.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 184.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Guys, I feel like this is just some sort of prank... or a marketing stunt to boost ticket sales.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you guys up to?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have we planned out our next steps yet?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 185.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Huohuo has been browsing Ghostly Grove for hours. Every time she finds a suspicious incident, she says: "Do you think Tail did this?"
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 186.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' The problem is, any suspicious incident could be Tail-related when you think about it...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 216.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' I feel like Tail is still around... but if so, why didn't he come back to see me?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He'll come back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, he is a heliobus...
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 214.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' That's right &mdash; we can't really know what a heliobus is thinking, right? Tail was sealed away for ages and then suddenly let free... If it were me, I'd want some away time.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 215.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' You'll just have to be a little patient.

;(Talk to Huohuo)
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 220.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Hey! Look at this!
