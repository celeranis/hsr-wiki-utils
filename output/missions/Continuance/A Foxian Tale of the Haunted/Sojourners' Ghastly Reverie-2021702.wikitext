===Find the exit of the Illusory Maze{{subst:void|<!--202170201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|You often see similar news stories about a person getting lost while trying to find another missing person. Unfortunately, today's the day you are destined to be the protagonist of such a story. Gradually, you manage to lose track of even Huohuo. After sizing up a strange bronze mirror for a moment, you are somehow pulled into a realm of illusion. There's walls and doors everywhere, sending you round in circles and disorienting you.<br />According to some of the Xianzhou folk tales you've heard, the outside world will have passed hundreds of years by the time you leave here &mdash; you don't want to spend the rest of your life lost in a maze, so find the exit pronto!}}

===Search out clues from supernatural stories{{subst:void|<!--202170206-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|update|Through Cirrus' guidance, you discover a ripped page from a bizarre story recounting events surrounding the heliobi and the Luofu's general from centuries ago. Its writing style seems to hint at a way to see through the illusory maze.}}

===Meet up with Huohuo{{subst:void|<!--202170209-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|update|Cirrus seems unreliable, but following its instructions ultimately leads to Huohuo.<br />Well, if even a Judge would be stuck in an illusion just like you did, then the garden must... No, you decide you don't want to think through whatever's happening in Fyxestroll Garden. Because without any doubt, it will be irredeemably dreadful.}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|update|Sticking close to you, Cirrus chatters garrulously about the Xianzhou's old grudge against the heliobi while also stealing use of your mouth to sow seeds of discontent among this small, lost team. It'll take everyone working together to get out of this maze. Comfort Huohuo, then find a way out of here together.}}

===Investigate the strange bronze mirror{{subst:void|<!--202170214-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|update|Similar to when you came in, there's a bronze mirror emitting a strange sound. Perhaps it's a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission coming to rescue you; perhaps it's heliobi toying with you like a cornered animal.<br />On the upside, not even monsters can hurt you through a mirror, right? Let's go check it out.}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Furynox|update|Xueyi's voice comes from the mirror, but it's hard to tell whether these voices are real. Perhaps only someone involved like Huohuo could possibly clarify the truth.}}
