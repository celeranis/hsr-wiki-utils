{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Aurum Alley|No matter what kind of science-, magic-, faith-, or whatever-based upbringing you've had, when a third-tier influencer sends you a spam message claiming to have encountered supernatural entities in a deserted garden, your reaction would be: 1.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't think so...
::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 134.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Then allow me! As a streamer, I've done my fair share of research. Let me find my script...
::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 135.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' "Wandering Fox Spirits and Ghostly Tails..." Fyxestroll Garden was originally a garden delve constructed by a foxian craftmaster. It was a place for their kin to rest, write poems, and feast... et cetera et cetera.
::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 136.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' It's said the elite pilots of the foxians were almost wiped out in the Denizens of Abundance Wars thirty years ago. People went to the Foxsomn Tomb in Fyxestroll Garden to grieve for the departed... Because of this, Fyxestroll Garden rarely saw visitors and was bereft of joy.
::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 137.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Over time, Fyxestroll Garden became full of flickering ghostly flames, and weeping lamentations echoed through the air. The rumor that the garden was haunted spread like wildfire among Xianzhou Luofu residents.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like the hauntings in Fyxestroll Garden could be true after all?
:::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 138.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I know, right? I did a lot of research before I decided to film here...
:::...Aaaand who wrote that for you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Aaaand who wrote that for you?
::{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 139.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Ugh, man, is it that obvious? I paid Mr. Xiyan to write it up for me. Sounded a little too professional, huh?
::Could you make it quick?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could you make it quick?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 140.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Sure, I guess now's not really a good time for stories... Don't worry &mdash; I can sum it up in a single sentence.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 141.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Fyxestroll Garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen foxian fighters at the Foxsomn Tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 142.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I know it's easy to cast doubt, but the Ten-Lords Commission actually showed up this time.

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|You two &mdash; yes, only you two &mdash; arrive at the long-abandoned Fyxestroll Garden. The protagonists in most horror movies always like to brashly break into derelict buildings that are rumored to be haunted, completely disregarding all safety concerns and bringing in only a small party. If only they stopped to think things over, then none of the stories that follow would ever have happened.<br />On the way over, Guinaifen diligently recounts for you how Fyxestroll Garden ended up getting abandoned... all the while shooting plenty of spooky footage along the way. You can't help but feel it's actually quite hard for internet influencers to make a living, especially if they have to keep taking photos while resisting the urge to run away from such an ominous place, like a reporter at a homicide scene. This place really does feel as though it's haunted... Where, then, are the ghosts?}}

:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 124.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Why are the ghosts haunting the garden? A lingering grudge, perhaps... or maybe they're an omen of some impending disaster? Aren't you curious?

:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 132.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' It's so dark in here... It feels like we're being watched...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 133.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Did anyone ever tell you the scary stories about Fyxestroll Garden?
:Don't think so...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 134.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Then allow me! As a streamer, I've done my fair share of research. Let me find my script...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 135.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' "Wandering Fox Spirits and Ghostly Tails..." Fyxestroll Garden was originally a garden delve constructed by a foxian craftmaster. It was a place for their kin to rest, write poems, and feast... et cetera et cetera.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 136.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' It's said the elite pilots of the foxians were almost wiped out in the Denizens of Abundance Wars thirty years ago. People went to the Foxsomn Tomb in Fyxestroll Garden to grieve for the departed... Because of this, Fyxestroll Garden rarely saw visitors and was bereft of joy.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 137.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Over time, Fyxestroll Garden became full of flickering ghostly flames, and weeping lamentations echoed through the air. The rumor that the garden was haunted spread like wildfire among Xianzhou Luofu residents.
:Sounds like the hauntings in Fyxestroll Garden could be true after all?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 138.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I know, right? I did a lot of research before I decided to film here...
:...Aaaand who wrote that for you?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 139.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Ugh, man, is it that obvious? I paid Mr. Xiyan to write it up for me. Sounded a little too professional, huh?
:Could you make it quick?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 140.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Sure, I guess now's not really a good time for stories... Don't worry &mdash; I can sum it up in a single sentence.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 141.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Fyxestroll Garden used to be a garden delve, but people started coming here to mourn fallen foxian fighters at the Foxsomn Tomb, and rumors spread that the garden was haunted.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 142.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I know it's easy to cast doubt, but the Ten-Lords Commission actually showed up this time.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 143.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Speaking of which, we have to avoid running into the judges. If we get kicked out, it'll all be for nothing.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 144.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Anyway, that's the background. Let's keep moving, and watch your step...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 145.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Wait, wait, wait &mdash; stop.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 146.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' ...There are Ten-Lords Commission spiritfarers on patrol. Let's go the other way &mdash; we'll head to the Foxsomn Tomb first, then cut through the Locufox Forest.
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 151 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 151 f.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Wow, I didn't know you were so strong, bro! But these are Luofu officials... if we're interrogated, we need to get our story straight...
:We could say evil spirits possessed the spiritfarers...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 152.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Perfect! Let's just say it was self-defense. We had no choice.
:We could say that evil spirits possessed us...
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 153.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Makes sense. We went crazy and couldn't control ourselves... I like the way you think.
:Perhaps we were never here?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 154.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Whoa! Nice! There were no witnesses, so this never happened, alright?
:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 155.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' ...Let's keep going.
:{{A|VO side2 hh crowdG 101.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' Halt!
:{{A|VO side2 hh crowdG 102.ogg}} '''Wraith Warden:''' State your name and your business! Arrest them immediately!

:{{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 158 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 hh guinaifen 158 f.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' (Trailblazer), look how pale she is! And it seems like her eyes aren't even focusing... Is she a ghost?

A ghost is nothing compared to that.<br />The Judges patiently explain it in layman's terms to convince you and Guinaifen to return: There are no ghosts aboard the Xianzhou, just some extraterrestrial parasites that have escaped millennia of imprisonment. Don't wander around here for no reason, as it hinders us from carrying out our official duties.<br />Good news &mdash; There are no ghosts running around Fyxestroll Garden!
