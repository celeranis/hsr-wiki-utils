===Get information out of Cirrus{{subst:void|<!--801510403-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|Faced with the sudden incident, Madam Hanya goes through Huohuo's potential whereabouts with your group. You discover the seemingly "docile" Cirrus may hold a vital clue about Tail and has used it as bait to ensnare Huohuo.<br />While you are not entirely certain, confronting the cunning heliobus seems to be the best course of action.}}

===Head to Cloudford and find Huohuo{{subst:void|<!--801510404-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Cloudford|update|With surprising candor, Cirrus confesses to its deeds and reveals crucial information about Huohuo's whereabouts, even sparing you from a fight.<br />Although this raises suspicions, the top priority remains rescuing Huohuo.}}

===Enter Huohuo's hallucination with Tail{{subst:void|<!--801510406-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Cloudford|update|The heliobus has sealed Huohuo's five senses, rendering the "Harmonic Chime" ineffective. Thankfully, Tail appears at this time. "Using a heliobus to exorcise another heliobus" sure is a new way of exorcism.<br />It is time to let Mr. Tail break into the illusion.}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|Cirrus, having distracted the attention of everyone, gathered its power once again while the judges were absent from Fyxestroll Garden. Evidently, its plans failed once more.<br />Talk to Cirrus and find out what it is planning.}}

===Defeat Cirrus{{subst:void|<!--801510409-->}}===

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|With General Jing Yuan's assistance, you have protected Luofu from the hidden peril that few are aware of. The ghost-hunting squad contributed quite a lot to it. Ask Madam Hanya about her thoughts on this matter.}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|The only good heliobus is a captured heliobus. The only place they should go is the Suppression Towers in Fyxestroll Garden.<br />However, let's not forget that the heliobus possessing Huohuo's consciousness is still inside the Lunaumbra Gourd.}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|After successfully exorcising the heliobus in Huohuo, your next task is to publicize this victory on Ghostly Grove. However, you must minimize the public's perception of how dangerous the incident was to prevent panic, while also trying to stand out online to showcase the ghost-hunting squad's triumph. The task of writing a social media post is not any less challenging than exorcising the heliobus!}}
