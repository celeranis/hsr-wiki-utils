:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 145.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' It appears we are all present. The spiritfarers who were supposed to report to Huohuo mentioned they didn't see her today.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 146.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' I'll get straight to the point &mdash; I have no idea where Huohuo may be. However, if we combine our efforts we may be able to piece together some clues. Each of you are close to Huohuo, did you notice anything unusual about her yesterday?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She was concerned about her Tail.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 238.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, Miss Huohuo has been trying to track down Tail &mdash; in addition to helping the squad, that is.
::It seems like there's something weighing on her mind lately.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 239.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' She's been down in the dumps ever since she lost Tail.
::She thinks she's slowing us down.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It seems like there's something weighing on her mind lately.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 239.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' She's been down in the dumps ever since she lost Tail.
::She thinks she's slowing us down.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She thinks she's slowing us down.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 147.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Since becoming a judge, Huohuo has often thought about resigning. She thinks she might not be cut out for the task.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 108.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Captain Huohuo, should we start the ghost hunt now?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 148.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' If you ask me, after she lost Tail, I think her urge to resign became even more apparent.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 240.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' What if Huohuo came across a lead today &mdash; something that sounded like Tail's doing...? Knowing her, she's probably gone looking for him...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 149.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' ...And yet she didn't come to any of us for help. That's not like her.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 150.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Given the type of person she is, if she did have any clues, she would seek out our help. If she hasn't shared anything with us, it means there is only one possibility.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's been deceived?
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 241.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Correct. And I think I might know who the culprit is.
::Perhaps she doesn't trust us.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 151.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' After working together for the last few days, it is clear that Huohuo has already formed a close bond with each of you. It is hard for me to imagine she would simply wander off on her own... Unless someone deceived her...
::She must have some reason for acting alone...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps she doesn't trust us.

::She must have some reason for acting alone...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She must have some reason for acting alone...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 227.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Right, maybe someone deceived her with news about Tail &mdash; told her "she could only go alone." Sounds like a trick some nasty kidnapper would use.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 102.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' C&mdash;Captain? You can just call me Huohuo.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 152.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Cirrus... The only one who may have knowledge of Tail's whereabouts is Cirrus... whose plans were foiled due to Tail's actions.

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 188.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Well, well, insects who don't know when to quit. I sense you have questions... Go on, ask away.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 243.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Huohuo is missing, and I'm willing to bet you know something about it!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 189.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' How careless... Your companion vanishes right under your noses, and you fail to notice. Why am I the one you're pestering?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She left without a word &mdash; someone clearly deceived her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You lied to her about Tail's whereabouts.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 154.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' The Ten-Lords Commission might not be able to completely eradicate the heliobi, but we have plenty of ways of dealing with them...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 190.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Ooh, how threatening, hehe... Save your breath, I know your tactics.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 191.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Let's cut to the chase. I do know something about it.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 109.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' According to the Ten-Lords Commission's understanding of heliobi behavior, they tend to roam densely populated areas in search of hosts... and wherever they go, there are bound to be reports of "supernatural phenomena."
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 228.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' I knew it!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 192.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Believe it or not, while you were distracted, she came and found me. She asked me if I knew where "Mr. Tail" was, and I simply gave her a clue...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 193.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' She searched high and low, but came back empty-handed, of course. If only you could have seen her expression &mdash; simultaneously terrified and desperate to know more &mdash; utterly hilarious!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 194.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' In the end, I became fed up with her constant nagging. I told her that her beloved Tail had splintered and been reduced to an ember without a single memory... You should've seen her face!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't bully Huohuo!
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 195.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Aw, does it hurt? You'll be pleased to know I didn't drag out the suffering. I told her that her Tail was hiding in Cloudford &mdash; preparing to flee the Xianzhou on a starskiff.
::...Where is she!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Where is she!?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 196.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' I started feeling sorry for her. Out of pity I told her that her Tail was hiding in Cloudford &mdash; preparing to flee the Xianzhou on a starskiff.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 197.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' I also told her that the Ten-Lords Commission was in the process of recapturing all the heliobi. If she were to turn to you for help, "Mr. Tail" would be imprisoned &mdash; even if she managed to find him. Looks like she took the bait...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 155.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Lies! You can't possibly know where Tail disappeared to!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 110.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Little Gui, can you show us the website we'll be using for intel?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 198.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Maybe I do, maybe I don't. But I have no doubt about one thing: My friends are ready and waiting for her in Cloudford!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How could Huohuo be tricked so easily?
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 199.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' I tricked you, didn't I?
::Then that means Huohuo is...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then that means Huohuo is...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 200.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' You should have faith in your friend... Perhaps Huohuo is safe and sound &mdash; perhaps she's managed to subdue the heliobi? If you rush to Cloudford, there's still a chance you might find her...

:Hanya carefully examined Huohuo's vital signs.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 158.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' She's unresponsive. It looks like a heliobus has taken control of her mind.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How could this happen?
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 159.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Huohuo spent a long time in coexistence with a heliobus &mdash; it is likely she became accustomed to that state. With Tail now gone, she was relatively defenseless against other heliobi.
::Should we try using the Harmonic Chime?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we try using the Harmonic Chime?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 160.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' This isn't just a heliobus illusion, it's a complete sensory barrier &mdash; cutting off the individual from the outside world. In this case, even the Harmonic Chime won't work.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 161.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' This isn't something the healers at the Alchemy Commission can handle. I'll take Huohuo back to the Ten-Lords Commission &mdash; perhaps they'll have an answer.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 162.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' As for now, I'm temporarily suspending the activities of the ghost-hunting squad.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 246.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' But...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 163.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' The situation has changed completely. Without the assistance of a judge, continuing would place all of you in grave danger &mdash; defeating the purpose of the squad.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 247.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' But, Miss Hanya, this is to save our friend!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 164.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' I know, I understand. But please, let the Ten-Lords Commission deal with this. We'll find a way to extract this heliobus from Huohuo.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 248.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Miss Hanya, tell me straight... Does the Ten-Lords Commission actually have a solution?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 165.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Surely the Ten-Lords can fix this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's interrogate Cirrus!
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 249.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, Cirrus is bound to know what this heliobus is up to.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 230.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' No, we shouldn't do what they expect us to. They've been manipulating us from Fyxestroll Garden all along. We need to find out what they really want before we go any further.

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy tail 142.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Excuse me?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 173.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' Despite Cirrus's scheming and calculating, they clearly didn't expect Tail to return to Huohuo... their plan to kidnap her was an utter failure. If they saw Huohuo as she is now, it would break their will!

::{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 176.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' No wonder they like to use analogies such as "pawns" and "chess" to describe people. One momentary lapse of concentration, and suddenly we find ourselves backed into a corner.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cirrus was waiting for us to leave Fyxestroll Garden all along.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 281.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' ...It's not because of me, is it?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy hanya 177.ogg}} '''Hanya:''' There's no need to blame yourself. This was Cirrus's plan all along.
