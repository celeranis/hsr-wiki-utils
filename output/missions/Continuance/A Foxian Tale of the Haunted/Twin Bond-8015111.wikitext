:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 153.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Let's... let's try a new strategy... I don't think we can beat them like this. We need to use our heads...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I barely broke a sweat.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 154.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Then... good for you! But you should probably catch your breath first... I could hear you panting from a mile away.
::I think I'm hyperventilating.

::Anyone bring a hunting trap?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Anyone bring a hunting trap?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 164.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Huh? We can't hunt the Dragon Lady like a wild beast...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 160.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Wait, I have an idea! How about we use a little reverse psychology? Instead of chasing Lady Bailu, we get her to come to us!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 155.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Are you serious? Does that little dragon girl look like she's gonna come running over to us?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 161.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Chasing Bailu around like this reminds me of something I saw back home when I was a child. On my home planet, resources were scarce, and if you wanted to eat meat you had to risk your life by going deep into the mines to hunt an animal called a sky mink.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 162.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Sky minks fly so nimbly and are so alert that even the quickest of hands will have a hard time catching them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are we having story time all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you get the meat? How does the story end?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 156.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Gather round children!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 163.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Ugh, don't interrupt! Hear me out. The sky mink's ecology is unique &mdash; it lives in symbiosis with a venomous creature called a shrieking lizard. When a sky mink goes out to feed, it lets the lizard protect its young.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 164.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' So we used to go to sky mink nests to catch shrieking lizards, instead. When a shrieking lizard gets caught, it calls to the sky mink with a loud shriek to warn it to return to the nest and protect its young... which of course, led the sky mink right to us.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds a little cruel...
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 165.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Well, the competition for survival went two ways &mdash; shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom, and failure to take proper precautions cost many a hunter their life.
::Sounds pretty smart...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds pretty smart...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 166.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I'd hesitate to call it that. Shrieking lizards spew out a potent venom &mdash; many people lost their lives trying to catch a tiny morsel of meat for dinner.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 157.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Nice story. But what's it got to do with chasing Lady Bailu?
