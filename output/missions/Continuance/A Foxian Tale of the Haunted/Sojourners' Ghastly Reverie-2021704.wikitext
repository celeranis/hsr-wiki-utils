{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|Cirrus claims to know Furynox like the back of its hand, and proposes a game changer of a counter. But does this shifty creature really want to help humanity win? Or could it be that it secretly harbors ulterior motives? We'll never know what's up its sleeve unless we let it play its trump card. You're nervous, but you have to hold on until that trump card gets played.}}

:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 189.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' You've heard the story of Ignamar and the great heliobus's glorious fight against the general. They were an entity born of many heliobi fusing together...
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 190.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' ...but heliobi are gradually tainted by the emotions and desires of those we possess. We tend to spite each other and don't like to fuse together &mdash; it's like having multiple personalities inside a single head. It leads to "infighting..."
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 191.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' A powerful heliobus like Ignamar or Furynox might be able to swallow a lesser heliobus and placate them for a while...
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 192.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' ...but this internal balance is easily broken when exposed to external forces &mdash; just like how we were torn apart and reborn after Ignamar fought the general.
:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 156.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Therefore... this might be the way to defeat Furynox. We can cause them to break apart and reduce their power, then the Ten-Lords Commission can use their sacred vessels to seal up all of Furynox's fragments.
:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 157.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' I have a question. Why are you betraying your own kin? Why would you help the Xianzhou when we have sealed you for so long?
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 193.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Why? Must heliobi always have a reason for their behavior? Perhaps I don't want Furynox to devour me. Perhaps I dislike idiots who use force and nothing else. Perhaps I wish to fight the general myself...
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 194.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' ...or maybe I just want to do a favor for the Ten-Lords Commission that will ensure I can leave here in one piece?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We should allow Cirrus to go ahead with their plan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't believe Cirrus!
:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 158.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Judges of the Ten-Lords Commission always keep our promises. If you can truly deal with the problem at hand, I will ask for your freedom from the Ten Lords. However, I cannot guarantee the outcome of the appeal.
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 195.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' How conventional. Fine, I accept... but you better keep your promise, puppet.
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 196.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Hehe, me and Furynox were "furnacemates..." I know them well. They are powerful, but as naive as a child and obsessed with victory. I only need to say three things to incite them.
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 197 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 197 f.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' (Trailblazer), I'll need your body for a while longer.

:{{A|VO side2 hh huiyan 104.ogg}} '''Distant Voice:''' I've turned this garden into my territory and made the dogs of the Ten Lords my puppets! As soon as the general arrives, the heliobi will have our rematch. Why should I fight my own at this crucial moment?

:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 199.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Oh, do puppets feel empathy? Or do you not wish to defeat Furynox anymore? We heliobi think of such matters as business transactions. As long as something can bring us victory, we will destroy everything &mdash; even allies and kin.
:{{A|VO side2 hh fuyan 200.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Make the decision. Furynox's pawns &mdash; your companions &mdash; must be destroyed.
:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 160.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' ...

:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 163.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' This is the Lunaumbra Gourd, a sacred vessel made by the Artisanship Commission. The Ten-Lords Commission has made some changes to it to better suppress heliobi. After you fight the puppets controlled by Furynox, make sure you seal their heliobi fragments in here.
:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 164.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Also...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll look after Huohuo.

:{{A|VO side2 hh xueyi 168.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Faced with a demon that can manipulate life at will, of course I'm afraid... Afraid that I won't ever work with my sister again.
