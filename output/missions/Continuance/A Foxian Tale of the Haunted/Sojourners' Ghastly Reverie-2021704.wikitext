===Go to Swallowsong Pavilion as proposed by Cirrus and chat with Furynox===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|Cirrus claims to know Furynox like the back of its hand, and proposes a game changer of a counter. But does this shifty creature really want to help humanity win? Or could it be that it secretly harbors ulterior motives? We'll never know what's up its sleeve unless we let it play its trump card. You're nervous, but you have to hold on until that trump card gets played.}}

===Talk to Xueyi and come up with a strategy===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|Cirrus claims to know Furynox like the back of its hand, and proposes a game changer of a counter. But does this shifty creature really want to help humanity win? Or could it be that it secretly harbors ulterior motives? We'll never know what's up its sleeve unless we let it play its trump card. You're nervous, but you have to hold on until that trump card gets played.<br />With the fall of Fyxestroll Garden, the Judges' suppression of the heliobi fell short at the final hurdle. Now, the only ones the Xianzhou can count on are you and the timid Huohuo.}}

===Go to the Verdantia Terrace to meet up with Xueyi===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|Picking them off one-by-one was a master stroke. You and Huohuo should go back to the Verdantia Terrace and quash the remaining heliobi in the Lunaumbra Gourd into the Evil Binding Matrix. Tonight should mark the end of this farce.<br />In your view, this is simply an inadequate horror farce. Such foolish monsters and an overpowered protagonist... Given the circumstances, can there be any more twists?}}

===Defeat the host and collect heliobus fragments===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|According to Cirrus, once this gambit between it and Furynox comes into play, you can seize this fleeting opportunity to defeat the parasitic host Furynox is occupying, then collect all the scattered heliobus spirits into the gourd.}}

===Defeat Cirrus===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|Unfortunately, things always change when you least expect it. The tiny, piteous but vicious heliobi are waiting for precisely the moment when everyone lets down their guard.<br />Please! Huohuo, please do something with that indomitable Mr. Tail of yours!}}
