{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|The dust has settled... quite literally. After a night full of twists, noise, and running around with the Judges, you've finally reached the end of this eerie tale. But, just like most horror movies you've seen, directors always like to leave hints for a sequel... You pray to the heavens that there won't be a sequel!}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Aurum Alley|update|This has now all come to an end, for the time being. Huohuo is worried about Guinaifen, and she hopes you can pass the news on soon to Guinaifen's bestie, Sushang.<br />Not going with Guinaifen to Fyxestroll Garden may have been the correct decision for Sushang to make, but it may also be one that she might come to regret... Anyway, let's go have a chat.}}
