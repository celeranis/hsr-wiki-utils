===Search for traces of Tail{{subst:void|<!--801511401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Immola|Huohuo, beguiled by the heliobus, can only searches for traces of Tail in the illusion. She is yet unaware of what she will encounter &mdash; heliobi will find the host's most painful and vulnerable emotions, and amplify them to unbearable heights.}}

===Find Huohuo's mother{{subst:void|<!--801511404-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Illusory Maze: Immola|update|Within the illusion, Huohuo once more experienced "the loneliness of being abandoned." Despite knowing that it is merely an illusion, she struggles to overcome it on her own.<br />Surely, Mr. Tail's departure has only intensified Huohuo's feelings of being alone.<br />Mr. Tail must do something, such as "bring everyone back."}}

To be more precise, Huohuo cannot be possessed by another heliobus while Mr. Tail is covering her. Go. Time to teach a lesson to the heliobus who possessed Huohuo.}}
