;(Talk to Fu Xuan)
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 132.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Let's begin. Lead the ingenium to the exit. Show me how many choices destiny gives you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright, make sure you're paying attention.
:{{DIcon|Exit}} (Remain silent.)
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 128.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' We did it!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 133.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Well done. Your choices are as the omniscia foresaw them. You should know that there was only one answer to this puzzle from the beginning, just as destiny has only one path!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's just a game.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This puzzle was designed by you.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 129.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Yes, for a puzzle that was designed from the start, choosing any other path would be a pointless mistake.

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 134.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' The path changed slightly, but it was just as simple. I'm sure the Master Diviner would say&mdash;
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 141.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Destiny only has one path. Your choices are just a predetermined solution to the puzzle.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 135.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Actually, I don't think I agree. Master Diviner, let's reset the sandbox and give it another go, shall we?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 142.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Again? Do it all over again, exactly as it was? You can try it a million times over, and a million times over it is doomed to the same fate &mdash; because there is only one path.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 143.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Hehe, I see what you're thinking, Qingque... you're an interesting one.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 208.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Qingque, I've been thinking through the calculations for this puzzle &mdash; there really is only one solution.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 204.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' This maze was designed by Keralum. It's no use &mdash; there aren't any other solutions. As long as we're playing this so-called game of destiny, we can't win.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 136.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' No, there's a second choice. There will always be another choice.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's all yours, Qingque.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 206.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' I didn't mean like that...

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 137 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 137 f.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Of course there's another solution to this sandbox. (Trailblazer), listen to my idea.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 138.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You're all gonna help, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There is more than one path...
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 139.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Correct.

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 152.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Even if I lose, I'll still make choices to lighten the loss &mdash; just like the Master Diviner is making choices for her own agenda.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 145.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' This is the other solution &mdash; the alternative choice. I created a new solution.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 146.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Master Diviner, you're not the only one who can design a puzzle, and I don't tread the path of destiny alone.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 145.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' ...Hahahaha... you think that by calling on your companions for help, you created a new path out of thin air?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy fuxuan 146.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' You're just playing with semantics. I could weave a thousand routes for you, but they lead to the same destination &mdash; so what significance is there in having a choice?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't even understand what Qingque is saying.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 147.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Creatures like you don't understand humans.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 148.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' The universe is like jade tiles on a game table. When the tiles are shuffled, the outcome is already predetermined.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 149.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Which tiles can be played, which tiles are leftover, what kind of hand the person next to you is trying to make &mdash; all of these can be determined through calculations. But if everything is just a calculation, the game loses its flavor.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 150.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Randomness and adaptability, ambushing your opponent, twists and turns, the balance of the elements &mdash; it's a mix of calculations, unknowns, and loss of complete control that makes Celestial Jade the kind of game it is &mdash; and those are the same things that give life its color and vibrance.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 151.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if I have a sure loss in front of me? No &mdash; the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 153.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You were right when you said that as Master Diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 154.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' In this vast universe &mdash; a game where there are only losers &mdash; our Master Diviner is making endless choices, fighting against the odds just so the Luofu can safely travel for another day. Hehe, in my book she's the best player there is.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 155.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Why would someone as talented as the Master Diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 156.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Heliobus, you cannot fathom the joys of humanity. You are imprisoned by the illusion of destiny, unable to free yourself, and you want everyone who peeks into the future to suffer the same pain as you.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 157.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You... You don't understand humans at all.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy xiyan1 101.ogg}} '''Keralum:''' Aghhhhh! Don't let them trick you, Fu Xuan! Don't push me away! Don't let her words fool you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fu Xuan is breaking free from their grasp!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 158.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Keralum, release the Master Diviner!
