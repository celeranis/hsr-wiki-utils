:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 102.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' C&mdash;Captain? You can just call me Huohuo.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Understood, Captain Huohuo.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 103.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' I'm really surprised that Madam Hanya asked me to be the leader of the ghost-hunting squad.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 104.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' After Tail disappeared, I thought for sure the Commission would ask me to resign, but for some reason... A&mdash;Anyway, I'll do my best to carry out my duties!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We're all counting on you, Judge Huohuo.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 105.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Actually, I'm not sure if I can be helpful anymore...
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 106.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' After Tail disappeared, I thought for sure the Commission would ask me to resign... but for some reason, Madam Hanya asked me to be the leader of the ghost-hunting squad.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 107.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' A&mdash;Anyway, I'll do my best to carry out my duties!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 108.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' As for our mission... Cirrus was locked up in Fyxestroll Garden, but there were a lot of other heliobi that escaped after the Creation Furnace was broken.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 109.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' According to the Ten-Lords Commission's understanding of heliobi behavior, they tend to roam densely populated areas in search of hosts... and wherever they go, there are bound to be reports of "supernatural phenomena."
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 110.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Little Gui, can you show us the website we'll be using for intel?
:<!--1-second delay-->
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 109.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Let's see... Ghast&mdash;ly Grayv... ee? Ghastly Gravy!? What kind of website is that?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 107.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Ugh, it's Ghostly Grove, not Ghastly Gravy!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 111.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Ghostly Grove is the most renowned website for paranormal enthusiasts on the Luofu. Everyone who loves the mysterious and the unexplained knows about it.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 112.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' I used to go there to read first-hand accounts of ghost sightings whenever I needed to build up my courage.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 113.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' We can get our leads from this website and then investigate them posing as paranormal investigators.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 114.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' That means we can operate more efficiently, and with a low profile... If people started to see a spiritfarer making door-to-door visits, they might begin to panic... and that would give the heliobi even more power over their hosts.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 108.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Look, I'm a new user, so I only have a few followers on this site... but based on past experience, once you get a following, people start flooding you with stories and news about paranormal activity.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if all the leads we get turn out to be fake?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A lot of paranormal activity is just people in costumes.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 109.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' We have our work cut out for us, that's for sure. Sometimes a lead is obviously fake, but other times... it's hard to tell from just a few words on the Internet.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 110.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' After all, some people will make up all kinds of nonsense to attract attention.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 110.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' So we still have to go out and fact-check the leads?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 115.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Mm. Plus, the spiritfarers from the Ten-Lords Commission will be carrying out their own investigation in secret as well.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 111.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Speaking of attracting attention... how do we get a following on a paranormal activity website? Sounds like Little Gui's department &mdash; she used me in some of her performances just to draw a bigger crowd.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 111.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' That's the easy part &mdash; we just post some videos of us ghost hunting... Uh, I mean, subduing heliobi! We're working for the Ten-Lord's Commission after all &mdash; we're gonna have the best content out there!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will the Ten-Lords agree to this?
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 112.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Madam Hanya has already given us the green light. We'll record our heliobi-hunting expeditions to get more followers, and then use the intel from our followers to find more heliobi. It's like a vicious cycle... W&mdash;Wait &mdash; a virtuous cycle!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does sound kinda effective...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 112.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Wait, aren't we supposed to be operating in secret?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 116.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Another thing we have to think about is that heliobi feed on the emotions of their hosts. They can even manipulate a host into revealing their deepest secrets...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 117.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Wouldn't posting a victim's personal information online... cause even more harm to the victim? I&mdash;I'm not trying to pick holes... just raising some concerns.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 113.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' The way I see it, "operating in secret" and "exposing the paranormal" go hand-in-hand.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 114.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' We won't reveal the names of any victims. We'll just post some pics and videos of the squad engaging in fierce battles with the supernatural! And then come up with some dramatic titles...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 115.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Like: "Little Gui Investigates: Ghost Tries to Scare Young Cloud Knight Girl on Creepy Road &mdash; Gets Owned..." Y'know?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 116.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' We'll turn the entire heliobi-hunting process into regular uploads. Viewers will see that there's nothing that scary about it, and there won't be any public panic!
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy sushang 113.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Why are you looking at me? Want a medal or something...? It does kinda sound like a good idea...
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 117.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Hee-hee, thanks bestie.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy guinaifen 118.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I feel like some of you aren't convinced by the whole online ghost-hunting thing... How about this &mdash; we take a look at the leads we have so far, and pick one to try out as a test run.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of heliobus is Luxie?

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 140.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' Luxie loves mischief. They give no thought to interfering in mortal affairs &mdash; their only concerns are entertainment and freedom. Among all the fragments of Ignamar, the one most likely to abduct your precious Dragon Lady... would be Luxie.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy mingchaiA 141.ogg}} '''Cirrus:''' We were sealed away for a thousand years &mdash; it's been ages since we last tasted the joys and sorrows of the world of humans. I'm sure Luxie was eager to find a new friend and wander the world with them.

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 148.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' If a heliobus possesses a great warrior, they might gradually take on a braver, fiercer persona... and if their host is a playful child, they may adopt a childlike spirit.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why is Cirrus so obsessed with fighting the general of the Luofu?
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy jingyuan 126.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The ancient legends recount that the Xianzhou once faced an invasion by a great enemy that threatened the annihilation of every race aboard the Xianzhou ships. In order to save the Alliance, a hero made a pact with the Flint Emperor &mdash; the predecessor of all heliobi.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy jingyuan 127.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' The Flint Emperor would aid the Xianzhou in battle, and if they were victorious, the hero and their followers would lose their physical bodies for eternity.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy jingyuan 128.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' When the fighting had ceased, none of the heroes survived, and the Flint Emperor was gravely wounded. Thus, the pact was unable to be fulfilled. As the centuries came and went, the story faded from memory. But the heliobi remember.
::{{A|VO side2 hzzy jingyuan 129.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' They hold claim to this debt for all time. The great battle between General Teng Xiao and Ignamar was fought largely for this reason.

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Aurum Alley|update|After successfully exorcising the heliobus in Bailu, your next task is to publicize this victory on Ghostly Grove. However, you must minimize the public's perception of how dangerous the incident was to prevent panic, while also trying to stand out online to showcase the ghost-hunting squad's triumph. The task of writing a social media post is not any less challenging than exorcising the heliobus!}}
