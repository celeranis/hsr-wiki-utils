===Talk to Guinaifen and post on Ghostly Grove about the anomaly having been resolved===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Divination Commission|update|After successfully exorcising the heliobus in Fu Xuan, your next task is to publicize this victory on Ghostly Grove. However, you must minimize the public's perception of how dangerous the incident was to prevent panic, while also trying to stand out online to showcase the ghost-hunting squad's triumph. The task of writing a social media post is not any less challenging than exorcising the heliobus!}}

===Get information out of Cirrus===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Fyxestroll Garden|update|The entities most familiar with the temperament and habits of heliobi are none other than other heliobi also confined within the furnace. As the duel promised by the general still stands, it makes Cirrus currently the ideal source of information. Ask it about the heliobus in the Divination Commission.}}

===Ring the "Harmonic Chime" and talk to Fu Xuan===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Divination Commission|update|Use the Ten-Lords Commission's sacred vessel "Harmonic Chime" to enter the illusion shared by Fu Xuan and the heliobus, and try to talk with Fu Xuan. The master diviner and the Matrix of Prescience both remain motionless, and everyone around her seem to be possessed. Could this be caused by the heliobus?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Wake Fu Xuan up using force===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Divination Commission|update|Since the master diviner is not herself, you can always softly knock her sleeping mind awake with the baseball bat in your hand. This is also a means of exorcism.}}

===Talk to Fu Xuan and try your best to wake her up===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Divination Commission|update|Fu Xuan seems trapped in a deadlock of thoughts, attempting to prove to you that "if everything is predestined, then everything is futile."
