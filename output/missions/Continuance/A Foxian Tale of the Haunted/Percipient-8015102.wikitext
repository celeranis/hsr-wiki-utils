:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 147.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Creatures like you don't understand humans.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 148.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' The universe is like jade tiles on a game table. When the tiles are shuffled, the outcome is already predetermined.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 149.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Which tiles can be played, which tiles are leftover, what kind of hand the person next to you is trying to make &mdash; all of these can be determined through calculations. But if everything is just a calculation, the game loses its flavor.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 150.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Randomness and adaptability, ambushing your opponent, twists and turns, the balance of the elements &mdash; it's a mix of calculations, unknowns, and loss of complete control that makes Celestial Jade the kind of game it is &mdash; and those are the same things that give life its color and vibrance.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 151.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Do my "choices" at the game table mean nothing if I have a sure loss in front of me? No &mdash; the choices are what make the game meaningful in the first place.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 153.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You were right when you said that as Master Diviner, you must comb through the complex threads of destiny day after day, all for the preservation of this giant ship.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 154.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' In this vast universe &mdash; a game where there are only losers &mdash; our Master Diviner is making endless choices, fighting against the odds just so the Luofu can safely travel for another day. Hehe, in my book she's the best player there is.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 155.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Why would someone as talented as the Master Diviner go through the trouble of making endless choices if the end result is predetermined?
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 156.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Heliobus, you cannot fathom the joys of humanity. You are imprisoned by the illusion of destiny, unable to free yourself, and you want everyone who peeks into the future to suffer the same pain as you.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 157.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You... You don't understand humans at all.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy xiyan1 101.ogg}} '''Keralum:''' Aghhhhh! Don't let them trick you, Fu Xuan! Don't push me away! Don't let her words fool you!

:{{A|VO side2 hzzy huohuo 198.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' We could try ringing the Harmonic Chime... If we're close enough, we should be able to enter the heliobus's illusion.
:{{A|VO side2 hzzy qingque 123.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' But before I leave, I have to help these guests take care of some trouble here at the Commission. If I don't, people will think I was fired because of cowardice in the face of danger.
