::Please, listen to me! You're in serious danger right now. If you don't get treated soon, your brain will eventually burst!
::Wait! Since I am now a ninja hero who can contend with evil ninjas...
::Might I... lend you a hand?
::*Ninja Slang*, you're asking me this now. Do you have a death wish?
::You want to go on The Hunt? Know that this is a road of no return!
