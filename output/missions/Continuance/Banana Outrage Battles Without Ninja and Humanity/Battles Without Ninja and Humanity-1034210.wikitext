Together with Rappa, you defeat Profnana, the mastermind who has been exploiting all monkeys' desires. Although Profnana's true form escapes from Asdana, tranquility is restored to the Dreamscape and Paperfold University's anniversary festival can finally kick off again. While the crisis of the atavistic experiment may seem to be thwarted, it only marks the prelude to the Galaxy Rangers' next hunt...
