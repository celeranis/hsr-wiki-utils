{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Dreamflux Reef|These lil' fudgin' monkeys are tossing banana peels everywhere like it's nobody's business. Since there's no janitor in this dump, you might as well lend a hand in cleaning up.<br />With your pistols as your broom, of course.}}

===Hit up March 7th and Montana! Let's chill together!===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|So, this director bro isn't too keen on monkeys, but he sure beats around the bush just like those shirthead monkey lovers. Can't blame them, because your colleagues never really got the hang of talking plain human language. Once you've fixed your Synesthesia Beacon, you'll teach them how to talk like a straight shooter.<br />But hey, this dude's narrative looks interesting, so why not pitch in and help recruit actors?}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|This hunt is a blast, with tasty malt juice, hilarious monkeys, and a fudgin' awesome party! Yeah, it's a bit off the wall, and things don't always add up, but just like they say in the movie you watched last time... Dang, what was that line again...?<br />"If everything can be explained, this world would lose its touch of enigma."}}
