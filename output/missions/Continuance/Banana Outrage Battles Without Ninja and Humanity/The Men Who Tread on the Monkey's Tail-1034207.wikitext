He proposes a solution: Rappa's memories, infused with the ninja memetic virus, can neutralize the existing virus. To extract the antidote, you delve into Rappa's past using Clockwork &mdash; She is in fact a super experimental subject created by an atavistic experiment. The person she refers to as Master Kucha, supposedly her ninjutsu mentor, was a scientist who was stung by conscience and turned against Dr. Primitive at tremendous cost, all to protect Rappa, whom he sees as his daughter.... This is what motivated her to join the way of The Hunt.
