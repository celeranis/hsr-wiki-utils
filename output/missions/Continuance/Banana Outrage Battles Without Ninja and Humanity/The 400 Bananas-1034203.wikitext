::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 115.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' The audition process is simple. You need only answer a few questions. Of course, I won't be judging based on your answers alone. I will be watching your every move on camera.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 116.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' I know you're Penacony's Festive Superstar, so I expect you to show me what you're made of.

::Thanks for the compliment.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 122.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' You're welcome. And you're very polite. Good etiquette can get you far in this industry.
::Of course!
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 123.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Heh, you're confident. Good. A confident performer tends to delight the audience with surprises.
::How do you know?
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 124.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Knowing how to read people is a basic skill for a director. The way a performer speaks and behaves reflects their personality. For example, you expressed curiosity just now, which is a driving force for learning.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 125.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Now, for the first question: Please, introduce yourself.
::I'm one of the Nameless on the Astral Express.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 126.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Mm-hmm, that is indeed an important aspect of your identity. A very honest answer.
::I am the Festive Superstar, a shareholder of Penacony.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 127.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Emphasizing your most respectable status to demonstrate your personal worth. Very astute.
::I am Galactic Baseballer, AKA Baseball Bat Ninja.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 128.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Haha! Joking with the examiner during an exam. You have a desire to perform.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 129.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Okay, second question. What are you most proud of about yourself?
::I'm willing to put my life at risk.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 130.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Oh, I get what you mean. The ability to not shy away from danger can bring great value when film-making.
::I can take a beating.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 131.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' I suppose you mean you're in good shape? Yes, the cast welcomes newcomers who are hardworking and persevering.
::I'm thick-skinned.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 132.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Very good! Staying calm and sanguine is essential when you're on stage. It is a talent most performers yearn for.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 133.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Now, for the third question. I'll let her do the honors.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 134.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' This is my assistant director. A reliable partner who's skilled at cinematography, script supervising, editing, and more &mdash; has a better eye than me when it comes to casting performers.

::She didn't say anything.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 136.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' The camera can convey everything in place of words. Her silence is a question and your reaction is an answer. You gave a logical answer.
::She's very cute.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 137.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Ooh, you were tactful in the face of someone making things difficult for you. However, the assistant director doesn't like to be praised for her appearance.

::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 138.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Fine, pretend I didn't say anything. She's very happy with your praise.

::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 140.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Now, the final question...
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 141.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Nameless, your memory began onboard a station of Erudition, where you then boarded a train of Trailblaze. In your journey, you witnessed the will of Preservation, the determination of The Hunt, and the dispute between Harmony and Order...
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 142.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' You ran across many different sets and witnessed many different stories. Did you find a theme or perhaps a dream that belongs solely to you?
::How do you know so much?
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 143.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' It's only natural for a director to familiarize himself with a performer's resume before an audition.
::Yes, I found it.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 144.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' I see. Congratulations on having a clear goal. Your film will surely be a hit at the box office.
::No, I haven't found it.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 145.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' I see. That's alright. An open theme can encourage creativity.
::I refuse to answer.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 146.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' A very individualistic answer. You have a style that can hook an audience, just like how you've piqued more of my curiosity.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 147.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' CUT! You have finished your exam. Let's take a look at your results...
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 148.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Most of your answers were calm and composed, like a reliable cinematographer. Combined with your experience in assisting the Architects, the best academy for you is... Dreamweaver Academy!
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 149.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Most of your answers were clever, like an astute producer. Combined with your experience in dealing with the Interastral Peace Corporation, the best academy for you is... Fortune Academy!
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 mrreca 150.ogg}} '''Mr. Reca:''' Most of your answers were humorous, like a celebrity in front of a camera. Combined with your experience in winning the Festivity Auditions, the best academy for you is... Charmony Academy!

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm satisfied. I'll take it.

::{{A|VO chapter3 33 qialika 106.ogg}} '''Chaletka:''' N&mdash;No, we're hosting a Dreamscape Patissier Challenge. Students can choose from the ingredients provided by the Dessert Club and design their own... banana pie.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 124.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Banana pie?
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 qialika 107.ogg}} '''Chaletka:''' Because of Slumbernana Monkey's popularity, all kinds of banana dishes have become popular... Please, give it a try.

::{{A|VO chapter3 33 qialika 109.ogg}} '''Chaletka:''' The sour jadegreen banana from the Vonwacq rainforests. The intense bloodthorn banana commonly used as seasoning. And the extinct golden Slumbernana that was once popular across the universe but now only exists in sweet dreams...

::{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 126.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Why is there chili sauce?
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 qialika 112.ogg}} '''Chaletka:''' B&mdash;Because Paperfold University students come from many different planets. One of the members said they dip everything in chili back at home.
::Add sweet dream icing.

:{{A|VO chapter3 33 mar7th 203.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Seals? Oh, the grafitti the student from the Disciplinary Committee was talking about.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 124.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' Cause and effect is a wondrous thing. It allowed me to reunite with you, the Nameless Ninjas. Ninja Hiryū may not recognize me, but he must remember my colleague: A Ninja Hero clad in silver armor. He has a bold, easy confidence, is proficient in the use of bullet ninjutsu, and frequently spouts sweet and melodious words...
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 125.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Silvergun Shura}}!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Silver who now?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Shura huh?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I know who that is...
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 139.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...Is it Boothill?
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 126.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' Precisely.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 140.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Does that mean you're also a Galaxy Ranger?
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 127.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' Of course. I didn't want to cause a misunderstanding, so I emphasized the title Ninja Hero.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 mar7th 204.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' They both mean the same thing?
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 141.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So we now know who checked into the hotel. But why are the Galaxy Rangers revisiting the Dreamscape?
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 128.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' Ninja Hiryū. You and your companions are all elite ninjas who follow the true teachings of Trailblaze. You should know in the Cosmic Ninja Realm, there are many extraordinary individuals like me, but also evil ninjas.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 129.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' So long as the Evil Ninja still lives, danger that requires the presence of us Ninja Heroes will never cease. The reason I visit Pinecany is to hunt down one such scoundrel.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 130.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' He wreaks havoc across the universe with his fiendlings in tow. He is the enemy of the Ninja Capital and my archenemy &mdash; Evil Ninja Osaru.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 142.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' ...Do you know what she's talking about?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's playing ninja games.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 rappa 131.ogg}} '''Rappa:''' I can hear you.
::A historical account of the ninja realm logged in the Ninja Scrolls.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 143.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Forget I asked.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A historical account of the ninja realm logged in the Ninja Scrolls.
::{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 143.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Forget I asked.
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 144.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' This is troubling. If she really is a Ranger, we have to take her story seriously. Perhaps something has happened in Penacony.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we take action?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we contact The Family?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we run?
:{{A|VO chapter3 33 danheng 145.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The situation isn't clear. We shouldn't act rashly. After all, we're currently here as guest students.
