===Attend the Dreamweaving class with your classmates===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Penacony Paperfold University College|Leisurely break time is almost over, and it is crucial to be on time for your first lesson. Please do not be late, refrain from chatting in class, and focus on the lecture... although you might be tempted not to. Rules are made to be broken, after all.<br />Head to your first class and hope that the Dreamweaver Academy is not actually getting students to start with manual labor.}}

The school environment is surprisingly open-minded.<br />Look, your classmates have shown up.}}
