This place resembles Dream's Edge, but as far as you remember, there are no zoos in that area.<br />Check out that bizarre monkey. What if it's actually monkeys teaching at Paperfold University?}}

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Strange Dreamscape|update|Monkeys? Raps? Ninja... Why would a ninja be here?! This chaotic welcome... could it be that you accidentally left some of the Swarm's scale powder uncleaned in the Express? Or perhaps you haven't actually awakened from the dream of the Harmonious Choir? Or has someone tampered with your Dreampool using contraband SoulGlad? The mishmash of so many strange elements in the same dream feels like a jumbled creation by a third-rate dream bubble director running out of inspiration and making something using throwaway memoria.<br />In any case, you realize that you should leave this place as soon as possible!}}
