|summary       = Boothill encounters March 7th, who joined the Slumbernana Association by pure chance. By stealing the senior membership account of March 7th, "Master at Giving Up Thinking," Boothill gains an opportunity to confront the Slumbernana Monkey, entering an illusory realm capable of controlling one's mind. However, the resolute will of a Ranger is not to be swayed by monkey rhetoric. Once liberated from his fetters, Boothill wreaks havoc in the Slumbernana Association, leading the Profnana, who has sought refuge there, to run into the black hole in Dreamflux Reef together with his countless monkeys...
