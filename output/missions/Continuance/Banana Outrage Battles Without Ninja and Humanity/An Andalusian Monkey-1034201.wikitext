:{{A|VO chapter3 32 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The university plans to hold an academic conference on the topic of "Trailblazing" in the Moment of Sol. The Astral Express has been invited as guests to the conference.
:{{A|VO chapter3 32 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' An academic conference... You mean we'll have to sit in an auditorium and spend several system hours talking about a few hundred slides' worth of scholarly discourse?

::{{A|VO chapter3 32 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Sorry to disappoint, but Paperfold University doesn't issue certificates to guest students. However, I believe you'll gain something far more valuable than a certificate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Help! I don't want to go to school!
::{{A|VO chapter3 32 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Haha, don't worry &mdash; guest students don't get a lot of homework. Besides, all of the professors and students are busy preparing for the festivities. Just... treat it as a party.
