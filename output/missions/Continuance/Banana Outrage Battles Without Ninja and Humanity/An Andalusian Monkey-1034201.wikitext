:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Open it with violence
::You yell out something about trailblazing justice and courage, channeling all your strength into your arms, and attempt to make it open a crevice representing hope and fortune for you...
::But it is useless! Its lid does not move an inch, like it was designed to never be opened. This reminds you of those unopenable doors along Penacony's streets.

::You scrutinize the chest in front of you, but don't notice any encrypted interfaces, hidden text, or item submission slots &mdash; it looks like it definitely can't be opened.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Roll DEX once
::You try using your dexterity to pry it open... but this isn't the Simulated Universe. There are no dice. You also don't have any lockpicking tools available, nor are your hands reliably nimble &mdash; the roll ends in Critical Failure.
