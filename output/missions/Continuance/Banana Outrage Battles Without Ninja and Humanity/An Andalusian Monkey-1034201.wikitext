As youths with the right to receive an education (at least in external appearances), you, Dan Heng, and March 7th embark on a journey back to the Dreamscape as guest students. However, upon entering the Dreamscape, instead of the expected youthful ambience of a tertiary education facility, you face a thick stench of bananas &mdash; And, amidst a whimsical world filled with monkeys, you hear about the catastrophe in Penacony from a ninja named Rappa...

{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Parlor Car|The usually quiet group chat for the Crew suddenly buzzes with the prompt of a new message.

Head back to the Express and ask her about it!}}
