:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 103.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Dan Heng, you've returned twice, but it seems that meeting us fossils wasn't on your agenda. Regrettable, indeed. Now here you are to meet me anyway &mdash; life does love its ironies, doesn't it?
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 danheng 103.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I didn't come here with Miss Lingsha today to reminisce.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 104.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Indeed. When the Cauldron Master extends an invitation, it's only proper for the Preceptors to attend.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 lingsha 102.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' As the newly appointed Cauldron Master, there's been much to take care of within the Alchemy Commission. It's only now that I've had the chance to speak with you. Please forgive the delay, Elder.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 lingsha 103.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' I sent over some evidence regarding the prison break in The Shackling Prison. I trust you've already looked it over.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 105.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Yes, you sent us the remains of mara-struck soldiers, a map of The Shackling Prison, and a Semblance Reversion Essence pill.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 lingsha 104.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' These are the remains of assassins who used cloudhymn magic to conceal their tracks. They aided in the borisin's escape, allowing them unimpeded passage through The Shackling Prison.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 lingsha 105.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' That marked-up map is a map of prisoners' escape routes. Vidyadhara craftsmen once made blueprints for the prison's construction, so I imagine, Mr. Taoran, you have a similar map in your possession. This pill &mdash;
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 106.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Is Semblance Reversion Essence. Indeed, I helped plot the prison break in The Shackling Prison.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 lingsha 106.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' So the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus joining forces with the Lord Ravager to stir up trouble in the Alchemy Commission, the introduction of the Stellaron, and the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection &mdash; all have something to do with the Vidyadhara?
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 107.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' That's right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you admit it?
::{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 108.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Are you surprised? After all, both of you were sent here by the Seat of Divine Foresight as messengers, to hear my confession, weren't you?
::This is not unexpected, but it still brings me pain.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is not unexpected, but it still brings me pain.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 109.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' You were sent here by the general to hear my confession, weren't you? If there's even a shred of empathy in you, you should understand the reasons behind everything I've done.
:{{A|VO chapter2 16 taoran 110.ogg}} '''Taoran:''' Ever since the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the population of the Vidyadhara has dwindled. With the high elder exiled, a few of us Preceptors had to do what we could to turn the tide. My methods might have been drastic, perhaps even incomprehensible, but it was all for one cause &mdash; the survival of the Vidyadhara.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:A small incense burner, commonly seen in the Alchemy Commission and Divination Commission, quietly smolders, its wisps of smoke nearly indistinguishable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Snuff it out)
:You trust Lingsha's judgment. Clearly, the incense has been tampered with. It must be extinguished immediately.
