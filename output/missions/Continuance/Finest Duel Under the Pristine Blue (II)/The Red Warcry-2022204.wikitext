{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Stargazer Navalia|Following Feixiao's advice, everybody abandons the large-scale hunt and begins to speculate about their prey's motives and agenda instead. As for Stargazer Navalia, the site where the wolves were first spotted, it shall become the hunting ground for the continued pursuit of the borisin.}}

:Two dual-hours before the Wardance convenes<br /><br />Stargazer Navalia
:Stargazer Navalia
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 yanqing 101.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I know I'm in no position to question your orders, but if I understand correctly, you already have intelligence about the borisin?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 101.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' That's right. My people are busy collecting clues now. What's the situation, Moze?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 moze 102.ogg}} '''Moze:''' General, before we completely lost contact with Jiaoqiu, I picked up a signal from his jade abacus. It won't take long before we locate their whereabouts.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 yanqing 102.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' If that's the case, shouldn't we immediately go there and join forces to eliminate the borisin? Why are we returning to Stargazer Navalia?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 102.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Looks like your general has only taught you swordplay, not the art of The Hunt.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 103.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' There's an old saying among the borisin: "In the forest, the hunter may easily become the hunted." While we may call ourselves the hunters now, chasing them blindly will only make us become the prey.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How can Hoolay... possibly hunt us down?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But we have the advantage in numbers, right?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 yanqing 103.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Are you joking, General? He's just a wolf who's been imprisoned for seven centuries. Even with his accomplices, they're no match for us numerous Luofu Cloud Knights. How could he consider us his prey?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 104.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Do not underestimate the enemy. Hoolay is not an ordinary borisin that can be easily killed. The advantage in numbers means nothing when we face that monster.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 105.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' A vicious beast, who hasn't tasted blood and flesh in seven centuries, is now lurking on the streets of the Luofu right before the Wardance. This is what makes the situation treacherous and unpredictable.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 yanqing 104.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' To him, the lives of ordinary people are just meat, ready to be devoured at any moment...
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 106.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Exactly. That's why we must succeed in our first strike, or the situation will spiral out of control.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 107.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' You've heard of this military tactic, right? When you surround your enemy, leave one side open for them to escape. A skilled hunter must be well-prepared, waiting for the prey at the most advantageous position.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where do those borisin want to go?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Stargazer Navalia the most likely place for them to come to?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 108.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' What would we do if we were the escapees from The Shackling Prison? While we can disguise ourselves and blend in with the crowd, we don't plan on staying here for long. In this case, what do we need most now?

:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 111.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Because I blocked all the relevant news, to make it seem as if nothing had happened.}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will the borisin notice something?
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 112.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Losing contact with their accomplices preparing the starskiff will surely put them on guard.
::Yanqing may have alerted the borisin?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yanqing may have alerted the borisin?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 113.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' If Yanqing hadn't scared them off, we would not have many clues.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 114.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' However, the more well-prepared a plan is, the longer it takes to adjust when it's disrupted. If any borisin wants to stick to the original plan despite the risks, they'll surely come back to Stargazer Navalia to check the situation.

:{{A|VO chapter2 12 feixiao 134.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' I know the methods of these abominations all too well. They always leave an escape route for their prey, allowing them to flee in fear.
