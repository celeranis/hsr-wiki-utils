::{{A|VO chapter2 17 yunli 101.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Unfortunately, only one master is here. I'm doing fine.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...The enemies were mostly taken care of by General Feixiao.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 17 yunli 107.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I heard a few versions of the story from the Cloud Knights who were there. The number of Wolftroopers went from a few dozen to thousands, and the number keeps rising. It's becoming more absurd by the minute!
