:Exalting Sanctum
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 101.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' As I said, I'm a healer, but my art of healing requires the culinary arts to be truly effective.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 102.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' The magic of my {{Rubi|cauldron|hot pot}} is its ability to make all kinds of medicines into dishes that patients can eat. When simmered and cooked together, any kind of medicinal herb or ingredient becomes a delightful delicacy.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 101.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Delicacy... but isn't that just one flavor overpowering the others?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 103.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Well, you have a point... Let me ask you this: If there's a fussy child who refuses to eat green peppers, what's the best way to make him eat them?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 102.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Stuff the kid's mouth with the green peppers and cook him alive in a pot.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 104.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Hahahaha! You have quite a sense of humor. I've heard that you borisin have lost many of your taste buds during the self-modification process, so you can't experience complex flavors. Only the "saltiness" of blood and flesh truly awakens your appetite.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 103.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' It's a shame I don't have any green peppers right now. Otherwise, I'd happily stuff them into your mouth and cook you alive in a pot.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 105.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' I'm just kidding. The answer is quite simple: Chop up the peppers and mix them with minced meat to make meatballs. This way, the flavor of the meat overpowers the taste of the peppers, and even a fussy child can enjoy them.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 104.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Can I just boil your tongue in this hot pot? I know you're trying to buy time until someone comes to your rescue.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 105.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' You said that Jingliu recently returned to the Luofu, right? Well, she did come back... but unfortunately, I also found out that she committed serious crimes and was escorted to another Xianzhou ship.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 106.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Do you really think you can delay our departure by provoking Lord Hoolay's desire for revenge with your clever little tongue?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 107.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' You see borisin as savages who know nothing about the Xianzhou, but in fact, we know all about your tracking tricks... like the jade abacus you're carrying and the cycranes in the sky.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 106.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 108.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' The more hope you hold in your heart, the greater your pain will be when death comes. I wonder if you can maintain your composure when I tear your throat open.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 101.ogg}} '''???:''' His composure is only a temporary effect of the medicine, and it will wear off soon, right?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 129.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Lord Hoolay.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 102.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' You pathetic foxians. For thousands of years, we were the ones who allowed you to live and who granted you civilization, but in the end, you chose to betray us for the "freedom" promised by the Xianzhou people.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 103.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' But it's alright. As long as you catch the scent of your {{Rubi|masters|borisins}}, you obediently return to us... no matter how far you run away.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Refute him by pointing out that they are the runaways)
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 107.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Run away, you said? Well, I'm not the one who's trying to run away right now.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Sow discord between Mok Tok and Hoolay)
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 108.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Hoolay, have you ever wondered why it took them seven centuries to come to your rescue?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 109.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 109.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' The borisin's era has long passed. Did they ever tell you these harsh facts before giving you hope for returning home, Lord Hoolay?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 110.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Now they're being crushed by the Merlin's Claw of the Yaoqing... by a foxian. They're hiding in remote corners of the cosmos, trembling with fear, like a wounded beast on its last legs, reaching out desperately for any fake hope of salvation, which in this case is you.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 104.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' The Merlin's Claw of the Yaoqing... A foxian? Very interesting. Tell me, Mok Tok, is he speaking the truth?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 110.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' ...He isn't lying. That lowly beast was a war slave who ran away from our pack! Cannon fodder! A thief! She stole our power and used her knowledge about us to fight us, using every dirty trick in the book...
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 105.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' And she bested you, Mok Tok. Fairness is but a pathetic excuse for the dead and defeated. Since our great pack has fallen apart, who told you that I was alive? And who sent you here?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 111.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' In our darkest hours, it was a Prophet of the Master of Immortality, named Mangas, who showed us the way. Her guidance brought us hope.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 106.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' This Prophet Mangas... What does she want?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 112.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' The Prophet made this proclamation: The borisin have been divided for too long, and only your return can unite all the packs, restoring us to our former glory! That's when we learned that you were still alive... It must have been a manifestation of the Master of Immortality!
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 113.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' And the Prophet told us that the foxian general of the Yaoqing would take you to her ship during the Luofu's Wardance, and that it would be our best chance to infiltrate and free you from your prison. And just as she said, we did it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Refute him by pointing out that their plan has not succeeded yet)
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 111.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Even if you managed to set Hoolay free, you'd have no way to escape.
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 114.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' We've already prepared our ships, and the Prophet's prediction will surely come true.
::(Sow discord by pointing out Mangas' ulterior motives)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Sow discord by pointing out Mangas' ulterior motives)
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 112.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' That so-called prophet lied to all of you. She just sent you here to die.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 115.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' But her prophecy has come true! Our Warhead is right here, with us!
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 113.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Once the news about the prison break spreads, the Cloud Knights will close all the ports. You may think you've escaped the prison, but you're just trapped in another cage known as the Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 116.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Let me kill this unruly lowly beast, Lord Hoolay! I assure you that our starskiffs will soon arrive.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 117.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' Right now, everyone in the Luofu is distracted by the stupid Wardance, so this will be the perfect chance to escape. Once you've returned to your territory, your revenge against the Xianzhou ships will be within reach.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 107.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Perfect chance? To return to my weak and shattered pack, at the mercy of a ridiculous false prophet, and become a mere puppet in her clutches? Heh, her plan is full of flaws. The only paths she has prepared for you are escape and death.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 108.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Listen up, a wolf never allows itself to become prey. From now on, you'll follow my orders.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 109.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Since you are so confident that the Cloud Knights will close the ports, Jiaoqiu, I'm now giving you a chance to go and see it for yourself. Go to the ports, come back, and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|tell me what you saw}}.
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 114.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' ...Wait, what did you just say?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 118.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' But my Lord...!
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 110.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Would an alpha wolf ever listen to a cub, Mok Tok?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 modu 119.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' No, I've never heard anything like that... I... I wasn't trying to defy your will. I will always unquestioningly follow your orders.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you send your people?
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 111.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don't you want to run away, Jiaoqiu?
::What game are you playing?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What game are you playing?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 112.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Just a little pre-hunt entertainment. Don't you want to run away?
:{{A|VO chapter2 12 hulei 113.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' You will come back, because foxians like you always obediently return to their masters... no matter how far they run away.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look exactly like a foxian...
::{{A|VO chapter2 12 jiaoqiu 119.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' So, that's how you managed to infiltrate the Xianzhou ship. If I hadn't been so familiar with the scent of borisin, I wouldn't have been able to tell.
