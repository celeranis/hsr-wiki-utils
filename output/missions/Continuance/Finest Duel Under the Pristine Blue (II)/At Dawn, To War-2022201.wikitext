:{{DIcon|Talk}} Discuss what happened...
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 11 player 101 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' There was a revolt in The Shackling Prison... Fortunately, we were protected by the guards until the Cloud Knights arrived to rescue us.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened on your end?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 11 yanqing 104.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I was planning to take Miss March and Yunli to Stargazer Navalia to see the Skysplitter up close, but we stumbled upon a group of suspicious foxians carrying official identities.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's your plan now?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 11 yanqing 108.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The borisin traveled all the way here to infiltrate the Luofu and attempt to rescue their leader with a crafty scheme... This is completely unlike them. To be honest, it reminds me of what the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus did during the Ambrosial Arbor Crisis.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those tourists over there are talking about you...
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 yanqing 111.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Yeah, I heard them, too, but I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint them. I've already reported to General Jing Yuan that I'll give up my role as the ringmaster.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? You're not going to defend the ring?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But haven't you been preparing for it for so long?
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 yanqing 112.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' The security of the Luofu is more important to me than anything else. I need to fulfill my duties as a Cloud Knight Lieutenant before taking on the honor of being a ringmaster.
::{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 feixiao 102.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' You may be tiny in stature, but your ambition matches that of the Yaoqing's warriors.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yanqing 116.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Hey, this has nothing to do with my height.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What brings you here, General?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought all the generals were on the move already?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 feixiao 103.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Yes, I suggested to Yanqing that we find a place to have a decent meal. A hunter must be well-fed before "the hunt."

While the Xianzhou alleyways seem as calm and peaceful as ever, wolves capable of shapeshifting have already hidden themselves in the crowd.<br />Meanwhile, March 7th and Yunli are at the Seat of Divine Foresight, listening attentively to General Huaiyan as he breaks down the situation at hand.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:After the Shackling Prison Break<br /><br />In the Seat of Divine Foresight
:At the Seat of Divine Foresight
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yukong 101.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' General Huaiyan, the Sky-Faring Commission has finished its preparations. Do you have any other instructions?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 101.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Representing the consensus between the Merlin's Claw and the Divine Foresight, I'll step in as the temporary commanding officer of the Seat of Divine Foresight and oversee the Six Commissions' affairs on the Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yukong 102.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' What is the situation at The Shackling Prison?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 102.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Hoolay made a quick escape and even sealed the gates of the prison. As of now, the Cloud Knights have re-established contact with the staff inside.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 103.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The good news is, the two Nameless who were trapped in The Shackling Prison are safe and sound.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 mar7th 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 11 mar7th 101 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Um, I know I shouldn't use the word "great" given the current situation... but I'm relieved that (Trailblazer) and Dan Heng are safe.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 104.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' We've lost contact with one of the messengers from the Xianzhou Yaoqing. The borisin have likely taken him hostage.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 105.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Don't worry, Yukong. Feixiao is leading the Wolf Hunt operation, and you know how capable she is.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yukong 103.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' I have no doubt about General Feixiao's capabilities, General Huaiyan. I'm more concerned about the Wardance.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yukong 104.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' According to the plan, the ceremony will begin in six hours. The Skysplitter will be activated, and all visitors will board the ship to watch the contest.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yukong 105.ogg}} '''Yukong:''' But now, with Hoolay's whereabouts unknown, everything is filled with uncertainty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should the Wardance really be held as scheduled?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yunli 101.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' March is right, Grandpa. I heard the escaped prisoner from The Shackling Prison is beyond formidable. In case anything goes wrong...
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 106.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' So, Yunli, what do you think we should do?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yunli 102.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Well... hmm... I believe we should declare martial law and allocate manpower to search for the escaped prisoners. And for the Wardance, it's better to announce an indefinite delay for now.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 107.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Your plan sounds solid, but unfortunately, solid plans rarely get a chance to be implemented. I believe there are at least two parties who won't accept your approach.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Which two parties?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 108.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The first are the many travelers who have come all the way here for the Wardance. If we declare martial law now, it's like declaring that the Luofu isn't safe. How do you think the outsiders would react? They'd be terrified, and chaos might ensue.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 109.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The second party is the staff of the Xianzhou Luofu's Six Commissions. They've invested a lot of resources and manpower into organizing the Wardance. Suddenly suspending it indefinitely would create numerous challenges for them.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 110.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' But of course, not everyone disagrees with your idea.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yunli 103.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...R&mdash;Really?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 111.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The mastermind behind this incident would fully support your opinion presumably.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 112.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Hoolay's escape and your discovery of borisin spies at Stargazer Navalia... Even a child could guess that these events were orchestrated.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 113.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' The fugitive is just one piece in the game. The one controlling the pieces wants to spread chaos and suspicion among the people on the Luofu. If we declare martial law and postpone the Wardance, we'll fall into their trap and instill fear in people even before Hoolay actually does anything.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yunli 104.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...So, what do we do?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 114.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' We'll search for the prisoners while maintaining order on the Luofu, acting as if nothing has happened.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 yunli 105.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' As if nothing has happened? Yanqing said he'd assist the generals, and now he's nowhere to be found. With the host's ringmaster gone, how are we supposed to act like nothing has happened?
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 115.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' That's why I called the two of you here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you suggesting that I take Yanqing's place as ringmaster?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you suggesting that Yunli takes Yanqing's place as ringmaster?
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Master Yunli, is General Huaiyan asking you to be the ringmaster instead of Yanqing?
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 116.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' No, that's not the case.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you planning to take up the role of the ringmaster yourself, General Huaiyan?
::{{A|VO chapter2 11 huaiyan 117.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Of course I'll do my part, but not on the Skysplitter.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' General Huaiyan... Are you asking me... to take Yanqing's place... as the ringmaster?
