;(Talk to Feixiao)
----
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 101.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' This hunt is finally over. Thank you for holding out so long. The Cloud Knights are withdrawing as we speak.
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 102.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Lieutenant Yanqing, how are you holding up?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I could take on ten more!
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 101.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I've never been better... I could take on ten more Hoolays...
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 103.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Take it easy, young one, your wounds look quite severe. I'll have the Alchemy Commission healers see to you when they arrive.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} General, how are things on the ground?
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 102.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' General... is everything okay on the ground?
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 104.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Everything's fine. We were able to suppress the borisin attacks. When I sensed that Hoolay was not on the ground, I raced to get here as quickly as I could.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You saved my life there.
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 103.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' I... I thought I was done for.
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 105.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' I wouldn't want General Jing Yuan to lose the disciple that brings him so much pride. When I sensed that Hoolay was not on the ground, I raced to get here as quickly as I could.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't believe you didn't tell me the plan...
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 104.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' ...General, I can't believe you didn't tell me about the plan for the Skysplitter!
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 106.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Don't blame me, this was your general's idea. When he learned that you gave up being the ringmaster to join my Wolf Hunt team, he insisted that I hide the plan from you. Perhaps he thought your impatience would mess things up.
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 107.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Well? You may have run all over the place, but you ended up back here, did you not?
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 108.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Who would have imagined that I would arrive late to the battlefield for the first time in my life? ...No, perhaps you young ones' blades were just too fast for me.
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 109.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' I originally thought, in the best-case scenario, you would team up and hold this beast back while protecting yourselves. However... You joined forces and defeated Hoolay! The youth are truly to be feared and respected!
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 110.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Come, we need to lock up Hoolay once again before anything unexpected happens.

;(Talk to Yunli)
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I&mdash;I was so scared! I thought you were a goner there! We're so lucky the general made it in time!
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 yunli 101.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Yanqing, that was amazing! The final blow you dealt to Hoolay, how have I never seen that before?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's my special finishing move.
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 105.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Do you want to learn it? I can teach you! But, I'll need some time to heal up first...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was it really us who defeated Hoolay?
::{{A|VO chapter2 15 yanqing 106.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Was it... really us who defeated Hoolay? Why do I feel like he suddenly started to flag during our battle?

;(Talk to Hoolay)
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 hulei 101.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' I thought... that this battle would end with a fight to the death against Feixiao. I never imagined I would be defeated by you.
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 hulei 102.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Such an unforgettable blade... So similar to the one wielded by {{Rubi|that woman|Jingliu}} who defeated me all those years ago.
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 hulei 103.ogg}} '''Hoolay:''' Over seven hundred years have passed, and I thought that I would have a way to overcome it by now. But in the end... my fangs and claws were too slow... You won, child.
:{{A|VO chapter2 15 feixiao 111.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Stop struggling, Hoolay. There's plenty of time for you to be tortured by your regrets when you go back to The Shackling Prison.
