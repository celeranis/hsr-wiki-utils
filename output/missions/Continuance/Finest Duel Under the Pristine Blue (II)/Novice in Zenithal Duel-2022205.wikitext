:Skysplitter
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wow! The Skysplitter's gun salute is really loud! So this is what the Wardance is actually like? I feel like my eardrums are going to burst.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 101.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Well, how could they expect to attract people to come and watch if they didn't make a huge spectacle? March, you haven't forgotten what you came to do, have you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What... did I come to do?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Who am I? Where am I? What am I doing here?

::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 103.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Great, you've finally gotten your memory back, and I can put down Old Mettle.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am here to be the ringmaster on behalf of Master Yanqing!
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' As a representative of the Xianzhou Luofu, I will defeat all challengers!
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 104.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That's the spirit, sounds like you're all fired up! If you could just keep your legs from shaking so much, it would be more convincing, March.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am here to ensure the safety of the Wardance!
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 105.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That was the mission my grandfather entrusted to me. You just relax and keep guard over the ring.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 106.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' As the saying goes, "The disciple takes the toil of their master." Remember, you are here under the identity of a Luofu swordmaster, taking the place of your no-good Master Yanqing as the ringmaster.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But what am I supposed to do if my opponent for this round is super talented and just wipes the floor with me in seconds? I'm still a beginner in swordplay! I don't know where I got the confidence when I agreed to help General Huaiyan.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 107.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Come on, there's no need to worry about that. If you are defeated, then your opponent shall have to answer to me! Although, if that happens, the honor and the glory of the Xianzhou Luofu shall all be taken by the Zhuming, hahaha...

There's no doubt that you have faced far more terrifying enemies than your opponents here today, right? Don't you feel a lot more relaxed looking at it that way?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yunli, I think I should drop out of the contest.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' There's so much pressure, my stomach is really hurting. Maybe... I should just drop out of the contest?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't we call Yanqing back?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Why don't we call Master Yanqing back? What kind of master would retire at the height of their career and leave their disciple to fight in their place?

::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong2 101.ogg}} '''Curious Spectator:''' Oh? And how big did you imagine this "impressive Skysplitter" to be? This big? This big, maybe?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong1 103.ogg}} '''Confused Spectator:''' Let me think... Hmm. I'd expect at least a four-hour journey by starskiff to the spectator seating from here. Otherwise it's simply not impressive enough!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wouldn't that be too big for no good reason?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong1 104.ogg}} '''Confused Spectator:''' The bigger, the better! If you ask me, the Skysplitter is nowhere near big enough and there are nowhere near enough cannons!
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong2 102.ogg}} '''Curious Spectator:''' This warship used to have loads of cannons.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're daydreaming about stuff that ain't gonna happen.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong1 105.ogg}} '''Confused Spectator:''' What's wrong with that? People are supposed to dream big! If you ask me, the Skysplitter is far too small!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I kinda think this place is a bit cramped too.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Skysplitter looks small from a distance, but it's even smaller than I imagined now that I'm on board.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 guanzhong1 106.ogg}} '''Confused Spectator:''' Hear that? This person gets it!

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any weaknesses?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 103.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' If I had to think of a weakness... Whenever I open my mouth, I make things awkward. Does that count as a weakness?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 104.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' I understand what's going on, Miss March 7th and Miss Yunli. I'm actually not a contestant. I'm just here as a security guard.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ah, so... that was a little bit awkward.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 105.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' It's alright. I can't bear to watch other people make things awkward, so I always try to keep the conversation going, but then I'm the one who ends up making things awkward. I've gotten used to it by now, so don't worry.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 106.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you could say it's all fair winds and calm "wolves."
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 132.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 107.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Another awkward pause, I knew it... Do you get it? "Wolves" sounds like "waves." It's a funny pun.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 133.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' He's actually explaining his joke!
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 108.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Ah, making things awkward really is my weakness...
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 134.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' There are still many guests arriving here. Please be cautious!
::{{tx}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 110.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' I am not a contestant Miss March. Please find someone else to talk to.

:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 122.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' So, this is the contestant hall.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' There are so many people!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 123.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' March, before the Wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 124.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' My grandfather always told me that "a weapon mimics its master." That means that a person's weapon will reflect their habits and personality.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 125.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You've seen me wield {{Rubi|Old Mettle|greatsword}} before, haven't you? Tell me, what did you observe from that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That Master Yunli is very strong.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Master Yunli's Old Mettle is taller than a person. Being able to wield a weapon like that must mean that you have ridiculous strength, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yunli has a fiery temperament.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Waving around such a giant weapon... Master Yunli favors using overwhelming force over strategy.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 126.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You are not wrong. My battle style has always been "simple and effective" &mdash; one cut and it's over.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Master Yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. I don't think you have very good taste.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 127.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. No one asked you to criticize my dear Old Mettle!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 128.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Observing the weapon that your opponent uses, assessing what kind of battle skills they excel at and where their weaknesses lie is the key to victory in battle. A shockingly heavy sword like mine, for example, is obviously not suited for a long, drawn-out battle. So, it would be best to find a way to drag the battle out.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} These contestants all seem very reliable.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 137.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Looking at these contestants, I suddenly feel a lot calmer for some reason...

::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 136.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Just make sure to maintain this composure when you go in the ring.
