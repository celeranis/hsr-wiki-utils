::{{A|VO chapter2 13 jizhe 119.ogg}} '''Reporter:''' Once the Wardance begins, you will be challenged by master swordsmen from many different worlds, Miss March 7th. Are there any that you are looking forward to facing in particular?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 jizhe 120.ogg}} '''Reporter:''' May I ask who that might be?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yanqing.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Carefully observe their... sword)
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 102.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Ah, yes... This is just a regular Cloud Knight devastator glaive.
:::Do you have any weaknesses?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any weaknesses?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 103.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' If I had to think of a weakness... Whenever I open my mouth, I make things awkward. Does that count as a weakness?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 104.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' I understand what's going on, Miss March 7th and Miss Yunli. I'm actually not a contestant. I'm just here as a security guard.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ah, so... that was a little bit awkward.
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 105.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' It's alright. I can't bear to watch other people make things awkward, so I always try to keep the conversation going, but then I'm the one who ends up making things awkward. I've gotten used to it by now, so don't worry.
:::Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 106.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Nothing out of the ordinary. I guess you could say it's all fair winds and calm "wolves."
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 132.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 107.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Another awkward pause, I knew it... Do you get it? "Wolves" sounds like "waves." It's a funny pun.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 133.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' He's actually explaining his joke!
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 shibing 108.ogg}} '''Soldier on Duty:''' Ah, making things awkward really is my weakness...

:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 122.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' So, this is the contestant hall.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' There are so many people!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 123.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' March, before the Wardance begins, allow me to give you one more lesson.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 124.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' My grandfather always told me that "a weapon mimics its master." That means that a person's weapon will reflect their habits and personality.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 125.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You've seen me wield {{Rubi|Old Mettle|greatsword}} before, haven't you? Tell me, what did you observe from that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That Master Yunli is very strong.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Master Yunli's Old Mettle is taller than a person. Being able to wield a weapon like that must mean that you have ridiculous strength, right?
::Master Yunli has a fiery temperament.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Waving around such a giant weapon... Master Yunli favors using overwhelming force over strategy.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 126.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' You are not wrong. My battle style has always been "simple and effective" &mdash; one cut and it's over.
::Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yunli has a fiery temperament.

::Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master Yunli doesn't have good taste.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Master Yunli's weapon looks so thick and heavy. I don't think you have very good taste.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 127.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I asked you to make predictions about your opponent's combat style. No one asked you to criticize my dear Old Mettle!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yunli 128.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Observing the weapon that your opponent uses, assessing what kind of battle skills they excel at and where their weaknesses lie is the key to victory in battle. A shockingly heavy sword like mine, for example, is obviously not suited for a long, drawn-out battle. So, it would be best to find a way to drag the battle out.
