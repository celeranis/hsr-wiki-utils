{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 109.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Moze, are you okay?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 104.ogg}} '''Moze:''' I... wasn't able to save Jiaoqiu. Hoolay was more cunning and powerful than I imagined...
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 110.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Tell me, how is he planning to declare this war against me...? With a one-on-one duel? Or with a hostage exchange, maybe?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 105.ogg}} '''Moze:''' Hoolay is planning on attacking the bustling streets of the Xianzhou Luofu.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 111.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' What did you just say?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yanqing 103.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Impossible! Even if there are still undercover borisin that we haven't sniffed out, Hoolay can't have more than a few dozen people. How is he planning on simultaneously attacking the streets of the Xianzhou Luofu?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 106.ogg}} '''Moze:''' He has an ace up his sleeve. Hoolay's body holds a plaguemark passed down through generations of borisin. I've seen him convert a foxian to a borisin wolftrooper with my own eyes...
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 107.ogg}} '''Moze:''' This is Hoolay's "declaration of war." His blood... It can cause foxians to rapidly transform and lose their minds. He has passed his blood to his minions and is planning to spread it across the Luofu and stir up panic!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're saying that there will be attacks all over?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 112.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' He wants to "encircle" us in one fell swoop... This beast is truly unpredictable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Evacuate all the foxians immediately!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yanqing 104.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Contact the Sky-Faring Commission and the Cloud Knights right away! Have them enforce a traffic ban and order all foxians to remain indoors until further notice!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 113.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' The moment you see your enemy's declaration of war, it means that they have already begun to take action.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 108.ogg}} '''Moze:''' But... if Hoolay succeeds in getting this panic to spread&mdash;
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 114.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Do you remember what I told you before? Hunting is about thinking in the same way as your prey, not just mindlessly chasing after them.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 115.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' What Hoolay wants is to see everyone on the Luofu descend into panic. He wants to see us lose our minds and waste our limited manpower scouring every inch of the Luofu for signs of an attack until we exhaust ourselves.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 116.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' It's like that party game that the people of the Yaoqing love to play: They hide an object under one of several bowls, then move the bowls around, and have you guess which one the object is underneath.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 117.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' The way I see it, this is all nothing more than misdirection...
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 118.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' No matter what Hoolay does, there is one truth that cannot be changed: He is trapped aboard the Xianzhou Luofu. The only way for him to escape is to find a ship.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And the only ship he is able to see is...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So his only option is the Skysplitter?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 13 player 101 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' Right now... the only ship he'd be able to see is the Skysplitter.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 119.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' In his eyes, that ship is full of countless hostages. That would be the best place for him to go. So that will also be our final battlefield.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yanqing 105.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' But, if we're wrong about this... If he goes somewhere else, or if he does as he said he would, and his minions infect the foxians everywhere with wolf blood... What do we do then?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yanqing 106.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' Are we just supposed to abandon those "less likely" locations?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 120.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' This is another lesson that you must learn outside of swordplay: Weighing your options and making a decision. There are always questions that we will ask ourselves but never be able to answer.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 121.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Before making a decision, we must destroy any hesitation that we are holding onto. Once we make a decision, we must fight off any regrets.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 122.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' There is a chance that we will make the wrong decision and allow our allies to be sacrificed in vain. There is a chance that we will predict our enemy's movements correctly, yet underestimate their strength and be overwhelmed in battle...
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 123.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' But being lost in hesitation and failing to take any action will always be more harmful than taking the wrong path. We must make a decision, no matter what.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 124.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' Everyone, listen up. I will personally take charge of Starskiff Haven, evacuate the people, and prepare for any possible attacks. I will do my best to ensure that things are safe on the ground.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 125 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 13 feixiao 125 f.ogg}} '''Feixiao:''' (Trailblazer), please lend us your strength as you did when the Ambrosial Arbor was reborn. I need you and Moze to go in search of Jiaoqiu.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me!
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 yanqing 107.ogg}} '''Yanqing:''' General, please entrust me with the safety of the Skysplitter! I was originally meant to participate in the tournament, so now it is only right that I return to the Skysplitter.
