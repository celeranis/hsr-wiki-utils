:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 111.ogg}} '''Moze:''' Every time she hits the battlefield she makes a mess like this.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 112.ogg}} '''Moze:''' She didn't even leave a single survivor to get intel from. One of these men must have known about Hoolay and Jiaoqiu's whereabouts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened just now?
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 113.ogg}} '''Moze:''' That was one of Feixiao's "arrows." Who knows what she used as an arrow to fire all the way over here.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 114.ogg}} '''Moze:''' If she hadn't given us a heads-up, we'd have all been wiped out with these little runts.
::{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 115.ogg}} '''Moze:''' Next time she appears in battle, make sure you keep your distance. You don't want to return to the Express in pieces, I'm sure?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That general of yours is way out of line!
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 116.ogg}} '''Moze:''' She... She's just very passionate. She sees every place as a battlefield where she can unleash hell.
:::Has that general of yours always been like this?
:::{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 117.ogg}} '''Moze:''' I wouldn't say "always"... But "often" would be fair. As soon as the heat of battle gets to her, she sees every place as a battlefield where she can unleash hell.
:::I want to see her fire another arrow with my own eyes...

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to see her fire another arrow with my own eyes...
::Moze sizes you up with a cold, indifferent gaze. You can almost hear the unspoken words in his expressionless face: "Is it not better to cherish your life instead?"
::Is Jiaoqiu still alive...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Jiaoqiu still alive...?
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 118.ogg}} '''Moze:''' ...He has to be.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 119.ogg}} '''Moze:''' A retainer like myself is nothing more than an insignificant shadow who stands by the general's side. But Jiaoqiu is different. Without his careful treatment, the general wouldn't even be here today.
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 120.ogg}} '''Moze:''' Hopefully, he can use that silver tongue of his to buy himself enough time...
:{{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO chapter2 13 moze 121 f.ogg}} '''Moze:''' (Trailblazer), take a good look around. If you can find one or two borisin that aren't dead yet, let me know.

:{{A|VO chapter2 13 modu 103.ogg}} '''Mok Tok:''' So decisive, so... brutal. She is more like a descendant of Duran than we who have fallen to our current state. No wonder the Warhead has his eyes on her.
