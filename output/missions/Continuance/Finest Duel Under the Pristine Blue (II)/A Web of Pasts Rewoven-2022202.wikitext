:{{A|VO chapter2 11 lingsha 103.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' According to Lieutenant Yanqing's report, he stumbled upon a few suspicious foxians at Stargazer Navalia. After following them, he discovered that they were actually borisin in disguise. This is one of the bodies.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 danheng 101.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Looking at him now, it's hard to imagine how he transformed into a foxian.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 lingsha 104.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' My alchemists detected some... complex ingredients in his remains, which might explain how these borisin were able to disguise themselves as foxians.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 lingsha 105.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Simply put, foxians and borisin share a common ancestry. Although they look completely different now, there isn't much genetic difference between them. This medicine allows borisin to temporarily change their shape into that of foxians.
:{{A|VO chapter2 11 danheng 102.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' So, in other words, if they stop taking the medicine, their true form will soon be revealed?
