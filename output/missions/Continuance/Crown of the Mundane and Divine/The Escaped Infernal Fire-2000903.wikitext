===Track the escaped infernal fire===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Asta was swallowed up by infernal fire before your eyes. You must find traces of the escaped infernal fire first.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Despite catching up to the infernal fire, its ability to shuttle through space allows it to escape again.}}
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Seclusion Zone|update|The infernal fire has once again escaped from before you. Its ability allowing it to warp between locations is certainly difficult to deal with}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Try to touch the fire wall===
{{Mission Description|type=continuance|location=Seclusion Zone|update|The infernal fire made bizarre walls of flame as it ran away. Passing through these walls of flame will cause deviations in your three-dimensional coordinates.}}
