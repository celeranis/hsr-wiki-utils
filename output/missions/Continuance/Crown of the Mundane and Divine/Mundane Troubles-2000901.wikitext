Oh, they're a riot &mdash; brimming with enthusiasm yet utterly devoid of intellect. It's as if evolution halted prematurely for them.
:{{A|VO side0 rto ratio 103.ogg}} '''Dr. Ratio:''' They want to start some new collaborations with Herta and have graciously extended an invite for me to play the role of science consultant. It's delightfully amusing. I can't wait to witness firsthand how these geniuses from the so-called "Super Smart Club" squander the IPC's vast resources.
:{{A|VO side0 rto ratio 104.ogg}} '''Dr. Ratio:''' However... this attack was timed a little too well. I can't help but wonder if someone leaked this information, and the attackers seized the opportunity. Herta's aloof response to these juvenile provocations? Almost as intriguing. What a delightful little puzzle.

The Legion's impact remains, and the Annihilation Gang is already paying a visit. It almost seems like this space station is more suited for the Path of Destruction than Erudition.
:{{A|VO side0 rto screwllum 112.ogg}} '''Screwllum:''' This "Duke Inferno," Ifrit, is a lifeform that hails from Fetora &mdash; a world long since destroyed. His race, the ever-burning fire demons, regard Nanook as their emperor and savior, but the Aeon has never cast their gaze upon them.
:{{A|VO side0 rto ratio 155.ogg}} '''Dr. Ratio:''' A group of pitiful lunatics. I like Dr. Primitive's assessment of them: "The value Nanook sees in the Annihilation Gang is perhaps far less than what one might see in a child who deliberately broke a vase."
:{{A|VO side0 rto ratio 156.ogg}} '''Dr. Ratio:''' The fire demons have a cruel temper and instinctively ignite and destroy items. Ifrit is particularly evil and cruel, even among his kin.
