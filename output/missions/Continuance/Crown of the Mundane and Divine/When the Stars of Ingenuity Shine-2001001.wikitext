::{{A|VO side0 rm asta 103.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Madam Ruan Mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so I asked the researchers to keep things simple.
::{{A|VO side0 rm herta 103.ogg}} '''Herta:''' I took her to see the portraits of the Society members a few days ago. I wanted to have the researchers make one for her as well, but she declined the offer.

:::{{A|VO side0 rm herta 105.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Of course, go find her yourself. She borrowed the Phase Flame to do some research as soon as she got here &mdash; haven't seen a trace of her since.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Ruan Mei a great person?

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about life outside of research?
:::{{A|VO side0 rm ruanmei 219.ogg}} '''Ruan Mei:''' I do not have a life outside of research. People always think this price is unimaginable, but it seems rather acceptable to me.
::{{A|VO side0 rm ruanmei 220.ogg}} '''Ruan Mei:''' I must admit, I'm not fond of scenarios where everything aligns perfectly with my expectations. An experiment should have its unforeseen twists.
