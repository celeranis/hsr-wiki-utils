::{{A|VO side0 rm asta 103.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Madam Ruan Mei doesn't like fanfare and probably wouldn't appreciate a crowd to welcome her, so I asked the researchers to keep things simple.
::{{A|VO side0 rm herta 103.ogg}} '''Herta:''' I took her to see the portraits of the Society members a few days ago. I wanted to have the researchers make one for her as well, but she declined the offer.

::{{A|VO side0 rm ruanmei 107.ogg}} '''Ruan Mei:''' I don't usually go in and out of the space station, and only discovered today that it was blessed with such calm, open views. It is a wonderful fit for the sweet fragrance of lotus leaves, plum blossom, sticky rice, and frosting sugar.

::{{A|VO side0 rm ruanmei 113.ogg}} '''Ruan Mei:''' Mmm, an outstanding dessert. Ten grams of cubed sugar, one dried and salt-preserved plum blossom. Baking and cooking are the same as nurturing a universe. The heat must be controlled, planning must be meticulous, and one must not panic... no matter what happens.
::{{A|VO side0 rm ruanmei 114.ogg}} '''Ruan Mei:''' Unfortunately, there are still too many people in the space station. The clamor is not fitting for desserts. By the way...
