::Your mind is completely blank. Your stomach is a vast sea filled with trillions of tons of crab paste.
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Mindblowing... That was incredible! You really can't judge a book by its cover. We shouldn't be looking at how frail our {{MC|f=gal's|m=dude's}} body is. I reckon 90% of {{MC|f=her|m=his}} body is just the stomach!
::The stall owner's praise reaches your ears, but you don't have the mental space to take it in. All you can think about is one thing...
::'''Rowdy Diner:''' Hey, look! {{MC|f=She|m=He}} is gonna throw up.
::'''Bystanding Diner:''' Haha. We've got a good show coming up!

::'''Food Stall Owner:''' ...Going to be all right, {{MC|f=sister|m=brother}}?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel awful...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Ha! Anyone with eyes can see that! You'll be fine. You're a winner!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I won...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' That's right, friend! Your victory was glorious!
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' From this moment forward, all of this stall's snacks are free for you. Your name will be added to the Competitive Eater Championship's Hall of Fame... This is a huge honor!
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Oh, right... I prepared a few special gifts for you. Here you go!

::Your mind is completely blank. Your stomach is a vast sea filled with trillions of tons of crab paste.
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' You did manage to eat all five plates of crab meat, but unfortunately... you went over twenty seconds.
::The stall owner's words reach your ears, but... you are already slipping into unconsciousness. You couldn't care about whether you won or lost. There's only one thing on your mind...
::'''Rowdy Diner:''' Hey, look! {{MC|f=She|m=He}} is gonna throw up.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel awful...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' I get it. I really do... What a shame! You were right on the cusp of victory...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I lost...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' ...Yes, my friend. Quite unfortunate! You were just a few seconds off from victory.
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' So... {{MC|f=sister|m=brother}}, I know that you feel terrible right now...
::'''Food Stall Owner:''' However, according to the rules, contestants who don't complete the challenge must pay for their meals. With that in mind, five plates of Deep-Fried Rock Crab cost 1000 credits. Would you like to pay now, or...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I admit defeat. I'll pay now.
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Nice! You are a customer who sticks to the rules. Quite a rarity these days... I'll remember you. Next time you stop by, I absolutely will give you an incredible discount!
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Thanks for your business, pal!
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Oh, right. If you want to participate in the Boulder Town's Competitive Eater Championship again, feel free to come by tomorrow. With your excellent ability, I guarantee that you won't need more than a few tries to beat the challenge!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a sly merchant...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' ...Hey, now. What's all that about? I told you the rules upfront. I need to earn a living too...
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Besides, look at you, {{MC|f=sister|m=brother}}. You're wearing such glamorous clothes... 1000 credits is probably nothing to you, right?
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Thanks for your business, pal!
:::'''Food Stall Owner:''' Oh, right. If you want to participate in the Boulder Town's Competitive Eater Championship again, feel free to come by tomorrow. With your excellent ability, you won't need more than a few tries to beat the challenge!
