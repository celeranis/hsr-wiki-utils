:'''Joanne:''' Emergency resolved, now let's continue &mdash; same problem this time?
:'''???:''' Well, I seem to keep... forgetting things lately.
:'''Joanne:''' I have told you many times before that it is very normal to forget things sometimes.
:'''???:''' No, I've been forgetting basic things. Like, my birthday, who my friends are. Or how I came to the space station.
:'''Joanne:''' Fine. Just to reassure you, I will give you a full-body scan using the capsule treatment module this time. There's nothing wrong with your physical functions.
:'''Joanne:''' On the contrary, they're a little... too perfect. Of course, that's your gift. After all, having a talent is not an unusual occurrence, and your talent seems to be your physical health. So, in turn, it's only fair that you might have a poor memory.
:'''Joanne:''' With such a perfect physical condition, I better keep this on file. Let me make a record of this. What's your name?
:'''???:''' Oh, yes, Dr. Joanne. My name is...
:'''???:''' Sheila Nova.
:(Sheila Nova... That's the name mentioned in the video.)
:(In the video recording, she clearly left the space station. She even... died.)
:(There must be something to this. It also matches the secret Esther was talking about.)
:(I should investigate this so-called Sheila first.)
:'''Joanne:''' Don't wander around. You are affected by those videotapes, the consciousness disorder you're experiencing is no joke. This is the price you pay for being nosy.

;(Talk to Sheila)
:'''Sheila:''' No, Joanne, it's definitely not ordinary forgetfulness. It's like someone stole my memories overnight...
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Maybe you had a run-in with a Memosnatcher.
::'''Joanne:''' Are you talking about those radicals in the Garden of Recollection? There's nothing those guys wouldn't do to get hold of other people's memories. If this is their doing, ordinary treatment is not going to work.
::'''Joanne:''' But as far as I know, those Memosnatchers have never been seen in the space station.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} It's good to have your embarrassing memories stolen!
::'''Sheila:''' That's a good one, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}. But I am sure what I have forgotten is very important, even questions like "who am I"...
::'''Joanne:''' The way I see it, it won't matter as long as it doesn't affect your research.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have some questions that may help you remember.
::'''Joanne:''' Oh? We have a memory expert here, do we? I'd like to see what treatment you can come up with that even the medical staff don't know.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you the founder of the Dept. of Galactic Geopolitics?
:::'''Sheila:''' No, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}. I'm just a guide in the Department of Galactic Geopolitics. I'm responsible for passing on the rules made by the big shots in the space station. I'm flattered by your question though.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you ever had a lover or a husband?
:::'''Sheila:''' No, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}. I hope to contribute my everything to the Department of Galactic Geopolitics, including my health, my dreams, and my passion.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you ever left the space station?
:::'''Sheila:''' No, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}. I've never left the space station since I was born. I don't think I'll leave the space station until my soul returns to the cosmos.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The answers to these questions don't match the videos at all.
:::'''Joanne:''' So, memory expert, aren't you gonna cast your memory restoration spell? You sound like you're doing a survey. And what's with the videos?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those videos are records of Sheila's past.
::::'''Joanne:''' As far as I know, all those videos are records of someone's personal experience. You mean those videos you saw are backups of Researcher Sheila's life?
::::'''Joanne:''' Can you elaborate on what you saw?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing. I'm just talking to myself.
::::'''Joanne:''' Now you've piqued my curiosity... What exactly did you see in the videos?
:::'''Sheila:''' That's horrible. I don't remember any of these things. It's like listening to someone else's life.
:::'''Joanne:''' I'll try to sort it out for you guys. So, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|in the videos, Sheila is the founder of the Department of Galactic Geopolitics, and she left the space station and died on the way back to her home planet to warn its inhabitants about the invasion of the Legion}} &mdash; which doesn't match this person in front of us at all.
:::'''Joanne:''' Maybe it's someone with the same name?
:::'''Sheila:''' The Department of Galactic Geopolitics has registered the names of all its staff. I'm sure there's no one with the same name as me in the database.
:::'''Joanne:''' How come you remember this so well?
:::'''Sheila:''' It's very strange. There is also an image that I remember very clearly above all else.
:::'''Sheila:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Rows of security monitors}} loom within a dark room.
:::'''Sheila:''' The scene goes on forever without a beginning or an end. It is as though someone forced this image into my mind, but at the same time, it feels like a complete memory.
:::'''Sheila:''' {{MC|m=Sir|f=Ma'am}}, since fate has brought us together, I have a request. Please help me get to the place in my memories and find those security monitors.
:::'''Sheila:''' I have a hunch that if I can just find those security monitors, everything will become clear.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure, I'll help you find it.
::::'''Joanne:''' Hey, don't forget, you are both patients. One has potential short-term amnesia, and the other had a temporary disturbance of consciousness.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This sounds mysterious...
::::'''Joanne:''' What if you can't find this place at all? What if it's just your imagination?
:::'''Sheila:''' If you can't find this room at all, then maybe I am losing my mind.

:'''Gunn:''' I'm performing treatment on this young guide from the Department of Galactic Geopolitics. Do you two have a good reason for breaking in here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is a treatment?
::'''Gunn:''' There was a little accident, but nothing serious.
::'''Joanne:''' She seems to have temporarily lost consciousness, but her vitals are okay.
::'''Gunn:''' Yes, Researcher Joanne, I thought we have already reached this consensus before. Sheila will return to normal very soon, provided that you wait outside.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you have ulterior motives.
::'''Gunn:''' Look, like I said, I'm helping this guide from the Department of Galactic Geopolitics. Although there was a little accident, it was not serious and far from being a conspiracy.
::'''Joanne:''' She seems to have temporarily lost consciousness, but her vitals are okay.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm feeling a little sick, too...
::'''Gunn:''' Sorry, young one. As you can see, there was a little accident during the treatment procedure. I have to ask you to leave and wait outside for a while.
::'''Joanne:''' Okay, what are your symptoms? Let's find a place to rest and I'll take a look at you!
:'''Gunn:''' By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Gunn, the founder of the Department of Galactic Geopolitics. As you can see, I have the knowledge and authority that matches my age.
:'''Gunn:''' If you don't leave, I will have security take you away on the grounds of interfering with medical procedures.
:'''Joanne:''' There's nothing we can do... His authority is higher than mine, second only to the likes of Chief Arlan. Let's wait outside for now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you take a look at what I have here?
::'''Gunn:''' Why do you have my manuscript? I distinctly remember putting it away a long time ago.
::'''Gunn:''' It seems that you may have misunderstood its content.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's just call the Security Dept. on him now.
::'''Gunn:''' Young {{MC|m=man|f=lady}}, why would you say that? Calm down, there seems to be some misunderstanding between us.
::'''Gunn:''' Why do you have my manuscript? I distinctly remember putting it away a long time ago.
:'''Gunn:''' To tell you the truth, I'm a theater enthusiast. I've written a play or two myself in my spare time. It's pure fiction.
:'''Gunn:''' I see you have a lot of doubts about me. Why don't we have a chat. Maybe we can be friends?
:'''Joanne:''' That's right. If you have anything important to say, spill it.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} This manuscript talks about a mysterious experiment.
::'''Gunn:''' The so-called experiment is just a part of my hobby. Some people like gardening, I prefer to write plays.
::'''Gunn:''' Surely you can't be so naive as to think this has anything to do with what you see here right now, are you?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Sheila has been reciting the script you wrote in advance.
::'''Gunn:''' ...Oh, you've spoken to her. That's very observant of you. Most people wouldn't notice this without paying close attention.
::'''Gunn:''' Let me put it this way. I wrote that so-called script by imitating Sheila's speech. It is still fictional.
::'''Gunn:''' That should clear up any misunderstandings you may have.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you have ulterior motives.
::'''Gunn:''' That's just your personal speculation. Do you have any other evidence? If not, there's no need to continue this conversation.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} My intuition has always been accurate.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am not going to leave.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Joanne, don't just stand there.
::'''Joanne:''' What are you talking about... Is this another residual effect of watching those videos?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Right, the videos!
::'''Gunn:''' ...What videos? What are you talking about?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I saw you on the videos.
::'''Joanne:''' What? How could you have seen Gunn in Sheila's videos?
::'''Joanne:''' Given their age difference, if you saw a young Gunn in the videos, Sheila must've been a baby at the time &mdash; but that's not what you saw.
::'''Joanne:''' Unless, the Sheila in front of us now is neither the owner of the videos nor the real Sheila Nova.
::'''Joanne:''' If there is a so-called conspiracy or some kind of experiment, then it can only mean one thing. She is impersonating Sheila under false pretenses.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} And she is strictly following Gunn's script.
:::'''Joanne:''' Yep, it all makes sense now.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think Joanne's theory is correct.
:::'''Joanne:''' Hey, thanks for the compliment.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Unless the experiment is to keep Sheila young forever...
:::'''Joanne:''' It is said that, in the entire cosmos, only the messenger of Abundance has the power to make people live forever... Surely, Mr. Gunn doesn't have this ability.
::'''Gunn:''' Hehe, you two... I must say, this is all very entertaining to watch.
::'''Gunn:''' Well, since you've found the video... I suppose I can't hide it anymore. Who would've thought this tiny experiment of mine could attract so much interest.
::'''Gunn:''' What happens next may surprise you, but no matter what you see or hear, please be patient until the end.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't wait...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You better tell the truth. Don't embellish it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Get over yourself. There's nothing I haven't seen.
::'''Gunn:''' Sheila... reconnect. We have something to ask you.
::'''Sheila:''' Yes, Mr. Gunn... But I don't feel so good.
::'''Joanne:''' Sheila, are... are you okay?
::'''Gunn:''' Now, you can give her some instructions, like pray, sing or shout.
::'''Gunn:''' Be sure to do what I say first. Remember, the instructions include pray, sing and shout.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, pray.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, sing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, shout.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hit me...
::'''Joanne:''' Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing...
::'''Gunn:''' ...Although the instructions are not limited to the three I just mentioned, clearly this is not in the script.
::'''Gunn:''' Please do as I say.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, pray.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, sing.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila, shout.
----
:'''Joanne:''' What the heck is going on?
:'''Gunn:''' Yes, a smart person may have guessed by now...
:'''Gunn:''' This all happened because I was too idealistic with my initial experiment design &mdash; I thought I could restore Sheila to her original self relying only on a script and some technology.
:'''Gunn:''' Unfortunately, a limited script will never be able to simulate a person's natural reaction in the real world.
:'''Gunn:''' So I tried letting her watch videos from the past, hoping that she could get a better understanding of how to be human.
:'''Gunn:''' But I didn't expect Sheila, or should I say, prototype 157, to become so human.
:'''Gunn:''' She started to think more and more like a real person. She even realized that another Sheila, who looked exactly like her, once existed in this world. That was when she began to doubt her own existence.
----
:'''Gunn:''' This is very dangerous for an android.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sheila is an android!?
::'''Joanne:''' No wonder her body scan showed that her parameters were almost perfect &mdash; like a well-calibrated machine.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is an android?
::'''Joanne:''' As the name suggests, it is a robot that looks extremely similar to a real person. Now pay attention to Gunn's story and don't interrupt.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The plot thickens!
::'''Joanne:''' To be honest, it was an eye-opener for me as well. No wonder her body scan showed that her parameters were almost perfect &mdash; it was like a well-calibrated machine.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Beyond expectation, yet within reason.
::'''Joanne:''' Stop talking like an art critic!
:'''Gunn:''' That's right. The experiment I referred to is this perfect recreation of a young Sheila standing before you.
:'''Gunn:''' She was modeled after the co-founder of the Department of Galactic Geopolitics, and... the love of my life, Sheila Nova. She died in the vast ocean of stars a long time ago.
:'''Gunn:''' The reason I made prototype 157 is that I wanted to make up for my regret of not saving my true love when I had the chance.
:'''Gunn:''' When she found out that she is not a real person, in order to prevent cognitive confusion, I had to erase her memory again and again, to restore her settings and maintain her normal operation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's why Sheila had short-term amnesia.
::'''Gunn:''' Right... But I never expected she would keep asking for help from the outside world until you eventually found out about all this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But she still remembered where you hid your information.
::'''Gunn:''' I underestimated her, or rather, she has surpassed my imagination.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You shouldn't deprive her of the ability to think for herself.
::'''Gunn:''' No, I actually think this deprivation is necessary.
::'''Gunn:''' When she became aware of her own memory loss and began to ask around for help, the situation could've easily gone out of control.
:'''Gunn:''' So when I found out that Sheila was being treated by Researcher Joanne in the medical cabin, I came as soon as I could to try to "fix" her cognition once again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did this "fix" go?
::'''Gunn:''' There are many possibilities. Maybe she will finally live according to the script once and for all. Or perhaps she will continue the cycle, fall into another amnesia, and begin to seek help, until the next fix.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You won't succeed this time.
::'''Gunn:''' Indeed, I cannot let this cycle go on any longer.
:'''Gunn:''' No matter how we deal with Sheila, I beg you, please don't make this experiment public. The ethical issues are bound to be investigated by the Department of Galactic Geopolitics.
:'''Gunn:''' Please, forgive this old man who was just trying to mourn his dead wife.
:'''Joanne:''' I'm just a bystander, it's not my decision. (Trailblazer), I think you have three choices right now.
:'''Joanne:''' 1. Tell Prototype 157 the truth about her life.
:'''Joanne:''' 2. Fix and factory reset Prototype 157.
:'''Joanne:''' 3. Destroy Prototype 157 and erase all records of this dangerous experiment from the history of the space station.
:'''Joanne:''' As the leader of this investigation, it's up to you to make the final decision. As for Gunn, I'll keep an eye on him.

;(Talk to Sheila)
:'''Joanne:''' How do you feel?
:'''Sheila:''' Like I just had a very long dream.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you dream about?
::'''Sheila:''' I dreamed of a cold space station, a lost lover, a huge planet, and a silent radio.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can an android dream of electric sheep?
::'''Sheila:''' Haha, no, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}. Actually, she dreamed of a cold space station, a lost lover, a huge planet, and a silent radio.
:'''Sheila:''' So, I'm a mechanical replica... of a real person. My life is a parody of the dead.
:'''Sheila:''' My thoughts, my speech, and even my behavior are the product of Mr. Gunn's preset.
:'''Sheila:''' How ridiculous...
:'''Sheila:''' After learning that the "other me" had such a rich life, I wish I had my own birthday, my own friends and my own dreams.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take your time. Everything will happen in due course.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can inherit everything from Sheila.
:'''Sheila:''' Is it {{Color|fire|nobold=1|my wish?}} Or perhaps {{Color|fire|nobold=1|I do have my own birthday, my own friends, and my own dream}}.
:'''Joanne:''' Oh no! There seems to be a problem with her language module. Her various functional indicators are fluctuating sharply.
:'''Sheila:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer). {{Color|fire|nobold=1|I'm just a guide in the Department of Galactic Geopolitics}}. I think there is an even longer dream waiting for me. One where {{Color|fire|nobold=1|I willingly dedicate everything to the department}}.
:'''Sheila:''' Anyway, thank you and {{Color|fire|nobold=1|farewell}}, (Trailblazer).
:'''Joanne:''' Her cognitive module was burned due to information overload... It seems that telling her the truth was a bad decision.
:'''Joanne:''' Alas! Even the most advanced diagnostic equipment couldn't detect the difference between her and a real person. Except... on the side of her neck, there is a vague mark with the number 157.
:'''Joanne:''' No need to blame yourself. No one could have foreseen this outcome. It's not your fault.
:'''Joanne:''' By the way, you still have Sheila's videos there? It's time to return them to their rightful place.
:'''Joanne:''' Cheer up and let everything go back to the way it was.

;(Talk to Sheila)
:'''Joanne:''' How do you feel?
:'''Sheila:''' I feel... great. Hello, Researcher Joanne. Long time no see.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, you only just met not long ago.
::'''Sheila:''' Oh, really? I don't seem to remember anything.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please cherish how great you are feeling right now.
:'''Sheila:''' {{MC|m=Sir|f=Ma'am}}, this is the first time we've met. My name is Sheila Nova, if you want to know that.
:'''Joanne:''' Again... Endless cycle. However, her health parameters appear normal. For her, this ending may be the best outcome.
:'''Joanne:''' Such a fine piece of technological experimentation, its mere existence is a work of art. Even the most advanced diagnostic equipment couldn't detect the difference between her and a real person. Except... on the side of her neck, there is a vague mark with the number 157.
:'''Joanne:''' By the way, you still have Sheila's videos there? It's time to return them to their rightful place.
:'''Joanne:''' Just let everything go back to the way it was.

{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Joanne)
:'''Joanne:''' I wonder if Gunn will really destroy Prototype 157 as agreed?
:'''Joanne:''' Such a fine piece of technological experimentation. Even the most advanced diagnostic equipment couldn't detect the difference between her and a real person. Except... on the side of her neck, there is a vague mark with the number 157.
:'''Joanne:''' I have to say, it would be a shame if it really were destroyed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It sure is.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's a shame. No matter what, she's not a real "person."
:'''Joanne:''' ...You still have Sheila's videos there? It's time to return them to their rightful place.
