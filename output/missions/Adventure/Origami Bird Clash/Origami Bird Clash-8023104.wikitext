:'''Angry Hound:''' I was here first, woof!
:'''Irritable SoulGlad:''' Yeah, right! Ever heard of "get in line"!?
:'''Angry Hound:''' And I was here first, woof!
:'''Irritable SoulGlad:''' Shut your trap. I'm taller, so I got here first. Got it?
:You and Silver Wolf are so immersed in watching the drama that neither of you notices the rising pressure in the SoulGlad bottle...
:*POP!*
:'''Firefly:''' That was close... (Trailblazer), are you okay?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That was close... Thank you!
::'''Firefly:''' Don't mention it. I'm just glad you're okay.
::You can catch bullets with your bare hands too?
::'''Firefly:''' Um, that's a little overstating it. And what do you mean by "too"?
::What are you doing here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can catch bullets with your bare hands too?
::'''Firefly:''' Um, that's a little overstating it. And what do you mean by "too"?
::What are you doing here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you doing here?
:'''Firefly:''' I'm just looking around since I didn't have the time to do that before...
:'''Silver Wolf:''' I didn't expect to see you here. I thought you'd have had enough of the Golden Hour by now.
:'''Firefly:''' Mm-hmm, I was actually planning to go to the Moment of Oasis after wandering a little longer. I wasn't expecting to bump into the two of you &mdash; and both at the same time, too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fate brought us together!
::'''Firefly:''' Yes, I feel like we get along wonderfully too, (Trailblazer).
::Silver Wolf said she was thinking of me all the time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Silver Wolf said she was thinking of me all the time.
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Are we still talking about that!? Don't forget, I can access your account...
:'''Silver Wolf:''' That said, I'm surprised you stuck around in a place this crowded.
:'''Firefly:''' The more, the merrier, as they say. Besides, seeing everyone so chipper kind of lifts my spirits too.
:'''Firefly:''' Oh, since we've run into each other... (Trailblazer), would you like to take another photo together?
:'''Firefly:''' This place makes for a memory worth remembering. Besides, it'll be hard for us to hang out together like this again once we leave the Dreamscape...
:'''Silver Wolf:''' ...
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Chill out, you've still got plenty of time before your holiday's over. No need to take that photo right away. That said, since we've run into each other, why don't you join us for some games?
:'''Firefly:''' Games?
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Remember those arcade machines you saw on (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand)? The Family plans to develop a new game based on them.
:'''Silver Wolf:''' (Trailblazer) and I are testing the game for them now. If you don't have anything on at the moment, why not join us?
:'''Firefly:''' Uh... I'm still wanted by the Bloodhound Family, though.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll do my best to protect a pretty young lady!
:'''Firefly:''' Haha, thanks. I appreciate the gesture. Still, is it me, or have I heard that line somewhere else before...?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Translation?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did you know?
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Uh, do you have any idea how many times I've tried to convince her to game with me? Strategy, action, casual, simulation... I've suggested everything under the sun, but she never shows any interest.
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Who'd have thought this day would ever come... Tsk tsk...
:'''Firefly:''' I tried all those games that Silver Wolf mentioned, actually. But in all honesty, compared to SAM's operating system, those games are all a little... bland.
:'''Silver Wolf:''' Tsk, wish I were you. Anyway, (Trailblazer), feel free to go on ahead. I'll stay behind to teach Firefly a few tips and tricks first. The mechanics in the later stages are pretty much all the same anyway, so I'm not too keen on playing anymore.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure thing. But before that...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Check that out, Firefly!
