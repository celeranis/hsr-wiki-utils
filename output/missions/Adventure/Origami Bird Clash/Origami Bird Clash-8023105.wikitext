:'''Robin:''' When it comes to Origami Birds, there has always been an urban legend spreading around Penacony: That these cartoon characters are actually real, but can only be seen by people whom they approve of.
:'''Robin:''' Therefore, when these birds appeared before my eyes, an intense feeling of marvel welled up inside me...

:'''Robin:''' Ah... So similar...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is?
:'''Robin:''' Back when I was on a cosmic tour, a friend once gave me a children's book. The protagonist of the story was a hero without a name.
:'''Robin:''' Tasked with the duty of vanquishing the demon lord and rescuing the princess, the hero walked every corner of the land, going on adventure after adventure.
:'''Robin:''' During the journey, he occasionally encounters mischievous little sprites. They enjoy playing hide and seek, and when found, they emit a strange laughter, just like the little bird from earlier...
:'''Robin:''' Although it's a tale for children, the story is incredibly exciting and engaging. During his journey, the hero encountered so many fantastic creatures and witnessed so many unique and breathtaking places.
:'''Robin:''' He rode across fields, scaled snowy peaks, and crossed deserts, even reaching as far as the fiery core of the planet...
