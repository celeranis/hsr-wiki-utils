:{{DIcon|?}} Investigate
----
:A few wooden boxes are piled carelessly on the floor. Who knows what treasures they hold.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Open them up.
::You open the crate to find a pile of parts and steel plates.
::...Looks more like construction scrap than treasure.
::'''Benjamin:''' Oh! I see it is not just me that cares for these things.
::{{Black Screen|A man quietly walks up to your side.}}
::'''Benjamin:''' Scrap like this from construction sites will just end up being destroyed. It's such a waste!
::'''Benjamin:''' If they continue to be so wasteful with this project, it won't be long before they bust!
::'''Benjamin:''' We need to teach them how difficult it was for these materials to come by. You want to make some cash on the side?
::'''Benjamin:''' There are three other areas with crates on this site. If you can bring the items inside to me, I will reward you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why would you want scrap like this?
::'''Benjamin:''' ...One man's trash is another's treasure. Everyone knows that.
::'''Benjamin:''' Even if it's just scrap metal that's fallen from the body of the Engine of Creation, it still has cultural value! Don't you think it would be better to use them as souvenirs than cast them out as scrap?
::'''Benjamin:''' When you're done collecting them, come and find me by the equipment on the other side of the bridge. Keep your eyes peeled and make sure you're not followed.

;(Talk to Benjamin)
:'''Benjamin:''' Well, did you bring me the items?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I did.
::'''Benjamin:''' Great, great! Oh thank you! I just knew that the great and celebrated (Trailblazer) wouldn't let me down!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you planning to do with these items?
::'''Benjamin:''' I read the book on entrepreneurship that the IPC published. It says that everyone has a right to chase their dreams!
::'''Benjamin:''' When I was young, my family was poor and my parents had no money to buy me toys. Since I've grown up, I've always wanted to own a toy store and supply high-quality, cheap toys to children.
::'''Benjamin:''' So, I plan to use these materials to craft toy automatons and help Belobog in what little way I can. Now the lockdown has been lifted, I will be giving them to the children of the Underworld.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This scrap is yours.
:::'''Benjamin:''' Here is your payment. Take it. We may not see each other again for a while. The factories are busiest when they are first built.
:::{{Black Screen|Benjamin leaves happily with his goods.}}
::{{DIcon|Exit}} I need to think a little longer.
:::'''Benjamin:''' ...
:::'''Benjamin:''' You don't trust me. I can understand. I will give you time to consider.

:'''Benjamin:''' Well, did you bring me the items?
::{{DIcon|Exit}} Not yet.
::'''Benjamin:''' Ahh, you should really get a move on. Time waits for no man, you know...

;(Talk to Pela)
:'''Pela:''' Ah, (Trailblazer), have you got any new clues?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} About the Pillars of Creation construction materials...
::'''Pela:''' Yes, I'm listening.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was actually me that stole them.
:::'''Pela:''' No way. Don't make these jokes!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know who the "culprit" is!
:::'''Pela:''' You do? Tell me!
::'''Pela:''' ...
::'''Pela:''' At least that guy isn't planning to use those materials for anything crazy... It was a false alarm.
::'''Pela:''' To be on the safe side, please hand over this scrap material to us for now.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you plan on doing with this scrap?
::'''Pela:''' We will burn down and recycle this scrap in accordance with the IPC's "Environmental Protection Code." Then, they will likely be used to make things like railings and streetlamps.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This scrap is yours.
:::'''Pela:''' Thank you. I agree that this is the best solution.
