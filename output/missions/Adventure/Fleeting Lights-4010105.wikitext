:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 106.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Thank you! You're a friendly one! However, I should still explain&mdash;
:Do you have the approval of the train's owner?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 107.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Erm, that's why I'm here. Let me explain&mdash;
:Garden of Recollection? What is that?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 108.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Let me explain&mdash;
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 109.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Garden of Recollection is an organization that worships the Aeon Fuli. As a messenger for the Remembrance, we surrendered our worldly bodies and traverse the universe in the form of memes to search the stars on behalf of Fuli for the most precious memories.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 110.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Seeing that I'm able to be here, you must have already come to understand the concept of Remembrance and the Garden of Recollection. The memories that you possess have activated a pathway for the Garden of Recollection to make copies and implant me into your thoughts...
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 111.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' We can actually just follow you without being noticed. However, the Garden of Recollection believes that you're special: The memories that you possess are extremely rare and precious, and it's very likely there'll be even more in the future...
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 112.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' That's why I thought it'd be best if I introduced myself to you! I noticed that you've also received the concept of Memosnatchers... The Garden of Recollection wouldn't want you to mistake us for thieves or crooks! Everything we do is for a higher purpose.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 113.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' I believe we've become acquainted now.
:When did I come across those things before...
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 114.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Some keywords and hints to your question: Herta and Light Cone &mdash; when you came in contact with them, the concept of Remembrance, Garden of Recollection, and Memosnatcher were implanted in you.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 115.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Madam Herta has a slight prejudice against us, so the Garden of Recollection believes that it'll be best if I provide you with a proper understanding of these concepts.
:What is your noble cause?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 116.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' We want to prevent the universe from being forgotten because of the Destruction.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 117.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Even if all matter is annihilated, it can continue to live on in the form of memories.
:So you're just smuggling yourself on board the express?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 118.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' There's a big difference, of course. I don't have a material body, so it doesn't count as smuggling.
:So, you're a... 2D character?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 119.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Yup, just imagine me as someone from the posters. It would be strange if you were to scold someone from the cartoons for smuggling, right?
:So, you're a... burglar of physical bodies?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 120.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Why would I want to steal a material body? I gave up my own willingly!
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 121 f.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' There is actually something that I need. So I'll get right to it. (Trailblazer), the Garden of Recollection wants to preserve your memories.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 122.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' But don't worry, we won't take it from you. We just want to make a copy of the precious moments. You can see it as a trade between us...
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 123.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' This is the Forgotten Hall created specially to store your memories. We hope that you can visit this place regularly to rekindle your lost memories. The Garden of Recollection will extract the memories they want and give you something in return &mdash; in the form of matter and Light Cones.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 124.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Come, I swear on the memories of my past self that you won't be at a loss for anything.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 125.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' What is it? Are you not feeling well?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think I'm used to this...
::{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 126.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' That's how it is the first time.
::It's nothing, I feel fine.
::{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 127.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Ah, that's good. I was afraid you'd be angry.
::Why do we still have to fight inside?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's nothing, I feel fine.
::{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 127.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Ah, that's good. I was afraid you'd be angry.
::Why do we still have to fight inside?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do we still have to fight inside?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 128.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' A strong stimulus will lower your guard against your subconscious. Only then will we be able to copy your memories.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 129.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' From now on, all you have to do is enter the Forgotten Hall periodically, and we'll give you an abundant amount of rewards.
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 130.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Erm, about me being on the Astral Express... It'd be best if you kept it between the two of us. I won't reveal myself to your companions, so make sure you don't tell them about me, okay?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, I have to tell them.
::{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 131.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' If that's the case, the Garden of Recollection will have to block out their memories... I really don't have a choice, please don't make me do that!
::This is our little secret.
::{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 132 m.ogg}} {{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 132 f.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Perfect! Thank you, (Trailblazer). I'm glad you're so pleasant to work with.
::Then what should I tell everyone?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then what should I tell everyone?
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 133.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Erm, you can say that it's just a Phase Flame or an Inquisition Spirit. They often suddenly appear and then vanish. You should be able to get past them with that...
:{{A|VO SideX sys1 messenger 134.ogg}} '''Messenger:''' Alrighty then, just step close to the mirror if you ever want to find me.
