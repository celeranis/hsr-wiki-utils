;(Talk to Tantan)
:'''Tantan:''' I'm always ready to assuage the public's doubts. That's part of my duty as a speed tester at the Sky-Faring Commission as well. Just ask away.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What do speed testers usually do?
::'''Tantan:''' Mmm? Are you interested in my everyday work?
::'''Tantan:''' My everyday job is pretty boring. I just stand here and measure the speeds of every starskiff going past. If I catch anyone speeding, I stop them and firmly educate them about the law.
::'''Tantan:''' This job may be boring, but it's extremely important. Every year, many Xianzhou natives die a premature death due to dangerous driving &mdash; despite their natural longevity.
::'''Tantan:''' But no matter how boring the job might be, the fulfillment alone can still be more enjoyable than just lazily sleeping in on the weekends. Wouldn't you say so?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do many people speed?
::'''Tantan:''' Actually, Xianzhou natives are relatively decent at driving... ahem, no offense intended. People here can live a very long life and are relatively calm, so they don't drive too fast.
::'''Tantan:''' But there are also some long-life species that don't obey the speed limit. They feel like they've lived for so long that nothing could possibly happen to them, so they speed like crazy in their starskiffs... resulting in rather... uh, unfortunate situations.
::'''Tantan:''' I've been thinking &mdash; how about I give a professional lecture about traffic safety for the public?
::'''Tantan:''' I've come up with a name for it already: ''Tantan's Tenet''! Or ''In Tandem With Tantan''. What do you think?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A bit of a tongue-twister...
:::'''Tantan:''' Hmm... you're not wrong. Maybe there are other names that could roll off the tongue a little easier.
:::'''Tantan:''' Since my name's Tantan and it's a lecture about traffic safety, why don't I call it...
:::'''Tantan:''' ''Traffic Safety with Tantan''! Ah, it's perfect. Once I get some free time, I'll report back to the Sky-Faring Commission and put in a submission for it...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps it could be a bit more straightforward?
:::'''Tantan:''' Makes sense... more straightforward... got it!
:::'''Tantan:''' Since my name's Tantan and it's a lecture about traffic safety, why don't I call it...
:::'''Tantan:''' ''Traffic Safety with Tantan''! Ah, it's perfect. Once I get some free time, I'll report back to the Sky-Faring Commission and put in a submission for it...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you get very busy at work?
::'''Tantan:''' Way too busy. It's one thing to measure every starskiff's speed, but it's another to count the number of starskiffs in rush-hour traffic. And I have to enforce the law for each case... like I am right now. It's just another thing to do. My job is never done.
::'''Tantan:''' Sometimes, things get really complicated... like a hit-and-run during rush-hour traffic... If only I have a clone to get everything done. As much as I love this job, it's sometimes just too hard to handle.
::'''Tantan:''' That's why I've found a few traffic volunteers to help me out here. Say, if you've got the spare time, would you like to contribute to the peace and order aboard Xianzhou? Naturally, it's just a volunteer position but I won't be sending you home empty-handed.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Does it get very dangerous?
::'''Tantan:''' In law enforcement circles, my job is pretty safe. There's no violent crime, and no truly bad crooks...
::'''Tantan:''' If there's a hit-and-run, I'll give chase in my starskiff. I guess if you call that dangerous, then that's as dangerous as it gets.
::'''Tantan:''' Judging by your appearance, you're no ordinary citizen. Haha, I bet my sense of "danger" doesn't really sound like much to you.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I have nothing else...
::'''Tantan:''' So long then~ Take care driving out there, and pay attention to the traffic! ...Oh yeah, if you do ever want to be a traffic volunteer, come find me.

===Head to the Starskiff Haven docks and explain the situation to Luhui{{subst:void|<!--202030207-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Mei's been carted off by the Alchemy Commission apothecary paramedics and Luhui, who only just got the news, rushed over from work to Starskiff Haven. Luhui wants to meet with you again to express her thanks.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Luhui)
:'''Luhui:''' Are you (Trailblazer)? The person who contacted me? Has Mei already left Starskiff Haven?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The healers had already taken her away.
::'''Luhui:''' No worries. My schedule shouldn't hold up her treatment. I will visit the Alchemy Commission later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should head to the Alchemy Commission apothecary straight away.
::'''Luhui:''' No rush. Mei should get treated first, and I should meet you in person.
:'''Luhui:''' I bought some Xianzhou snacks on the way here as a small thank-you present. Please, take them. Thank you so much for all you've done for a complete stranger.
:'''Luhui:''' So... can you tell me what happened here?
:{{Black Screen|While enjoying the Xianzhou snacks Luhui brought, you recount the incident in detail...}}
:'''Luhui:''' ...I see. She doesn't use the jade abacus and has no relatives, so I'm the right person for you to contact. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have known about this.
:'''Luhui:''' Mei doesn't have a family. She has been working as a housekeeper for a long time, and I'm her current employer.
:'''Luhui:''' Mei might not be the brightest and may even be slightly dense in the head. She's good at manual labor, but memory is not her forte. She keeps getting the wrong groceries.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mei does seem a little dense.
::'''Luhui:''' Is it that obvious? For me, having her around day and night does make me more aware of her struggles.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She doesn't seem like a mentally challenged person.
::'''Luhui:''' You probably won't feel it from a quick chat. Having her around day and night does make me more aware of her struggles.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you bad-mouthing Mei?
::'''Luhui:''' I'm not bad-mouthing her. I'm just concerned for her.
:'''Luhui:''' Sometimes she can't even communicate on a basic level, and I would have to repeat the same sentence a few times before she understood it. Being the way she is, she won't be able to handle the compensation on her own after getting into an accident like this.
:'''Luhui:''' I'll need to settle the compensation for her. If this were left to her alone, it would just fizzle out in the end.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You treat your housekeeper so well.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you really not family?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should I anticipate a plot twist right about now?
:'''Luhui:''' ...
:'''Luhui:''' To be honest, I originally wanted to dismiss her today. It had been on my mind for a long while. If it weren't for this accident...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...You can't kick her when she's down.
::'''Luhui:''' That's right. This is not the right time to do so.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is a good chance to do so.
::'''Luhui:''' Please don't tease me.
:'''Luhui:''' Actually, I wasn't super satisfied when I hired her. I only hired her because her asking price was low, for one. After learning about her experience, I also thought I'd give her a try as an act of charity.
:'''Luhui:''' Her memory and hearing impairment aside, she's rather simple-minded and has difficulty distinguishing between praises and admonishments.
:'''Luhui:''' Sometimes I get so upset and scold her, but she always laughs it off. The words just go into one ear and out of the other for her, and she eventually repeats the same mistakes, which makes me even more upset... I can't stand this vicious cycle anymore.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So why didn't you lay her off earlier?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not that bad. No need to fire her.
::'''Luhui:''' I'm only an average citizen who wants better housekeeping service. I just want to get a new housekeeper like everyone else, someone I can have an easier time communicating with. That's not asking too much, is it?
:'''Luhui:''' I have tried so many times over the years to change her out for a different housekeeper, but I just couldn't let go of her affordability, and sometimes I feel it's just too much of a hassle to make the change.
:'''Luhui:''' But most of the time, I feel someone like Mei would not be hired anywhere else. If I dismissed her, she would have no one to turn to. She might even struggle just to stay alive.
:'''Luhui:''' I want to handle Mei's compensation for her before having a talk with her. Hopefully, by that point, I'll still have the same resolve as I do today. Oh, right. You seem like someone who's knowledgeable about many things. Do you have any good suggestions on how to handle this?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you should fire her.
::'''Luhui:''' Hmm, I will take that into consideration. After all, the employment relationship is an exchange of equivalents, and feelings have nothing to do with it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I would suggest that you don't fire her.
::'''Luhui:''' Is that so? I will take that into consideration. I guess I will stay in this dilemma for a while longer.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm really bad at giving advice.
::'''Luhui:''' No worries, I've already troubled you so much. I should sort this out on my own.
:'''Luhui:''' Don't let me take any more of your time. I need to head toward the Alchemy Commission apothecary. Let's catch up later. Thank you for your effort.

:::'''Tantan:''' She heard the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|sound of the engine of the starskiff that had caused the accident. It was loud and different from ordinary starskiffs.}}
:::'''Tantan:''' This may be because that starskiff has been illegally modified. There are some people who like to install military-grade engines starskiffs onto civilian starskiffs, resulting in a large sound when driving... In essence, this testimony is of great value.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} The suddenly excited man's testimony.
:::'''Tantan:''' He chased the offending starskiff to the crossroad and saw it {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|make a right turn there!}}
:::'''Tantan:''' We chased it from north to south. Making a right turn means that it went to the west.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Mei's testimony.
:::'''Tantan:''' Mei's memory is not very good. I asked her several times. She said the color of that starskiff looks like {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|blue}}, but it could also be {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|yellow}}, or maybe neither.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ms. Luhui can finish them alone, right?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you worried that Luhui is going to hire someone else?

:'''Luhui:''' Okay... What are these squares over here?
:'''Mei:''' The dishcloth is placed in this cabinet. As for the cloth for wiping the table, I put it on the second cabinet door in the kitchen, and the kitchen clothes are placed separately...
:'''Mei:''' Look at this page. It has all the names of the foodstuffs that the baby hates to eat written on it. He won't eat these, even if you cut them into pieces. These are the meals I planned that will guarantee a superb supply of nutrition. You love spicy food, but don't eat too much or you will get a heartburn...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is really detailed.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So this is the note that Mei wants to retrieve.

:'''Luhui:''' In the "Water the Flowers" section, you drew a glass that is one-third full of water. What does this mean? Is this the amount of water you use to water the flowers each time?
:'''Mei:''' No. It's the amount of nutrient solution that must be used when watering flowers. Ms. Luhui said that every time the amount must be just right, it can't be too much or too little.
:'''Luhui:''' I forgot about this myself...
:'''Luhui:''' What is this page about? "A kind young {{MC|f=lady|m=man}} helped me find the notebook. Must thank {{MC|f=her|m=him}}."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's me!

:'''Luhui:''' (Trailblazer), I just realized that Mei is not worried about losing her job.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She is worried that no one can take care of you after she is gone.
::'''Luhui:''' Yes, she is worried about me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So what is she worried about?
::'''Luhui:''' She is worried that no one can take care of me after she is gone.
:'''Luhui:''' I've always thought of Mei as an incompetent worker. But in Mei's heart, I'm a family member she has to take care of... *sigh*
:'''Luhui:''' You've heard me complain about Mei many times. I didn't know that I was not a good employer until I saw her notebook. She has written down so many things that I said.
:'''Luhui:''' Considering Mei's slowness, I have no qualms about paying her well below the market average. When I'm in a bad mood, I always get mad at her and set a lot of "rules" for her, and she wrote them all down without complaint.
:'''Luhui:''' After looking at the notes, I realized that she has taken care of me for two hundred years.
:'''Luhui:''' Two hundred years must be a long time for Outworlders, and it's also quite a long time for me. Why did I take everything for granted?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because Mei is just like family to you.
::'''Luhui:''' You're right. She's like family. That's why I took her for granted.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So Xianzhou has no popular stories about the old and the helpless?
::'''Luhui:''' Why would you ask this? There are no old people on Xianzhou...
::'''Luhui:''' You mean people on Xianzhou don't age like Outworlders, so they aren't afraid of getting old and ending up living on the streets?
::'''Luhui:''' What an odd but reasonable point of view. Mei won't age, and neither will I. I was not aware of Mei's hardship, nor was she aware of it.
::'''Luhui:''' If you think about it, not being able to age has its downsides too, huh...
:'''Luhui:''' By the way, I asked you twice before and was hoping for your advice. In an employer-employee relationship, should I think of Mei as an hourly paid housemaid, or as a family member who has been there with me for a long time?
:'''Luhui:''' But this time I don't need to ask anymore. I already have the answer myself.
:'''Luhui:''' I'll stay here for a while. I should stop bothering you now. Have a nice day.
