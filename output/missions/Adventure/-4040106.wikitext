:If High Morals were a real person, it'd probably be frowning so hard at you right now.
:But one thing at a time, you will have nothing to worry about when you consume a "Praise of High Morals" to open this suspicious suitcase. So, go ahead!
:<!--1-second delay-->
:You finally locate the source of that ticking sound in the rather empty suitcase. It turns out to be a precious gold watch!
:The moniker "Wallace" is engraved on the watch, along with the line, "Should this item come into your possession, kindly contact Wallace Cambridge Limestein. Your act of kindness shall be handsomely recompensed."
:This watch seems destined to be here at this very moment, as its wealthy owner has already made preparations for all the foreseeable fates of this watch, with the possible exception that it might be mistaken for a bomb.
