:'''Pela:''' Alright, Mr. Researcher... Do you want to comment on this? Your statement seems to be a little bit different from this {{MC|m=gentleman|f=lady}}'s.
:'''Researcher:''' Well... I was just afraid you'd make Molly a suspect. She can be a bit impatient at times, but I assure you that this incident has nothing to do with her! Please just spare me, Captain...
:'''Pela:''' Don't worry, you and Molly will be fine. Just don't play silly games with me when it happens again in the future. Remember what I said? Don't waste my time!
:'''Researcher:''' Oh... Thank you... thank you so much Captain Sergekevna!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Her name is Pelageya Sergey...
::'''Pela:''' ...Well, whatever. I've gotten used to it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So what are you going to do next?
:'''Pela:''' Even though I really want to hold you responsible for your trespassing into the military zone, I will however let it slide this time, since Serval vouched for your ability and character. I would also like to ask you to help me deal with the incident, which is a chance for you to make up for your mistakes.
:'''Pela:''' Long story short, this robot incident is just one chapter in my ongoing investigation. The stakes here are very high, and Miss Molly may have ruffled some feathers.
:'''Pela:''' So... she might be in danger now...
:'''Pela:''' I am going to ask you one last question: Do you know where Molly is?
:'''Researcher:''' Well... There seemed to be a family emergency, so she ran back to check on them. It was a Silvermane Guard from the Garrison who came to send her the message. I don't know what they talked about, but she looked dreadful afterwards.
:'''Researcher:''' I think... you can go to the Administrative District. There is an apartment building next to the abandoned business street. I think Molly is there.
:'''Pela:''' ...I guess I was right. She's in trouble.
:'''Pela:''' I'll go first. Please follow me as soon as possible.

:'''Molly:''' *sigh*
:'''Pela:''' You must be Molly from the Technology Division. How are things going?
:'''Molly:''' Leave me alone! So annoying!
:'''Molly:''' Huh? Oh, you're Officer Pela... I'm sorry, I&mdash;I'm in the middle of an emergency... I am very sorry!
:'''Molly:''' Ah, you're here as well, I see... Have those defective robots been dealt with?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} All done. No one was hurt.
::'''Molly:''' That's good...
::'''Molly:''' No, wait. Why should it have anything to do with me? All I ended up doing was just cleaning up the mess left behind by those guys... Why should I worry so much for them? It's not like it's my fault!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did anyone in your family get hurt?
::'''Molly:''' ... Forget it. Why do I care whether they live or die?
::'''Molly:''' Family? Oh, is this what you two are here for? Fortunately, I live alone, and no one else got hurt.
::'''Molly:''' I was waiting for your update at the arsenal just now, and those people came to me. They said that I went too far this time, so they gave me a warning... I realized something was wrong, so I ran home as fast as I could &mdash;
::'''Molly:''' By the time I got home, the whole house had been turned upside down by them! All the valuables, and even the worthless stuff are gone... Everything. Gone. They took everything!
::'''Molly:''' They even wrote insults all over the doors, windows, and walls &mdash;
::'''Molly:''' But I can't do anything about it! Am I supposed to just let them get away with it... Can't anyone hold them accountable for their actions?
::'''Molly:''' Why... I was just doing my job! Why do I have to be humiliated? What did I do wrong!?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Let her cry and vent.)
:::'''Molly:''' Darn it! Is there no justice in this world? *sobbing*...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We'll help you take back what is rightfully yours.
:::'''Molly:''' This happened all because of me. You don't have to do that... I just need to blow off some steam...
:::'''Pela:''' Don't be afraid, Miss Molly... This isn't your fault. Just let us handle this from now on. We the Silvermane Guards are now officially on this case. For now, it's best for you not to directly confront those thugs since they've just shown they are not shy about using violence.
:::'''Pela:''' Oh, another thing, you can rest assured that we the Silvermane Guards will never let you go homeless. You can... um... seek temporary shelter in the Neverwinter workshop for now.
:::'''Pela:''' The owner of the workshop can ensure your safety. Just say my name when you meet her.
:::'''Molly:''' ... But I want to go with you! I want to see those gang of thugs brought to justice with my own eyes...
:::'''Pela:''' ...It's just too risky. Your security must be our top priority. I'll arrange to have your house fixed later. For the time being, please just focus on protecting yourself in case of further reprisals.
:::'''Molly:''' *sobbing*
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' (She still seems very upset...)
:::<!--0.3-second delay-->
:::'''Pela:''' (Trailblazer), I already know the people responsible for this... their names are all in my records. They won't get away.
:::'''Pela:''' Now, let's go back to the Restricted Zone and give those filthy thugs a proper "greeting."

:'''Molly:''' Indeed, and I found it! And luckily it's still in good condition...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good to hear!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's this?
::'''Molly:''' Oh... This is a family heirloom. Even though I don't know exactly what's inside, it's still very important to me.
:'''Pela:''' Miss Molly, I do have another very serious question to ask you... How did you manage to show up before we did? If anything, you should be at the workshop now.
:'''Molly:''' Well... I...
:'''Molly:''' I was thinking about how all this only happened because of me, so... I thought I should...
:'''Pela:''' That is not a good excuse, Miss Molly. No offense, but you were simply too reckless.
:'''Pela:''' I do admire your bravery and sense of duty... but you're still lacking in situational judgment and thus often end up putting yourself in harm's way.
:'''Pela:''' Have you really given much thought to how you could win the fight against those thugs all on your own? Let's be charitable here and assume you could beat them. What then? Are you really equipped to take on the criminal mastermind behind the scenes?
:'''Molly:''' ...
:'''Molly:''' *sigh* You are right, Officer Pela. I didn't think carefully enough about the consequences of my action. And those goons weren't entirely off the mark when they said I couldn't take on the whole world just on my own.
:'''Molly:''' I thought I could make Belobog a better place... Well, I can't even manage my own life...
:'''Molly:''' I've been working so hard... but what's the point?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's indeed all for naught.

:'''Pela:''' Well... Molly, please don't get nihilistic... Maybe I was being a bit too harsh just now. I didn't mean to upset you...
:'''Molly:''' ...Sorry, I'm fine. I just couldn't help myself. I'd better listen to Officer Pela and head back to the workshop...
