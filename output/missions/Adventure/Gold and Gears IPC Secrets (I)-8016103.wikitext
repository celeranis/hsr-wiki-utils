:'''Herta:''' What do you think, (Trailblazer)? The Simulated Universe is pretty fun, no?
:'''Herta:''' An idea hit me while you were exploring, so I immediately went for it. I decided to share my insights about the Simulated Universe with my sidekick here while I waited for you.
:'''Herta:''' We made a bet about Rubert the emperor. Historically, Rubert was destroyed and the Machine Empire collapsed. Some purport that Rubert was killed by an IPC assassin, and some claim that it was smashed up by the Lord of Silence.
:'''Herta:''' Which version is the truth? I believe it was Polka Kakamond who did it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are the stakes for the bet?
:'''Little Robot:''' I think the first version has a possibility to be true. The IPC would fight Rubert I to the death.
:'''Herta:''' We'll see. If I win, the sidekick will come clean with the Strategic Investment Department's purpose behind this trip &mdash; even though I'm not really interested.
:'''Herta:''' Otherwise, I'll transfer the ownership of the Simulated Universe to the IPC.
:'''Herta:''' There's no way I'll lose by choosing the Lord of Silence! By the way, please don't tell Ruan Mei and Screwllum about this bet.
