:This looks like the last one. Belobog's cityscape has been completely revitalized thanks to you. Congratulations!
:You count and find seven Wanted posters in total &mdash; but unfortunately, despite collecting all seven of these, no Supreme Guardian pops out of nowhere to grant fulfillment of your wishes.
:That's all there is regarding these Wanted posters. But if you're still curious, you might be able to hit up some of your Silvermane Guard friends &mdash;
:Gepard and Pela &mdash; you can ask them why these Wanted posters are so strange.
