:'''Herta:''' The official version of "Simulated Universe"! Forget about the previous beta version. There are lots of changes. Do you want me to give you the patch notes?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just say them out loud to me.
::'''Herta:''' You have zero manners...
::'''Herta:''' Firstly, Stephen has made significant adjustments to the gameplay loop. According to him, "The challenge goal of each phase is even clearer" &mdash; I don't really get it. Just because I'm a genius doesn't mean I understand gaming &mdash; so whatever he says goes.
::'''Herta:''' This version offers a higher degree of freedom. You can mix and match your team, choose from a variety of Blessings, and there are even random events to guarantee you a unique experience every time.
::'''Herta:''' Finally, there's a new mechanic that helps you to better pretend to be Akivili.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll figure it out myself.
::'''Herta:''' Alright, stay curious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nah, I'm not interested.
::'''Herta:''' Alright. You'll find out soon enough.

;(Talk to Occurrence)
:'''Simulated Universe:''' You see a man about thirty years old with an unremarkable appearance, wearing a white shirt and brown suspenders. His eyes wander while he speaks, as if avoiding something. "Uh, I wanted to add some random occurrences to this game to make it more fun... But I think the brainwave reader is on the fritz. So, uh, now the events you encounter will be a little more, uh, monotonous. Sorry about that."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you talking about?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How bland will they be?
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Like," he stutters without looking at you, "like, uh, this is a random Occurrence now. I wrote some templates, but the simulation currently doesn't have any way of converting them into content. So, you will just see the following..."
:'''Simulated Universe:''' After speaking, the man disappears, and a line of words materializes where he was standing: You have encountered a {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|random Occurrence}}.
:{{DIcon|Star}} undefined &mdash; undefined
:;(Obtain {{Item|Cosmic Fragment|20|x=150}})
:{{DIcon|Star}} undefined &mdash; undefined
:;(Obtain a Blessing [100410])
:{{DIcon|Star}} undefined &mdash; undefined
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Uh, yeah, that's how monotonous." The man says as if he is genuinely sorry.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright, I understand.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A borderline acceptable solution.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} When will it be fixed?
:'''Simulated Universe:''' "Hopefully very soon," the man says earnestly. "I really want you to have a good time, really. Um, once again, I'm really sorry about that."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Finish.

:'''Herta:''' How's your experience with the official version? If you find it easy, you can go challenge the next world.
:'''Herta:''' Apparently it's more difficult with stronger enemies. Screwllum said that, according to his model, you have a 60% chance of losing the first time, but it's not like you'll actually lose anything.
:'''Herta:''' You'll clear it sooner or later.
