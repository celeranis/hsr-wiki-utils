{{Stub Dialogue}}
:An insect passing by blocks your path. You notice a faint sound coming out from its mandibles...
:"Save me!" Is this insect asking for help? Obviously not. So, who could this be? You start to ponder deeply...
:The insect notices you!
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Uh, I'm feeling a little dizzy. Sorry... Are you the one who just saved me?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe.
::'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' It's just you and me here. It has to be you.
::That's right. I'm the one!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right. I'm the one!
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Thank you, good-hearted stranger.
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' ...I feel sick.
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Er, I didn't mean I'm sick of you. I was stuck in that bug's stomach for ages and I still reek of gastric juices. So, so gross...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Were you gobbled up by an insect?
::'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Pretty much. But also not quite right, because that bug didn't even bother to chew me up before swallowing me down its belly.
::How'd you avoid getting digested?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How'd you avoid getting digested?
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Well... I think it's something to do with the stuffing ingredients on my head. Basically, the monster seems to be slightly allergic to me and so it can't digest my skin.
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Dizzy... I'm so dizzy. I feel sick...
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Sorry, I'm filthy. I need to find a place to wash up. Here's a little something for you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Point out the way home for it)
:'''Ruan Mei's Pitiable Creation:''' Wow, I won't have to keep stumbling around! Thank you, {{MC|f=lovely miss|m=good sir}}.
