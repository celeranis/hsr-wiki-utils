:'''(Trailblazer):''' (She doesn't seem to have any desire whatsoever to attack. Perhaps I can avoid a tough fight?)
:'''Guardian Shadow:''' ...Who are you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Are you talking to me?
::'''Guardian Shadow:''' You... are you real?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do I still have to fight?
::'''Guardian Shadow:''' I don't... want to hurt... anyone...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm a goner...
::'''Guardian Shadow:''' I... don't mean... trouble...
:'''Guardian Shadow:''' I haven't seen a... stranger in a long, long time.
:'''Guardian Shadow:''' Mr. Stefan is gone... they've all gone. Everyone.
:'''Guardian Shadow:''' The people I trusted... the people I was close to... they've all left me. This city... has abandoned me.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Stefan? I remember that name.)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Could she be...)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that you, Cyrille?
:'''Cyrille:''' ...
:'''Cyrille:''' Do you know me... stranger?
:'''Cyrille:''' You... Did Mr. Stefan send you to meet me?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (lying) Yes! He told me to come and save you.
::'''Cyrille:''' N&mdash;No. You don't have... his scent.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I don't know him.
::'''Cyrille:''' Oh... that's okay. I can feel it too... You really don't have his scent on you at all.
:'''Cyrille:''' ...Nobody is coming here for me anymore. I'm not smart enough, not strong enough, not independent enough... but I know all that. I've been lying to myself all this time and living that way for so long... I'm so tired of it.
:'''Cyrille:''' You... stranger, I don't understand... How do you know my name?
:'''Cyrille:''' ...Never mind. I don't want to get into it any further... too much questioning will only lead to more pain. It's always been the case...
:'''Cyrille:''' You're my only witness... the final witness. That fact alone is comforting enough... knowing that I don't have to wander around in eternal loneliness...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What can I do for you?
::'''Cyrille:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you thinking about right now?
::'''Cyrille:''' I... have a favor to ask.
:'''Cyrille:''' I want to know... why my fate is like this. I guess the answer is sealed in here, but there's nothing I can do about it...
:'''Cyrille:''' Will you help me, stranger? If you can help me find the answer... I'll tell you everything there is about me. No secrets.
:'''Cyrille:''' My story... may not be that interesting, but perhaps you'd like to hear it, right? I hope you do...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll help you... I want to hear your story.
::'''Cyrille:''' Thank you. I was afraid... that you'd say no.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If I say no...
::'''Cyrille:''' ...I was afraid you'd say that, but... I can't force you. I would never force anyone to do anything.
::'''Cyrille:''' Maybe I just have to keep waiting around. Wait for the next witness, who'll probably never come...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry... I'll help you out.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll help you, even if it's just out of sympathy.
:::'''Cyrille:''' Really? Thank you...
:'''Cyrille:''' I got no place to go. I'll be waiting for you here.
:'''Cyrille:''' If you want to give up, that's okay... I'm just a shadow, and I'm not able to begrudge anyone, even if they trick me... And I don't feel sad either.

:'''Cyrille's Echo:''' I'm sorry. Mr. Stefan... I'm not... who you're looking for...
:Cyrille's echoes dissipate amidst the howling of the icy wind.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pick up Cyrille's relic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Should I even touch this?
:;(Screen fades to black)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (It shouldn't be a big deal. It's only reasonable to take home some rewards for finishing all these missions.)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (So Cyrille was actually a Supreme Guardian... how unbelievable.)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (How can these echoes of hers be so powerful that they took on human form in the Fragmentum? And why was it accompanied by all those weird box puzzles...?)

::'''Agnes:''' What do you think? Doesn't this description give you an appetite?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Are you asking me?
:::'''Agnes:''' Yeah, do you see anyone else?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Maybe?
:::'''Agnes:''' You don't sound so convinced. I understand, you are saying "No."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a chance.
:::'''Agnes:''' Well, I can't blame you &mdash; it's my own problem. My writing is not good enough.
::'''Agnes:''' Darn it. What's the point of being a food journalist if I can't use words to construct a sense of taste and utilize synesthesia? By the way, while I'm talking with you, I have another paragraph here. Let me read it to you.
::'''Agnes:''' "The rich sauces are like an invading army, completely overwhelming the crisp and fresh taste of the salmon. The gentle aroma of fish has no choice but to surrender in defeat..."
::'''Agnes:''' How's that feel? A little too wordy?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should write a novel.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, a lot of unnecessary details.
::'''Agnes:''' I can't help myself, I used to be a literary journalist. Every day I was trying to add more adjectives to the sentence anywhere I could fit them. I wouldn't get my bonus if readers can easily deduce the subject, predicate, and object within three lines.
::'''Agnes:''' But then a new girl came and was better at filling in words than I was, so I made a career change. Have you read the cuisine section of the ''Crystal Daily''? I am the author of that section.
::'''Agnes:''' Honestly, I don't want to include all that garish garbage in my writing anyway...
::'''Agnes:''' I'm gonna put more work into honing my rhetorical skills. Well, enough about me &mdash; how can I help you?

;(Unused &mdash; Wait_Option_5010271_18)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I ask a question...?
::'''Chavez:''' Go ahead! It's our responsibility to help prevent the public from being scammed.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...the Dark-Blue Scam Victims Association?
:::'''Chavez:''' That's right! The members of the Association are all former victims. We are united to share what we have learned and help the public by raising awareness!
:::'''Chavez:''' The guide goes over case studies of those who were scammed by the blue-haired swindler. It is evidence of his evil crimes, a painful lesson that we predecessors suffered.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...How were you scammed?
:::'''Chavez:''' The first time I met that guy, he asked if I wanted a "parallel universe printer."
:::'''Chavez:''' Well, I asked him how the printer works... and he immediately started rambling on a bunch of smorgasbord about science stuff. I was almost caught up in it.
:::'''Chavez:''' Terms like parallel universe, Aeons, and parity anomaly... Swindlers love to use these words related to the universe and Aeons to scam people!
:::'''Chavez:''' I didn't believe him until he used it to print money. He made two bills with the exact same serial number...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much did you pay?
::::'''Chavez:''' Uh... the price isn't important. What's important is that you need to be careful, so the same scam doesn't happen to you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did the printer work?
::::'''Chavez:''' Of course not, otherwise why do you think I would have joined the association?
:::'''Chavez:''' Ahem, sometime later, after the counterfeiting scam, I bumped into that same blue-haired guy again in an alley in the Commercial District.
:::'''Chavez:''' I should have had the Silvermane Guards arrest him, but I was so angry and I needed an explanation...
:::'''Chavez:''' Instead, he asked me with a straight face, "Were you staring at the printer?"
:::'''Chavez:''' He accused me of not reading the manual and wasting such a genius invention. He even offered to refund the full payment so that he could find another buyer for the parallel universe printer.
:::'''Chavez:''' He also said, "If the operator keeps staring at the printer, the parallel universe transmission can't happen. The only way to avoid interfering with the transmission process is to observe it with the help of an aether lens."
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...So you bought an aether lens?
:::'''Chavez:''' Doesn't that sound reasonable? So I was tricked again by his apparent sincerity...
:::'''Chavez:''' Now I know that nine out of ten people who try to associate their products with any kind of parallel universe theory are scammers!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Parallel universes actually exist.
::::'''Chavez:''' Haha, are you kidding me? Do you really expect me to believe that?
::::'''Chavez:''' Or... are you working with the blue-haired guy?
::::'''Chavez:''' Get out! If you don't leave, I'll have Silvermane Guards come and arrest you!

;(Talk to Dominic)
:'''Dominic:''' Normal it is, for you to have doubts in your hearts &mdash; because you look around yourselves, and you can't SEE Preservation anywhere; you cast your eyes hither and thither, and nary do you see ANY evidence of the very existence of Preservation.
:'''Dominic:''' ...And yet comes this very day, I shall resolve your doubts and let you feel the true grace of Preservation, let you marvel at the almighty will of the Architects...
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Keep listening...
::'''Dominic:''' ...Preservation is the embodiment of Qlipoth, and is with us all the time. It's the secret force that imperceptibly shapes our personalities, impacting all the important decisions that we make during our lives...
::'''Dominic:''' ...The reason why you struggle so to find it, is because Preservation's grace is integrated with the world we know, diffused throughout the air we breathe, refracted through the light we see. It has gently embraced us in its bosom since the very dawn of our existence.
::'''Dominic:''' The Admonishments of the Supreme Guardian remind us to never take Preservation's grace for granted! We must inherit the spirit of our Architect ancestors: To persevere and survive in this world of ours, and to bravely defy any calamities we face!
::'''Dominic:''' The Fragmentum and the Eternal Freeze &mdash; These are just bumps in the road on the path to carrying out the will of Preservation! O brothers and sisters, stand together with thine Architects and our Supreme Guardian! Follow in her footsteps &mdash; for victory is our destiny!

:{{DIcon|Talk}} You seem upset.
::'''Furdo:''' Huh? Is it that obvious?
::'''Furdo:''' Dealing with a bunch of ignorant old people, every day &mdash; you would be annoyed too if you were me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of legal issues do you help them with?
::'''Furdo:''' Legal issues? You think too highly of the people of Belobog. What they come to me for has nothing to do with the law. It's all complaints about daily life.
::'''Furdo:''' It's always the same thing. The complainant tells me they have been altruistic and taken the big picture into consideration and the offending party has taken advantage of them and is being ungrateful.
::'''Furdo:''' You can hear thousands of stories like this at Solwarm Festival family gatherings. Those stories are, in the end, moral blackmail, which I'm not interested in at all.
::'''Furdo:''' But I am a legal practitioner after all, so it is my duty to help the public get to know the law. Every time it gets to this part, they start to pretend like they don't understand me.
::'''Furdo:''' But who's to blame? After all, the law is always fair and impartial, showing favor to no one?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you rich?
::'''Wallace:''' Oh, I wouldn't say I'm rich. I'm... comfortable.
::'''Wallace:''' I have a couple of properties in the Administrative District that require maintenance. I have to pay taxes for them. But I'm far too lazy to rent them out &mdash; I mean, time is money! Besides, they're full of priceless relics...

::'''Lavonne:''' Great location in the outskirt of the city, energy and water already sorted out. For this fully furnished property with fabulous interior design, you need to bring nothing but yourself! High demand, limited supply! I'd want to take one for myself! Hey, you there! What are you waiting for?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm waiting for you to finish.
:::'''Lavonne:''' What else can be said? The price is unbeatable! I have friends in high places. You get my drift? My sources have told me that the price of this property will only go up in the next two years.
:::'''Lavonne:''' An increase of thirty percent... no, forty! To be honest with you, I'm being conservative here.
:::'''Lavonne:''' The actual number is at least this much. Don't look so scared. See what I mean here? I'm trying to keep it on the down low, because...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not looking to buy a property.
:::'''Lavonne:''' Sure, sure, young people are not in a hurry. I get it. Let's put it this way: From the perspective of an investor, we are not talking about a house to live in. It's an asset!
:::'''Lavonne:''' If I were you, I wouldn't miss out on this opportunity. Buy it now, wait for the price to go up and sell it. Easy money!
:::'''Lavonne:''' Tell you this, if you buy the property and decide to sell it at some point, no matter if you find a potential buyer, I'll list it for you 13% higher than the current price. You have my word.
::'''Lavonne:''' Trust me, I am the best local property agent. There hasn't been a house that I couldn't sell!

;(Talk to Lila)
:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What creatures are there in Belobog?
::'''Lila:''' Cats and dogs. There are wolves and birds in the wild... That's about it. You'll have to check out the museum's specimens to see what other kinds of animals there were in the past.
::'''Lila:''' I heard that hundreds of years ago, Belobog had domesticated bears, and direwolves roamed the wild. They're no longer around though.
::'''Lila:''' But I believe there are other animals out there that survived the Eternal Freeze. I just have no way to prove it. Now, I have no choice but to study humans...
::'''Lila:''' Did you know that humans in Belobog have at least three different origins? But you don't seem to belong to any one of them. That's why I was so surprised back then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You must be mistaken.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're right, I'm an alien.
::'''Lila:''' Haha, I must've been researching too much... Ever since I got my hands on that book, my head's been in the clouds.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wasn't bothered at all.
::'''Celine:''' Okay, I shall continue warming up my voice... Oh, no! The play isn't open to the public yet. I'd better not spoil it. I am so forgetful!
::'''Celine:''' Anyway, the play is still in rehearsal. I'm the leading.... actress' voice. If you like the song, we can meet again in the theater.

::'''Celine:''' I can feel something deep in the harmony... I know I'm still young, but I'm sure he's the one... la la la...
::'''Celine:''' Huh. Are you here for my singing again? That won't do. You need to enjoy the performance in the theater... Or are you here for something else?

;(Talk to Tamila)
:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:'''Tamila:''' As you can probably tell, my voice is rather low-pitched. The director is not very happy about that, so the theater hired a voice actress to "assist" me.
:'''Tamila:''' She is impeccable indeed... but I too was professionally trained. Never missed a day of practice.
:'''Tamila:''' Now I have to lip sync and act as if in a silent film. I can't help but think that maybe one day they'll get rid of me altogether...
:'''Tamila:''' What do you think I should do?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Work on your acting.
::'''Tamila:''' *sigh* That won't do. People come to musicals for the songs.
::'''Tamila:''' How embarrassing would it be if a musical performer can't sing with her own voice? It's ridiculous! I'll be like thespians who can't remember their lines and need others to read out the script for them.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not try acting in a play?
::'''Tamila:''' Both are theatrical arts, true. But the skills they require are hardly transferable.
::'''Tamila:''' Plus, musicals have always been my passion... I don't want to simply give up like this. I still want to give it a go.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Maybe find a project that suits your voice better.
::'''Tamila:''' I'm afraid it's not that easy.
::'''Tamila:''' You might not know this, but musical artists only look good on stage for a very limited period of time.
::'''Tamila:''' Once their physiques change or their voice becomes coarse, they have to bid the stage farewell. They'll call it "spending more time with the family," but everyone knows that's the end of their career.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You'll have to challenge that.
:::'''Tamila:''' Even if the theater agreed with me, the audience would not buy it. They have been quite honest in likes and dislikes.
:::'''Tamila:''' But you do have a point... people should be less judgmental.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are other types of musicals you can try.
:::'''Tamila:''' The theater manager is convinced that the audience is only interested in love songs aimed at teens. But it's possible that people's taste has changed and the management failed to grasp it.
:::'''Tamila:''' You know what? I'll see if I can bring some artists together and try some new things. How does that sound?
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Need to find a way to get your voice assist fired.
::'''Tamila:''' No, I want to keep my job fair and square. I have no interest in theater politics.
::'''Tamila:''' She is one of us after all. I hope she will see her dream come true on stage one day.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I can't think of a better way to help.
::'''Tamila:''' No worries. Thanks for listening to me. I feel much better already. Please keep this conversation a secret.

;(Talk to Amo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--during performance 501024201-->)
::'''Amo:''' ...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you looking at?
:::'''Amo:''' Things that were, things that are, and things that are yet to happen.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's so special about the trashcan?
:::'''Amo:''' Nothing. It is plain and lacks character, just like me.
::'''Amo:''' Ah, I am good for nothing. I am destined to end up in a trashcan.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't be so harsh on yourself.
:::'''Amo:''' You misunderstood me. I am pondering about life, value, and eternity.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're quite a poet.
:::'''Amo:''' Thank you. That was indeed my occupation.
::'''Amo:''' I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Amo. I write things for a living. Sorry for blocking your way... Hm? Can I help you with anything?
