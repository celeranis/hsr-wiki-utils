::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620203--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620301-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Business people like us are all about buying things from one place and selling them to other places. You might think that this meme isn't working out in Belobog, but someone might actually love it on some other planet.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' You came at the right time. I was hoping you'd be back for more stories. We're cooking up some toys today, and the materials are... {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cores of Ice}} and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Solid Water}}. Shall we begin?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's talk about this deal.
::'''Sampo:''' Truth be told, the inspiration for this came from a toy bird. With its expression stuck in horror, emitting a shrill screech whenever you squeeze on it... I really loved it.
::'''Sampo:''' With this thing, you can break the ice in any situation with ease, and an ice cube can only keep laughing to prevent itself from melting into a puddle of waste water in such a capricious age, haha.
