:'''Sensen:''' Thank you. I have to send Leili to the apothecary now.
:'''Sensen:''' I didn't think connecting to aurumatons was so dangerous. Master Gongshu had warned me many times, but I didn't heed his warning. I'm starting to regret it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe heed his warning next time...
::'''Sensen:''' Thank you. Maybe I should change my research topic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe find some work at a factory. You're not cut out for research...
::'''Sensen:''' I'm sorry. I... maybe I should give up on this topic.
::'''Leili:''' Don't give up... don't give up... I can continue to test with you...
::'''Sensen:''' I don't want you to get hurt. Just rest for now. We'll talk about it later.
:'''Sensen:''' It's my fault for being too hasty.
:'''Sensen:''' No matter what, I want to thank you. This is the reward you deserve. I should take Leili to the apothecary now.
:'''Leili:''' Thank you, we shall meet again.
