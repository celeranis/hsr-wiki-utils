;(Talk to Randolph)
:'''Randolph:''' (Trailblazer), you're here! The last shoot was extremely successful, and we're almost at our projected target sample number. Thanks to you, my stomach ache is almost gone, too!
:'''Randolph:''' I may have to ask you to help me go and photograph some more scattered memoria for now, though.
:{{DIcon|Travel Log}} Let's begin today's shoot.

;(Talk to Randolph)
:'''Randolph:''' My beloved assistant, (Trailblazer)! If you want to retake any pictures, you can come and find me any time.
:{{DIcon|Travel Log}} Let's begin today's shoot.
:<pre>{
	"$type": "RPG.GameCore.SetPerformanceResult",

:{{DIcon|Exit}} I've got something else to do.

}</pre>
:'''Randolph:''' Thank you so much, (Trailblazer). These pictures will make collecting and containing the memoria much easier.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does memoria really have a connection to being mara-struck?
:'''Randolph:''' If this were back when we had just met, I would have told you: "Absolutely."
:'''Randolph:''' But, if I'm truly honest, my answer is: "I don't know."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't even know?
:'''Randolph:''' Don't sound so disappointed. Science is a meticulous profession. One has to bravely set hypotheses and carefully confirm them. This is a hypothesis that I myself suggested, so naturally, it falls upon me to find a way to prove it.
:'''Randolph:''' I have been on the Xianzhou Luofu for some time now, and I have a rough understanding of the endless existences of long-life species. Many of them repeat the same life patterns over and over, like samples encased in amber.
:'''Randolph:''' Although they repeat their ways of life, the worries and pressures of life come in endless forms. Imagine for a second that you have spent a hundred years working to write official documents, enduring pressure from superiors and friction with colleagues...
:'''Randolph:''' Sooner or later, these pent-up emotions will transform one's mind and heart into an enclosed trashcan &mdash; filled with emotions like worry and fear, with no chance of release.
:'''Randolph:''' I plan to analyze the memoria we have collected and see if the emotions present within have a connection with being mara-struck or not... Unfortunately, I still lack the permission to meet with a mara-struck patient. So, all I can do for now is conduct research on the streets.
:'''Randolph:''' Alright, thank you for listening to my rambling. (Trailblazer), if you have spare time, remember to come and see me.
