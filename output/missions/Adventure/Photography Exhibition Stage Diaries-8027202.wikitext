:The first half of Dreamscape Shift is over. During the intermission, Clockie comes up to you.
:'''Clockie:''' Tick-tock! Pink-haired friend, gray-haired friend, it's all thanks to your support that the smart and brave Clockie managed to repel Boss Stone!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're welcome, tick-tock!
::'''Clockie:''' I have prepared a gift for you. Please accept it, tick-tock!

:'''Clockie:''' To be frank, I've been on Penacony so long, but this is the first time I've gotten a chance to be on stage. With this photo, my family will surely approve of my decision to strive for my dream on Penacony!
:'''March 7th:''' So it holds such deep sentiment! (Trailblazer), you must give this photo a great name.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Megabomb Change."
::'''March 7th:''' Err... I know you mean that his performance was the bomb, but some might understand it the other way...

;(Talk to Old Oti)
:Ohohoho, Old Oti is tickled pink by the show.
:You're starting to believe that he is only here as a judge purely out of personal interest.

;(Talk to Brother Hanu)
:Brother Hanu restlessly shifts his posture &mdash; you are interrupting his viewing of the show.

;(Talk to Robin)
:Robin maintains a professional smile, and flashes a wink at you all when the cameras aren't on her.
:Why is our Robin the only one without a bench to sit on? The show crew is so brazenly snubbing her!

:'''Old Oti:''' Ohohoho! That was marvelous. The three actors' performances were stellar. What a feat to portray the Sweet Dreams Troupe that provokes such endearment!
:'''Robin:''' Yes, these excellent actors deserve the audience's applause.
:'''Brother Hanu:''' Hmphs in approval.
:'''Old Oti:''' Now, please shed your disguises and show everyone your true visages!
:'''Lady:''' Judges, audience members... This IS what we really look like.
:'''Mr. Bigwig:''' Woof! I'm a genuine soda doggo!
:'''Old Oti:''' Ohohohoho, simply marvelous! Looks like our performers were too immersed in their acting... Let us applaud them again, to thank them for such a splendid performance!
:'''Lady:''' But... we are the Sweet Dreams Troupe to begin with?
:'''Starlet:''' Shh... (Trailblazer) said that we have to do something gimmicky like this to generate hype, and maybe the theater will get more awareness.
:'''Mr. Bigwig:''' Woof! Such thunderous applause... Is it all for me? I'm a syrupy soda about to burst with happiness!
:'''March 7th:''' ...So, you got all the monsters from the Dreamjolt Hostelry to play as themselves in an impressions show?
:'''March 7th:''' That's one way to go about it. Then again, we definitely got some shots that captured the stage's vibe!
:'''March 7th:''' Alright, last thing &mdash; name this photo!
