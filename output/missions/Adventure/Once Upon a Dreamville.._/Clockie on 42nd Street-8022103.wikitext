:The film generates a windfall for Clock Studios, and the theme park gradually regains its former status...
:'''Pisce:''' Director, do you know that the cinemas across the universe are thronged by viewers of ''Dreamjoy Memoir''? Our theme park is seeing more and more guests too!
:'''Pisce:''' It's been so many years... Since we lost contact with Mr. Watchmaker, we've never seen such a bustling scene.
:'''Pisce:''' The story is full of twists and turns, has a creative plot, and features lively characters... This has been my first time hearing nothing but good reviews from those fussy movie critics. It's your talent that brought Clock Studios back to life!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's no big deal.
::'''Pisce:''' You're being modest. Trust me, I don't mean this as flattery.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Indeed, I made it happen.
::'''Pisce:''' It's true, but let's not forget about Mr. Watchmaker's creative ideas and the animators' efforts. They worked hard too!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's next?
:'''Pisce:''' Well... Both critics and fans are looking forward to the release of the last film &mdash; ''Dreamjoy Secrecy''.
:'''Pisce:''' The screen should be fixed soon, just in time for the film premiere to be held at the theme park, but...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The film reel hasn't been fixed yet?
::'''Pisce:''' No, we've long done restoring the reel, but it isn't with us at the moment...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Watchmaker didn't create the fifth film?
::'''Pisce:''' No, Mr. Watchmaker has completed the piece for quite some time already...
:'''Pisce:''' But when we submitted the series for review, the Iris Family only banned ''Dreamjoy Secrecy''. They insisted that there were issues with the content and demanded an explanation from Mr. Watchmaker.
:'''Pisce:''' It's a dirty move... I'm sure they're deliberately making things difficult for us knowing Mr. Watchmaker isn't around.
:'''Pisce:''' Director, since you're an important guest of The Family, do you mind stepping in to convince them to take it easy on us?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll try...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sure they'll listen to me!
:'''Pisce:''' Thank you so much! The Iris Family conducts the review at the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Penacony Grand Theater}}. It'd be great if you could make a trip there. I'll be waiting for your good news!

::{{DIcon|Talk}} I'd like to ask you something.
:::'''Pisce:''' Sure! An in-depth understanding of the subject is essential in creating a masterpiece. Just ask away! I'll tell you everything I know.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What is ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' about?
::::'''Pisce:''' The series revolves around the story of Dreamville, where Clockie and his friends live &mdash; I bet you already know this.
::::'''Pisce:''' The series will delve into Clockie's arrival in Dreamville, his experiences of sharing life's ups and downs with the townspeople, and his contributions to the town's growth and development... It can be seen as a comprehensive collection of Clockie's story from the very beginning.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How is animation production done in Penacony?
::::'''Pisce:''' Producing animations in Penacony is pretty simple. Apart from the common techniques like smart illustration, mental projection, and algorithmic generation, there's also the Sweet Dreams Troupe which is skilled in drawing and capable of recreating the vintage hand-drawn graphic style...
::::'''Pisce:''' But here at Clock Studios, our storyboards are all hand-drawn by Mr. Watchmaker. He insists that our animators create the content for each frame themselves by hand.
::::'''Pisce:''' As animation technology in the universe continues to advance, the graphics of films nowadays become increasingly sophisticated. Still, none of those works can rival the hand-drawn ''Clockie'' in Penacony. We're proud of that!
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the destruction of the theme park.
::::'''Pisce:''' Oh, the mere mention of it saddens me. The theme park has always been one of our most important sources of offline revenue, but it was unexpectedly shut down by the Bloodhound Family for what they called a safety inspection...
::::'''Pisce:''' Guess what happened after their inspection? The screen in the theater was split in half, and the Sweet Dreams Troupe were all turned into Dreamjolt Troupe. They even tried talking their way out of it by saying the destruction was the doing of some outsiders. How ridiculous!
::::'''Pisce:''' That's not all. Later, a bunch of Nightingale Family members showed up, asserting that the destruction was unusual and exhibited signs of some... power of Nihility? Anyway, they inundated us with a barrage of technical terms and demanded an exorbitant repair fee that we simply couldn't accept.
::::'''Pisce:''' Shortly after, the Iris Family representative approached us and proposed to acquire our copyrights. If you ask me, those lineages are probably in cahoots with each other to take advantage of us when we're down and claim Clockie as their own!
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About your impression of the Watchmaker.
::::'''Pisce:''' Well... Although I've worked at Clock Studios for most of my life, I've only met the chairman once...
::::'''Pisce:''' It was an interview for my promotion. He actually held the interview at a party on the cruise ship "The Sunset."
::::'''Pisce:''' I already had a little too much to drink when I was dragged to a guest room deep in the corridor, inside of which was an immaculately dressed gentleman wearing a hat. He sat next to a window, staring into the distance at the colorful ocean of dream bubbles.
::::'''Pisce:''' He asked, "In your opinion, what does ''Clockie'' bring to the people?" I replied, "Happiness, laughter, heartwarming moments, and a bit of reflection on the sweet dreams." Honestly, the last one was just me blabbering away in my state at the time.
::::'''Pisce:''' He chuckled at my answer before dismissing me from the room. The following day, I received the appointment notice from the executive producer... What a mysterious guy.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the hero of Penacony.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the legendary Galactic Baseballer.
:'''Mimosa:''' Hmm, that title... You're the gray-haired guest who has recently helped The Family with their trouble, aren't you?
:'''Mimosa:''' Please forgive my rudeness earlier and allow me to introduce myself again. I'm Mimosa, a member of the Iris Family. Aside from business liaisons, I'm also in charge of managing the film and television productions in Penacony.
:'''Mimosa:''' Is there something you're looking for in the barred theater?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm looking for an animation film reel.
:'''Mimosa:''' Animation... Oh, you must be talking about ''Dreamjoy Secrecy'' by Clock Studios.
:'''Mimosa:''' Heh, the Nameless are indeed as helpful as they are described! You helped with the production of the four films recently released by Clock Studios, didn't you?
:'''Mimosa:''' I'm very sorry, but I can't give you the reel of this film. The decision to ban it was made by Maeven herself because its content didn't comply with The Family's standards. Its director, the Watchmaker, needs to come forward with an explanation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He can't make it here.
::'''Mimosa:''' Indeed, the Watchmaker can't make it here... In that case, I'm sorry to say that the release of the film is forbidden.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the director.
::'''Mimosa:''' No... The director of this film is the Watchmaker. It can't possibly be anyone else.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the Watchmaker.
::'''Mimosa:''' Haha, that's quite a sad joke. I'm well aware of whom the Watchmaker is.
:'''Mimosa:''' The ''Clockie'' series has evolved to become something beyond a mere piece of work by the Watchmaker. It embodies the spirit of Penacony and represents the image of a dream &mdash; joyful, pleasant, and harmonious...
:'''Mimosa:''' However, its creator keeps incorporating his own views and ideas into his works, especially in this film... There are simply too many references to elements in the real world that it is ruining Clockie's image...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know the Watchmaker personally?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you okay?
:'''Mimosa:''' It's nothing. If you don't mind, I'd like to get back to my work. Please just leave.

:Title: ''Gala of Finality''
:''The End of the Gala'' is a disaster film produced by Grady Films, depicting the apocalypse of Penacony. Due to the negligence of the Alfalfa Family, the society that is obsessed with extravagance collapses during the economic crisis. The greed of the people attracts the much-dreaded super Memory Zone Memes.
:The incompetent Family perishes along with the dream, leaving Penacony a desolate slum in the universe, visited by no one...
:Review: An attempt at scaremongering that can damage the image of The Family. The movie should be banned.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Investigate
:Title: ''Alarm Clockie''
:''Alarm Clockie'' is an independent film produced by a Dreamchaser. The story is about Alarm Clock Boy's adventure in Sleepy Town alongside Brother Nunoo, Cardboard Birds, and their challenge against President Pebble.
:Review: The story and character design of the movie violated the rights and interests of Clock Studios. The movie is banned until the expiry of Clockie's copyright.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Investigate
:Title: ''Aeon Genesis Preservation''
:This is a foreign film imported and produced by Interastral Peace Entertainment. The story is set in the universe after the occurrence of the Emperor's War II and centers around young IPC employees who pilot mechas to maintain galactic peace in the name of the Amber Lord.
:Review: From the 23rd to the 53rd minute, the monster named "Inherent Sin of Hundred Arms" that the IPC mechas are up against appears to allude to a certain Chordmaster. Additionally, the movie contains a lot of advertisements and elements that promote the belief in Preservation. It is recommended to cut the violating scenes before releasing the movie.

::'''Mimosa:''' Are these... letters from the Watchmaker for me?
::'''Micah:''' Yeah. I couldn't find you, so I kept these letters here, thinking that you might find them when you visit him...
::'''Micah:''' Now, I can finally return them to you.
::One, two, three drops... Tears fell onto the letter paper. At that moment, Mimosa seems to have forgotten the people around her as she softly verbalizes the letter's content...
::'''Mimosa:''' "My stubborn pony, how's life in the dream? When will you ever see this letter?"
::'''Mimosa:''' "I bet you're still mad at me for painting those ridiculous stories, restricting your freedom to create, and yet I never explain my reasons for doing so..."
::'''Mimosa:''' "Perhaps you'll find it hard to accept my reason, but I truly mean it &mdash; I wish to protect you and your aspiration."
::'''Mimosa:''' "I know. Ever since you were a child, you aspire to go to the idyllic dreams above the dome, to witness the Dreamchasers' happiness, and to see smiles on the guests' faces. That's because you're someone who loves to bring joy to others."
::'''Mimosa:''' "That's why I'm afraid. I'm afraid the stories I wrote in my creations will tarnish this innocence. I hope that there's always a dream in your heart. I hope you'll never be skeptical of this world."
::'''Mimosa:''' "But I've figured it out now. You are a courageous and kind child. Your pure intent will not be crushed easily. Hence, I am now willing to be truthful and tell you the reason for creating Clockie..."
::'''Mimosa:''' "It's because I do not want people to forget everything in their dreams."
::'''Mimosa:''' "From the conflict in the prison to the countless catastrophes, to the expansion of nightmares, to the establishment of sweet dreams... Along the way, I've witnessed the people in the dreams gradually coming to a standstill without looking back. They said the world outside of dreams is cruel, and one should no longer look back at these sorrowful pasts in dreams."
::'''Mimosa:''' "However, a pleasant dream must always move forward in a trail of blazing flame and look back. And so, I put my pen to paper and rely on my childhood friends to keep these precious memories for me."
::'''Mimosa:''' "If sometime in the future when all histories are covered in carols and all coming days are buried in laughter, and people can never wake up again, Clockie might be the wake-up call to their existence..."
::'''Mimosa:''' "Oh yes, do you still remember? I secretly told you once that the brain of Clockie is actually a compass &mdash; a compass that leads one to the future."
::'''Mimosa:''' "And now, this compass belongs to you. My past has already ended. Please use him to record your future."
::'''Mimosa:''' "Love always, Mikhail Char Legwork..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What an amazing animation artist.
:::'''Micah:''' Yes, the Watchmaker is Penacony's best animation artist... and will always be.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What an amazing father.
:::'''Micah:''' Heh, he's not the perfect father... but we will always love him. Am I right, Mimosa?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What an amazing trailblazer.
:::'''Micah:''' You're right. He has been trailblazing forward with his life and engraving his past memories in his creations...
::'''Mimosa:''' The Watchmaker... why didn't you let me know earlier?
::'''Micah:''' Mimosa, he had always wanted to protect you so he chose not to tell you about his less-than-glamorous past.
::'''Mimosa:''' But... if I had known about it earlier, I wouldn't have left Dreamflux Reef and abandoned Clockie...
::'''Micah:''' Heh heh. To put it in his words, that is the "route" you've chosen. Moreover... it isn't too late now, is it?
::'''Mimosa:''' ...Yes, it's not too late.
::'''Mimosa:''' I will request to meet Lady Maeven immediately and tell her... the Watchmaker is only trying to document the history of the Penacony that shouldn't be forgotten. I believe she will understand such a reason. After all...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} After all?
::'''Mimosa:''' Heh, it's nothing. She's a reasonable person, so don't worry about it.
::{{tx}}
:'''Angry Resident:''' Ugh, {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s a tough one...
:'''Dissatisfied Citizen:''' Don't worry, I just asked Mr. Micah to be here. They're finished!
:'''Micah:''' ...
:'''Angry Resident:''' Mr. Micah! We're counting on you to punish the traitor and her underling!
:'''Micah:''' I'm sorry you have to go through this, my friend from Astral Express.
:'''Dissatisfied Citizen:''' Ah, Astral Express... Could that be Mr. Watchmaker's...
:'''Micah:''' You guys should go. Don't embarrass Dreamflux Reef anymore.
:'''Angry Resident:''' O&mdash;Okay! Let's bolt. I think we've messed with the wrong person!
:'''Micah:''' My apologies, (Trailblazer) and Mimosa. Are you guys alright?
:'''Mimosa:''' I... I'm fine...
:'''Mimosa:''' ...Brother.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You two are... siblings?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you also a child of the Watchmaker?
:'''Micah:''' Just like Mimosa, I'm also an orphan adopted by Watchmaker. There are many more kids like us in Dreamflux Reef.
:'''Micah:''' When we got older, I chose to stay here in Dreamflux Reef while Mimosa pursued the life she desired in Penacony.
:'''Micah:''' By the way, how did the two of you meet?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because of ''Dreamjoy Memoir''...
::'''Micah:''' Yes, Pisce told me you were involved in the production of this film series.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because of the film reels left behind by the Watchmaker...
::'''Micah:''' Film reels... Oh, I think I know what you're saying. Are those for the ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' series?
::'''Micah:''' Pisce told me you were involved in the production of this film series.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because of an unpleasant argument...
::'''Micah:''' Huh? What led to the argument?
::'''Micah:''' Was it about... the recent Clockie movie?
::'''Micah:''' Pisce told me you were involved in its production.
:'''Micah:''' Did you run into any problems during the production? Mimosa used to work as the Watchmaker's animation assistant here before, and she knows Clockie's story like the back of her hand. If it's a technical glitch, you can discuss it with her...
