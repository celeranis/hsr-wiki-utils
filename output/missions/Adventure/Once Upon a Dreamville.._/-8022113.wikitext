;(Talk to Origami Animator)
:'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet, Origami Bird is resting now... Stop bothering me...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The trailer for Origami Bird's extra story has been released.
::'''Origami Animator:''' ...Tweet? Tweet! Isn't the deadline for that coming up real soon!?
::'''Origami Animator:''' I'm dead meat, tweet. There's no way out! Director, save me! Tweet, I have no idea what I'm going to shoot...
::'''Origami Animator:''' Lady Vermilion, Verdant Manager, Boss Red, Young Master Gold, Dr. Blues... everyone else only has one character in their extra story, but I've got five of these little birdies! That's totally unfair!
::'''Origami Animator:''' Director, do you know the backstories behind all these birds? That's going to dictate the content direction for the extra story!
:;(If {{Mission|Dream Song|showChapter=0}} has been completed)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dr. Blues filled me in about everything...
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet? Really? Quick, spill the tea, tweet!
::::'''Origami Animator:''' My goodness, that really is a tragic story...
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Joey, Vaughn, Barlow, Fischer... even Orla &mdash; they're actually magnificent Dreamweavers, tweet!
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Director, thank you for telling me all that. Their stories should not be forgotten... I'm going to use this extra story to record their biographies!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} They could be the Dreamweavers of Penacony.
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet! It's very possible. In the animation, they built Dreamville using stones and branches &mdash; just like how the Dreamweavers built Penacony using memoria!
::::'''Origami Animator:''' I heard that several of the Nightingale Family are Origami Dreamweavers. That must be their prototype!
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet, unfortunately, I don't know these Dreamweavers at all. I can only create based on material I can find online...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} They're just ordinary birds.
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet? Really? Then why would Mr. Watchmaker place them in such positions of importance?
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet... Could it be that he just likes having pet birds?
::::'''Origami Animator:''' Anyway, I'll go off in that creative direction seeing as that's what the director said!

::'''Origami Animator:''' All done, tweet! Here's the script about the Origami Birds!
::'''Origami Animator:''' Thank you, director. I can continue my nap now &mdash; here's the story for you!
:'''Origami Animator:''' Tweet, Origami Bird is resting now... Stop bothering me...
::This "birdie" seems to be slacking off. Go look for information that could perk it up.
