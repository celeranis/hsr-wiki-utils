;(Talk to Troupe Agent)
:{{tx}}
::'''Troupe Agent:''' Director (Trailblazer)? I've heard a lot about you. I'm a messenger from the Iris Family and also the person in charge of the Sweet Dreams Troupe.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're from the Iris Family too?
::'''Troupe Agent:''' Haha, I understand your concern &mdash; the kid that just came earlier was a newbie and may not have conveyed our message clearly. Please accept my apologies on behalf of the kid. I want to convey our utmost sincerity.
::'''Troupe Agent:''' Clockie has always been Penacony's most valuable brand figure. The Sweet Dreams Troupe of our Iris Family has also been a popular brand image that's been well-liked by tourists recently.
::'''Troupe Agent:''' So, the proposal I'm making isn't an acquisition at all, but a partnership! Together we can be greater by producing a new animation flick!
::'''Troupe Agent:''' I wonder if you have any interest in a film collaboration?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm all ears.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That tone sure changed fast...
:::'''Troupe Agent:''' Haha, as I'm sure you know, Director, a mutual victory is much more pragmatic than competition to us.
:::Is there any money in it?
:::'''Troupe Agent:''' Haha, as it is with such matters with mutual benefits, you will surely stand to gain as well.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there any money in it?
:::'''Troupe Agent:''' Haha, as it is with such matters with mutual benefits, you will surely stand to gain as well.
::'''Troupe Agent:''' The Iris Family has the best directors and most professional actors. We can provide all the film equipment and staff.
::'''Troupe Agent:''' We've even invited a special guest &mdash; the majestic trashcan buried in the dream...
::'''Troupe Agent:''' Of course, a partnership requires that both parties participate. We're willing to bill you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} (Trailblazer), as the executive producer. You can check in on the progress and content at the film set at any time.
::'''Troupe Agent:''' As for the script for this movie... I've also discussed it with Mr. Pisce, to adapt that classic tale &mdash; the most romantic and magical {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''Dreamjoy Ascension''}}! What do you think?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Interesting! Action!
:::'''Troupe Agent:''' Wonderful! The three directors at the set all appear to have run into a little trouble. {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Executive Producer, please go and lend a hand.
