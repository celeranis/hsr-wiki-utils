;(Talk to Soda Animator)
:'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Mr. Soda's extra story... What am I gonna do about that one...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The ''Mr. Soda'' extra story's commercial has aired.
::'''Soda Animator:''' Pfft... What!? That was fast!
::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* I feel like a bottle of SoulGlad that someone left the cap off... all out of fizz, with no more ideas bubbling up.
::'''Soda Animator:''' The Mr. Soda character is a co-production between SoulGlad Enterprise and Clock Studios. They say the model for the prototype was based on the drink's creator, Mr. Sousa.
::'''Soda Animator:''' Based on SoulGlad's ads, he was this incredible cook who believed deeply in Harmony. He was kind, selfless, affable, courteous...
::'''Soda Animator:''' But Mr. Watchmaker didn't seem very happy with that version. His character Mr. Soda is nothing like the graceful saint of legend but instead is this buffoon bottle always acting the fool.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this some kind of prank from the Watchmaker?
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Maybe. That chairman has always been at odds with The Family. I bet he won't like a great hero packaged up by the Harmony faith.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that called artistic license?
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Maybe. A self-righteous saint harping on about Harmony is boring, so a loveable buffoon like Mr. Soda is going to appeal more widely.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps that's his real self.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* I heard the characters in Clockie are all Mr. Watchmaker's old friends... Maybe the Mr. Sousa known to the chairman was just one such person.
::'''Soda Animator:''' No matter how I look at it, I can't integrate the magnificent Mr. Sousa with the rubberface antics of Mr. Soda... Director, you know the Watchmaker, so can you please help me put together this part of the script?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem!
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Thank you, this extra story finally has some legs!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do it yourself.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Don't be like that. I really can't think of anything. Don't make me leave it blank!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Am I doing more unpaid overtime?
:::'''Soda Animator:''' *gurgle* Don't be like that. You'll definitely learn plenty of Directorial Skills from this!
::'''Soda Animator:''' Come on, let's get creative in here...
::'''Soda Animator:''' "Ladies and gents, Mr. Soda's story starts before Clockie arrived. Back then, Dreamville was still known as 'Nightmareville,' and Boss Stone ruled the townsfolk with an iron fist. Here we find Mr. Soda, who was a local..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Chef.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Oh! That's great, and historically accurate too.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Youthful idol.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' This is fun, but can a bottle with a mustache that blows bubbles really be an idol...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Artificial weapon, "SoulGlad: Dreamhunter X."
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Hmm? Never heard of that before... but it sounds pretty cool. The kids are gonna love it!

::'''Soda Animator:''' Ok, let's keep going... "Mr. Soda was the local (chef/youthful idol/artificial weapon "SoulGlad: Dreamhunter X"), and worked tirelessly for Boss Stone night and day just like all the other townsfolk."
::'''Soda Animator:''' "Boss Stone commanded the townsfolk to dig up stones every day, but he only offered them swamp weed and soiled water from the crocodile lagoon as food and drink. Everyone was miserable from it."
::'''Soda Animator:''' "And so, Mr. Soda began to brew up a mysterious beverage. All of this was to..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Soothe the people's pain with sweetness.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Oh? That sounds like the kind of story SoulGlad Enterprise would tell. The sponsors will be happy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Make a huge sum of money.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Haha, that's just like Mr. Watchmaker's portrayal of Mr. Soda &mdash; cheap and greedy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Use the soda to control the minds of the people.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' It's interesting, but it doesn't exactly give me the vibe of a Clockie story...

::'''Soda Animator:''' "But his behavior angered Boss Stone, who would not allow anyone to transgress on his turf. The vile Boss Stone used a trick to capture Mr. Soda, and tossed him into a prison cell."
::'''Soda Animator:''' "However, Mr. Soda had a stroke of great fortune. He was met with an opportunity for freedom not long after being imprisoned &mdash; Brother Hanu and his gang had caused a riot and the Compass, which was carrying Clockie on it, had just arrived in town."
::'''Soda Animator:''' "Brother Hanu and Clockie loved Mr. Soda's drink, and they teamed up with him to fight together against Boss Stone."
::'''Soda Animator:''' "In the end, Boss Stone was driven off and peace was restored to Dreamville, and Mr. Soda..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Established a soda factory.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Yeah, well, that's what happened in the Clockie cartoon: Mr. Soda opens up a soda factory and keeps delivering great flavors for the townsfolk of Dreamville &mdash; a little something called SoulGlad.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perished on the battlefield.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' Wowsers, Mr. Sousa may have indeed died on the battlefield, but that detail's still a little cruel for an animation... Whatever. Audiences today adore that.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Became the new Boss Stone.
:::'''Soda Animator:''' It's a bold idea, but one with a nice moral lesson inside it: The dragonslayer becomes the dragon...
