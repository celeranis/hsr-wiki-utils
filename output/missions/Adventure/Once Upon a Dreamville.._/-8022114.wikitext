:'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Please don't disturb me, I am thinking...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The trailer for Old Man Wood's extra story has been released.
::'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Wait, I still have some important questions that I don't understand!
::'''Wood Animator:''' Director, have you ever considered how strange it is that all the other characters from ''Clockie'' can be seen all over the Dreamscapes, except for Old Man Wood?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think so, too.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' Right? The reasoning behind this is really complicated...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because Old Man Wood is very ugly.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Compared to other characters, he's not very cute...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's Old Man Wood?
:::'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Golly! The director doesn't even know about the character!
::'''Wood Animator:''' Old Man Wood was originally a character from the very first episode of ''Clockie''. Back then, he was this upright old citizen, a teacher and a friend to Clockie, and very trusted among the townsfolk.
::'''Wood Animator:''' But as the series progressed, this character gradually shifted from a gentle and wise old man into this arrogant old fogey. His vines start wrapping around the townhouses, and Clockie starts to push back against his teachings.
::'''Wood Animator:''' Perhaps The Family picked up on something, because after one meeting, this character never made it back onto the series again...
::'''Wood Animator:''' Unlike naive young people, I understand that ''Clockie'' is a story about Penacony's past, and that this change must mean something in and of itself.
::'''Wood Animator:''' But as for what such change represents, I still don't know... Director, what do you think? Your ideas will form the basis of this old codger's inspiration...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Family's power grows ever more encompassing.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' Ha, well that's a touchy theme, but it sure is the truth of it. From the initial aid providers to the current rulers, Penacony has changed an awful lot &mdash; for better or for worse.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' If that's the theme, then Old Man Wood would gradually be swallowed up by a ravenous lust for power, spiraling toward a path of paranoia...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The dreams lost their freedom.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' Ha, that's interesting. Lots of youngsters have failed to catch onto this change. In their eyes, this place has always represented a free utopia.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' If that's the theme, then it should be about Old Man Wood hating the loose disorganization of the town and the startling countermeasures he starts to take...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sweet dreams became orderly.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' Order... Yes, the Oak Family had added many rules to try and keep the dream alive. But Mr. Watchmaker is an unrestrained man, and someone as stubborn as he is wouldn't understand The Family's hard work.
:::'''Wood Animator:''' If that's the theme, then Old Man Wood should be trying to bring peace to the town &mdash; but ends up getting misunderstood by Clockie...

::'''Wood Animator:''' My grandpa once told me that the old Penacony used to be a mess. Any bad egg could come into this land of fantasy, and there was constant conflict inside and outside the dreams. Even the Dewlight Pavilion was once overrun by crooks...
::'''Wood Animator:''' It stayed that way until The Family conducted their reforms and created the Dreammaster, who ruled above the Five Lineages. The mysterious Dreammaster changed free and lax Penacony, letting The Family's gaze cover all of the Dreamscapes until those chaotic dreams were back to normal.
::'''Wood Animator:''' But, as you can see, the ever-extending tendrils of The Family would stop those who deserve to run during this process. It wasn't just the Watchmaker and Clock Studios who got entangled and fell... Was this good news or bad news?
::'''Wood Animator:''' Ha, I've said too much. In any case, I'll write this extra story based on your suppositions. Hold on a second...
::'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Alright, I'll leave this story in your hands.
::'''Wood Animator:''' As for that question... I believe you'll have your own answer, deep down in your heart.
:'''Wood Animator:''' *cough* Please don't disturb me, I am thinking...
::Who knows what this old-timer is thinking about. If you want him to pay attention to you, you'll have to come up with something to catch his attention.
