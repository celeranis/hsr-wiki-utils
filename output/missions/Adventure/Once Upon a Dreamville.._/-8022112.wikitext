;(Talk to Boss Stone Animator)
:'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Tsk, curse this job and curse Boss Stone!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The trailer for Boss Stone's extra story has been released.
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' No way, such terrible news and so soon. Clock Studios may as well just take my life and be done with me!
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' If Boss Stone were a powerful and clinical robot, I wouldn't be so worried. That kind of bad guy would bring in a stack of fans... But him, he's just a stupid fat crocodile! You can't even sell crocodile balloons as merch!
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Putting aside his popularity for now, I have no idea how to write his story. Boss Stone is the villain of Dreamville and, therefore, is the enemy of Penacony... But just look at this harmonious and friendly Planet of Festivities. Who could ever view this place as the enemy?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The IPC!
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Oh, it's possible alright! Back then, Penacony was an IPC prison, just as Dreamville used to be known as Nightmareville.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' But the IPC has a good relationship with Penacony now, so I don't know what Mr. Watchmaker is going to worry about a grudge from a thousand years ago. That'd be super petty...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Family!
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Oh, my word! Director! Please! Can you not say such crazy things?
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' However... our boss really doesn't get on with The Family well at all, so maybe actually... *shivers* I can't bring myself to think seriously about it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Astral Express!
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Ah? No way, I heard those Nameless aboard the Astral Express are all good folks with hearts of gold. No way they could be someone as unfathomably evil as Boss Stone?
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' However, I did hear about one Nameless who likes messing around in the Dreamscapes. Getting tangled up with the Bloodhound Family, harassing the Lordly Trashcan, even randomly stroking Pepeshis' fluff balls... That kind of style doesn't seem too dissimilar to Boss Stone.
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' But no matter who that person is, I know absolutely nothing about this crocodile &mdash; so could you help me riff some good ideas please, Director?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Thank goodness, you're a lifesaver! You can handle the whole thing, then!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know anything.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Huh? That's fine, I don't have to shoulder any responsibility anyway if anything goes wrong...
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Well, what I mean is... with power comes great responsibility. How could a great director's idea ever go wrong?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't. Bye.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' No, my dear director! Without your help, Clock Studios is going to lose the budget for an awesome extra story &mdash; not to mention a good employee!
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Fine, let's say no more and just get started right now...
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "Hey there, viewers. The protagonist of this story is one big bad egg who we're all very familiar with: Boss Stone!"
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "A long time ago, he subjugated the townsfolk of Nightmareville and did all kinds of wicked deeds &mdash; all so he could get..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Precious stones.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Yes, yes &mdash; stones. In the worldview of ''Clockie'', stone seems to be super important. All of Dreamville is built upon stones.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Beautiful trash.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' What? What's he gonna do with trash... I get it, you want to give the villain an odious character trait to create this deep impression on the audience. That really is incredible creativity!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wholesome love.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Huh? I have no idea what subjugating the townsfolk has to do with love, but it's a trope that plays out well with audiences nowadays &mdash; getting the villain to do all this evil out of love makes them seem less hateful.

::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Let's continue, then: "Boss Stone did all kinds of wicked deeds to the townsfolk, all so he could get (precious stone/beautiful trash/wholesome love). But his behavior grew increasingly excessive, and the stifled rage of the townsfolk began to grow and grow..."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "One day, a meteor crashed into the town. The crocodiles were at a loss for what to do, creating a chance for the townsfolk to launch a counterattack."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "Faced with townsfolk openly hostile against him, Boss Stone decided to..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Suppress them with violence.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Ooh, what a brutal and ruthless bad guy!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stir up discord.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Hey, would you just look at this cunning crocodile?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Push for democracy.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Huh? Would Boss Stone really ever choose to follow that kind of logic!?

::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Let's continue with our story: "Faced with townsfolk openly hostile against him, Boss Stone decided to (suppress with violence/stir up discord/push for democracy)... But in the end, he failed. The townsfolk chased him out of town."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "Nightmareville soon became Dreamville. However, Boss Stone had not yet given up and vowed to take back this place that once belonged to him. He blocked off the town's resources, and launched a punishing offensive..."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "Dreamville soon fell into desperation and the townsfolk bickered endlessly &mdash; but fortunately, clever Clockie sought out help from Old Man Wood who persuaded the townsfolk to reunite once again."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "Boss Stone didn't dare play up anymore. All he could do was..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cause trouble for the town from the shadows.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Huh, that darned crocodile. That is SO like him!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Turn over a new leaf as a new crocodile.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' That's good, a nice moral in it... But what about the rest of the story?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Live happily ever after together with everyone.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' The classic happy ending! But isn't that twist a little bit too much of a non-sequitur?

::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' "As the days passed by, the townsfolk gradually forgot about how brutal Boss Stone was. But still, this bad guy coveted Dreamville for himself. The day would come when he and his lackeys would rise up once again..."
::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' ...Director, is that the ending for our story?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes. That's it.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Great, we can start shooting the extra story now that all the tough stuff is out of the way.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Director, you really are a fresh creative! Just chatting a little bit with you has piqued my interest in this crocodile... This script really stays with you!
::{{DIcon|Return}} Let me think about it.
:::'''Boss Stone Animator:''' Cool, let's shake it up a little...
