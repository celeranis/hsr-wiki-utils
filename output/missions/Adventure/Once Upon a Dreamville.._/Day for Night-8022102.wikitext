::'''Pisce:''' Director, have you already finished making Brother Hanu's extra story? I heard that the Extra you shot explored Hanu's past from all kinds of angles. The animator for Brother Hanu's can't stop praising your narrative skills!
::'''Pisce:''' The animator is usually known for his arrogance, so we're going to need you to help him come up with some ideas. We're really sorry about this...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's alright.
:::'''Pisce:''' Ah, the director sure is considerate.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the reward?
:::'''Pisce:''' Uh... I'm sure you've gained some knowledge during the directing process, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then show me a token of your appreciation.
:::'''Pisce:''' *cough* So, like, the production team's been a bit stretched on the budget side of things recently. We hope you understand.
::'''Pisce:''' The repeating that's to follow is still editing the movie. The refurbishment fund of the theme park, the fate of Clock Studios, Mr. Watchmaker's expectation, and the future of Clockie... They are all in your hands, director!

::::'''Pisce:''' The series revolves around the story of Dreamville, where Clockie and his friends live &mdash; I bet you already know this.
::::'''Pisce:''' The series will delve into Clockie's arrival in Dreamville, his experiences of sharing life's ups and downs with the townspeople, and his contributions to the town's growth and development... It can be seen as a comprehensive collection of Clockie's story from the very beginning.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How is animation production done in Penacony?
::::'''Pisce:''' Producing animations in Penacony is pretty simple. Apart from the common techniques like smart illustration, mental projection, and algorithmic generation, there's also the Sweet Dreams Troupe which is skilled in drawing and capable of recreating the vintage hand-drawn graphic style...
::::'''Pisce:''' But here at Clock Studios, our storyboards are all hand-drawn by Mr. Watchmaker. He insists that our animators create the content for each frame themselves by hand.
::::'''Pisce:''' As animation technology in the universe continues to advance, the graphics of films nowadays become increasingly sophisticated. Still, none of those works can rival the hand-drawn ''Clockie'' in Penacony. We're proud of that!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the destruction of the theme park.
::::'''Pisce:''' Oh, the mere mention of it saddens me. The theme park has always been one of our most important sources of offline revenue, but it was unexpectedly shut down by the Bloodhound Family for what they called a safety inspection...
::::'''Pisce:''' Guess what happened after their inspection? The screen in the theater was split in half, and the Sweet Dreams Troupe were all turned into Dreamjolt Troupe. They even tried talking their way out of it by saying the destruction was the doing of some outsiders. How ridiculous!
::::'''Pisce:''' That's not all. Later, a bunch of Nightingale Family members showed up, asserting that the destruction was unusual and exhibited signs of some... power of Nihility? Anyway, they inundated us with a barrage of technical terms and demanded an exorbitant repair fee that we simply couldn't accept.
::::'''Pisce:''' Shortly after, the Iris Family representative approached us and proposed to acquire our copyrights. If you ask me, those lineages are probably in cahoots with each other to take advantage of us when we're down and claim Clockie as their own!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About your impression of the Watchmaker.
::::'''Pisce:''' Well... Although I've worked at Clock Studios for most of my life, I've only met the chairman once...
::::'''Pisce:''' It was an interview for my promotion. He actually held the interview at a party on the cruise ship "The Sunset."
::::'''Pisce:''' I already had a little too much to drink when I was dragged to a guest room deep in the corridor, inside of which was an immaculately dressed gentleman wearing a hat. He sat next to a window, staring into the distance at the colorful ocean of dream bubbles.
::::'''Pisce:''' He asked, "In your opinion, what does ''Clockie'' bring to the people?" I replied, "Happiness, laughter, heartwarming moments, and a bit of reflection on the sweet dreams." Honestly, the last one was just me blabbering away in my state at the time.

::'''Pisce:''' You can find animators to complete this extra story. Those animation-obsessed artists are all wearing various characters as headwear. You should be able to identify them immediately.

;(Talk to Hanu Animator)
;(If {{cx}}<!--Hidden Mission ID 8022111--> has been started)
::'''Hanu Animator:''' ...Hmph.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pisce asked me to find you and make the extra stories.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Hmph!? I'm not ready yet...
::'''Hanu Animator:''' ...
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Hmph...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Drop the act already.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmph.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' ...Hmph, quit it.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Director, it's not that I look down on this job, it's just that there are a few things about the Brother Hanu story that still bug me. Tell me, what kind of person is Brother Hanu exactly?
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Hmph, even people who know nothing about history should still have heard of who Brother Hanu was modeled after &mdash; {{Rubi|Hanunue|Rebel}}, the one who liberated Penacony.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' He was the one who broke the IPC's hold over the prison and named it "Penacony"... Yet Penacony has never seemed to thank this hero, and I don't recall ever seeing his statue or hearing his theme song in the dreams.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe he never existed.
:::'''Hanu Animator:''' Well, I don't know... Everyday people don't care about Penacony's past, except for directors and artists constantly mining everything for new material. Maybe the name is actually just a fictional one borrowed from some movie.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe someone out there's hiding his story?
:::'''Hanu Animator:''' Hmph, it's more than likely &mdash; the mighty liberation of Penacony was carried out by a lowly crook... If they couldn't steal his thunder, you can bet The Family would want his name struck from the Dreamscapes.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmph.
:::'''Hanu Animator:''' Hey, don't make fun of me. That ain't cool!
::'''Hanu Animator:''' But if you want to tell a tale about Brother Hanu, you'll have to understand a little more about this mysterious character.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' I spent a long time gathering up info to find out what kind of person Hanunue actually was, but I somehow turned up three different stories!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What were they?
::'''Hanu Animator:''' The first story I found was from a Penacony Grand Museum, where an information board claimed Hanunue was a {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|merciless criminal}} who had committed a flurry of serious felonies.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' He waged war in the Montour System prior to his imprisonment that cost millions of innocent lives, and despite freeing Penacony using brutal means, it was those same brutal means that turned Penacony into a nightmare.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' The executed corpses piled up high as mountains under his cruel regime, with war and disaster ravaging the world... Lots of material in the museum recounted horrors of the time, and there's probably no reason for The Family to have faked any of that.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What was the second one?
::'''Hanu Animator:''' The second story I heard was from a history professor at Paperfold University who told me Hanunue was a {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|righteous and selfless hero}}.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' According to this professor, Hanunue had been set up and wrongfully imprisoned. He was a kind and courageous Harbeck werewolf who could not bear to see his fellow inmates suffering &mdash; and so he led them in an uprising against the tyranny of the IPC.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' After winning the battle, he chose to cede power as the biggest hero and established the system of different lineages. He defended this world's freedom as the leader of the Hounds and fought for Penacony in the barren Dreamscapes right up until the eve of his death.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the third one?
::'''Hanu Animator:''' As for the third story, it might sound a little outrageous... but it's some unofficial history that I read about in the Primal Waking Library: Hanunue was just an ordinary {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Asdana wild wolf}}.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' At the frontier prison, suppression of inmates had reached a zenith. However, nobody dared to fire the first shot... until an out-of-control wild wolf stormed into the prison and bit an IPC guard, triggering mutiny among the inmates.
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Following independence, the prisoners used this wolf to build up the hero of Penacony's independence: Hanunue. But he never actually existed &mdash; he was just a romantic legend...
::'''Hanu Animator:''' Which of these three prototypes &mdash; "criminal," "hero," or "wolf" &mdash; do you think was the real Hanunue? Think carefully about it. I'll write a Brother Hanu story based on your answer.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A merciless criminal.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} I'd like to ask you something.
:::'''Pisce:''' Sure! An in-depth understanding of the subject is essential in creating a masterpiece. Just ask away! I'll tell you everything I know.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What is ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' about?
::::'''Pisce:''' The series revolves around the story of Dreamville, where Clockie and his friends live &mdash; I bet you already know this.
::::'''Pisce:''' The series will delve into Clockie's arrival in Dreamville, his experiences of sharing life's ups and downs with the townspeople, and his contributions to the town's growth and development... It can be seen as a comprehensive collection of Clockie's story from the very beginning.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How is animation production done in Penacony?
::::'''Pisce:''' Producing animations in Penacony is pretty simple. Apart from the common techniques like smart illustration, mental projection, and algorithmic generation, there's also the Sweet Dreams Troupe which is skilled in drawing and capable of recreating the vintage hand-drawn graphic style...
::::'''Pisce:''' But here at Clock Studios, our storyboards are all hand-drawn by Mr. Watchmaker. He insists that our animators create the content for each frame themselves by hand.
::::'''Pisce:''' As animation technology in the universe continues to advance, the graphics of films nowadays become increasingly sophisticated. Still, none of those works can rival the hand-drawn ''Clockie'' in Penacony. We're proud of that!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the destruction of the theme park.
::::'''Pisce:''' Oh, the mere mention of it saddens me. The theme park has always been one of our most important sources of offline revenue, but it was unexpectedly shut down by the Bloodhound Family for what they called a safety inspection...
::::'''Pisce:''' Guess what happened after their inspection? The screen in the theater was split in half, and the Sweet Dreams Troupe were all turned into Dreamjolt Troupe. They even tried talking their way out of it by saying the destruction was the doing of some outsiders. How ridiculous!
::::'''Pisce:''' That's not all. Later, a bunch of Nightingale Family members showed up, asserting that the destruction was unusual and exhibited signs of some... power of Nihility? Anyway, they inundated us with a barrage of technical terms and demanded an exorbitant repair fee that we simply couldn't accept.
::::'''Pisce:''' Shortly after, the Iris Family representative approached us and proposed to acquire our copyrights. If you ask me, those lineages are probably in cahoots with each other to take advantage of us when we're down and claim Clockie as their own!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About your impression of the Watchmaker.
::::'''Pisce:''' Well... Although I've worked at Clock Studios for most of my life, I've only met the chairman once...
::::'''Pisce:''' It was an interview for my promotion. He actually held the interview at a party on the cruise ship "The Sunset."
::::'''Pisce:''' I already had a little too much to drink when I was dragged to a guest room deep in the corridor, inside of which was an immaculately dressed gentleman wearing a hat. He sat next to a window, staring into the distance at the colorful ocean of dream bubbles.
::::'''Pisce:''' He asked, "In your opinion, what does ''Clockie'' bring to the people?" I replied, "Happiness, laughter, heartwarming moments, and a bit of reflection on the sweet dreams." Honestly, the last one was just me blabbering away in my state at the time.
::::'''Pisce:''' He chuckled at my answer before dismissing me from the room. The following day, I received the appointment notice from the executive producer... What a mysterious guy.

::'''Business Street Rep:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''Brother Hanu's Great Heist''}}. The story is set in Dreamville, and the main thing is to have our brand's imagery and Brother Hanu from ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' be in the same shot. It's a win-win for both sides.

:The refurbishment project is progressing along, and the corrosion of Nihility on the theme park's screen gradually fades...
:'''Pisce:''' Director, our film is all the rage now! Those investors who pulled out before are regretting their decisions!
:'''Pisce:''' The refurbishment of the theme park is also close to completion. I believe we'll be able to play ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' on the big screen soon. I'm excited already just imagining it!
:'''Pisce:''' There's one thing about the viewers' reviews though. Aside from compliments for the animation itself, there are many bizarre analyses and references speculating that our story serves as an allegory or metaphor for something...
:'''Pisce:''' ...There are even rumors saying that the key to a secret treasure left behind by the Watchmaker is hidden in our animation. That's way too far-fetched!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I suppose the viewers are over-interpreting the whole thing.
::'''Pisce:''' I guess so, but I can't rule out the possibility completely. Mr. Watchmaker might be the only one who knows for sure.
::'''Pisce:''' Nonetheless, those discussions have generated a lot of buzz for our film. It's nice to see the audience having different interpretations of the story.
::Maybe there really is a secret treasure?

::::'''Pisce:''' Producing animations in Penacony is pretty simple. Apart from the common techniques like smart illustration, mental projection, and algorithmic generation, there's also the Sweet Dreams Troupe which is skilled in drawing and capable of recreating the vintage hand-drawn graphic style...
::::'''Pisce:''' But here at Clock Studios, our storyboards are all hand-drawn by Mr. Watchmaker. He insists that our animators create the content for each frame themselves by hand.

::::'''Pisce:''' Oh, the mere mention of it saddens me. The theme park has always been one of our most important sources of offline revenue, but it was unexpectedly shut down by the Bloodhound Family for what they called a safety inspection...
::::'''Pisce:''' Guess what happened after their inspection? The screen in the theater was split in half, and the Sweet Dreams Troupe were all turned into Dreamjolt Troupe. They even tried talking their way out of it by saying the destruction was the doing of some outsiders. How ridiculous!
::::'''Pisce:''' That's not all. Later, a bunch of Nightingale Family members showed up, asserting that the destruction was unusual and exhibited signs of some... power of Nihility? Anyway, they inundated us with a barrage of technical terms and demanded an exorbitant repair fee that we simply couldn't accept.
