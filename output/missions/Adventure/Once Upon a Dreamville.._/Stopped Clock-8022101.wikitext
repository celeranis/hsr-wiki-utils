:'''Clockie?:''' You're not taking Clockie away!
::'''Clockie?:''' ''Clockie'' will always belong to Clock Studios and Mr. Watchmaker! You Family people can never have it!
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Sir, please calm down. I'm here to help you on behalf of the Iris Family.
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' The lovely Clockie has brought immense wealth to Penacony. Now that he's in a bind, the kind and beautiful Miss Note is ready to lend a hand.
::'''Clockie?:''' I'm sorry, but Clockie isn't in any trouble, nor does he need such hypocritical goodwill!
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Are you sure? The financial report of your company seems to tell a different tale though...
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' The patent is about to expire, {{Rubi|the chairman|Watchmaker}} has gone missing, and the commemorative movie has been postponed... The urgent reopening of the theme park despite the accident is your way to ease the cash flow pressure, right?
::'''Clockie?:''' Umm...
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' How is Clock Studios going to solve all these problems without The Family's help? Is there anyone outside the silver screen that can save the company with "clockwork"?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Believe it or not, there actually is.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who called upon me? I have arrived!
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' ...Oh?
::'''Clockie?:''' I'm sorry, guest. We're in the middle of a business discussion here. Please bear with us...
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Wait, why don't you let the guest give you the most genuine feedback?
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Just look at Clock Studios Theme Park right now &mdash; The most iconic silver screen is broken, the sky is all gloomy, and the Dreamjolt Troupe is walking all over the place.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not really.
:::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Look, that's the guest's objective and genuine opinion.
:::How thrilling, just the way I like it.
:::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Well... Can't believe ''Clockie'' is now being associated with excitement and thrills instead of warmth and joy... This doesn't bode well.
:::Dewlight Pavilion is more fun.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How thrilling, just the way I like it.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dewlight Pavilion is more fun.
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Alas, it's a shame that the theme park has even less pull than our office now...
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' ...Anyway, I must remind you that Dewlight Pavilion isn't somewhere you can come and go at will.
::'''Iris Family Representative:''' Now, your audience's feedback is your answer &mdash; you are shooting yourselves in the foot with your futile effort to turn things around.

;(Talk to Clockie?)
:'''Clockie?:''' That was just a... minor business dispute. I'm sorry you had to see it.
:'''Pisce:''' My name is Pisce, the producer for the Clockie franchise. Welcome to the Clock Studios Theme Park!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you dressed like this?
::'''Pisce:''' This is fun, isn't it? Tick-tock, do I look like the cartoon star of Penacony &mdash; Clockie?
::You look familiar.
::'''Pisce:''' Haha, this is the cartoon star of Penacony &mdash; Clockie!
::Holy Stellaroni! Clockie!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look familiar.
::'''Pisce:''' Haha, this is the cartoon star of Penacony &mdash; Clockie!
::Holy Stellaroni! Clockie!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Holy Stellaroni! Clockie!?
:'''Pisce:''' That's right! It's Clockie &mdash; the mascot of Penacony and the brightest star in Dreamville!
:'''Pisce:''' All our cast members are dressing up as the characters in ''Clockie'' for the recent reopening of the theme park. We want to look more approachable while interacting with the audience.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of issue?
::'''Pisce:''' Well... As you know, Clock Studios was established by the mysterious Watchmaker.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's The Family after?
::'''Pisce:''' Their representative made us an offer to buy the copyrights of Clockie, claiming that they were trying to save the company...
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there a solution to fix this?
::'''Pisce:''' There is... We've been preparing a film series to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Clockie called {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''Dreamjoy Memoir''}}!
::'''Pisce:''' It's a much-anticipated piece that is a collection of all ''Clockie'' stories over the past five centuries. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|If we get to release the series, I believe we can turn the tide with the box office earnings and fund the refurbishment of the theme park.}}
::'''Pisce:''' The thing is, the film reels of the series were severely damaged in the earlier accident. Despite our best efforts to repair them, we can only salvage some fragmented scenes, mixed with scrapped storylines. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|We have to re-edit it.}}
::'''Pisce:''' Alas, who would have seen the Watchmaker's disappearance coming? He's the director of the film, and every crew member knows that Clockie's story is inspired by his experiences. However, none of us knows much about his background, nor do we dare to take on the director's role without authorization.
::'''Pisce:''' For Clockie's future, please keep us posted if you know anything about the Watchmaker's whereabouts or someone who's {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|familiar with his story}}!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm familiar with the Watchmaker's story.
:::'''Pisce:''' Really? Now isn't the time to joke around!
:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} I'm telling the truth.
::::'''Pisce:''' Well... It's not that I find you untrustworthy, but there are simply too many things that are untrue in dreams. I'd appreciate it if you could show me some proof.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} (Present the invitation letter from the Watchmaker)

::'''Pisce:''' Right. I wonder if the Watchmaker's message managed to get passed to the audience... Director, can you ask the viewers for their opinions?
;(Otherwise)
::'''Pisce:''' Director, you're back! Do you want to do some film editing?
::{{DIcon|Travel Log}} Begin editing.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} I'd like to ask you something.
:::'''Pisce:''' Sure! An in-depth understanding of the subject is essential in creating a masterpiece. Just ask away! I'll tell you everything I know.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What is ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' about?
::::'''Pisce:''' The series revolves around the story of Dreamville, where Clockie and his friends live &mdash; I bet you already know this.
::::'''Pisce:''' The series will delve into Clockie's arrival in Dreamville, his experiences of sharing life's ups and downs with the townspeople, and his contributions to the town's growth and development... It can be seen as a comprehensive collection of Clockie's story from the very beginning.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} How is animation production done in Penacony?
::::'''Pisce:''' Producing animations in Penacony is pretty simple. Apart from the common techniques like smart illustration, mental projection, and algorithmic generation, there's also the Sweet Dreams Troupe which is skilled in drawing and capable of recreating the vintage hand-drawn graphic style...
::::'''Pisce:''' But here at Clock Studios, our storyboards are all hand-drawn by Mr. Watchmaker. He insists that our animators create the content for each frame themselves by hand.
::::'''Pisce:''' As animation technology in the universe continues to advance, the graphics of films nowadays become increasingly sophisticated. Still, none of those works can rival the hand-drawn ''Clockie'' in Penacony. We're proud of that!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the destruction of the theme park.
::::'''Pisce:''' Oh, the mere mention of it saddens me. The theme park has always been one of our most important sources of offline revenue, but it was unexpectedly shut down by the Bloodhound Family for what they called a safety inspection...
::::'''Pisce:''' Guess what happened after their inspection? The screen in the theater was split in half, and the Sweet Dreams Troupe were all turned into Dreamjolt Troupe. They even tried talking their way out of it by saying the destruction was the doing of some outsiders. How ridiculous!
::::'''Pisce:''' That's not all. Later, a bunch of Nightingale Family members showed up, asserting that the destruction was unusual and exhibited signs of some... power of Nihility? Anyway, they inundated us with a barrage of technical terms and demanded an exorbitant repair fee that we simply couldn't accept.
::::'''Pisce:''' Shortly after, the Iris Family representative approached us and proposed to acquire our copyrights. If you ask me, those lineages are probably in cahoots with each other to take advantage of us when we're down and claim Clockie as their own!

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About your impression of the Watchmaker.
::::'''Pisce:''' Well... Although I've worked at Clock Studios for most of my life, I've only met the chairman once...
::::'''Pisce:''' It was an interview for my promotion. He actually held the interview at a party on the cruise ship "The Sunset."
::::'''Pisce:''' I already had a little too much to drink when I was dragged to a guest room deep in the corridor, inside of which was an immaculately dressed gentleman wearing a hat. He sat next to a window, staring into the distance at the colorful ocean of dream bubbles.
::::'''Pisce:''' He asked, "In your opinion, what does ''Clockie'' bring to the people?" I replied, "Happiness, laughter, heartwarming moments, and a bit of reflection on the sweet dreams." Honestly, the last one was just me blabbering away in my state at the time.
::::'''Pisce:''' He chuckled at my answer before dismissing me from the room. The following day, I received the appointment notice from the executive producer... What a mysterious guy.

:::{{DIcon|Return}} I don't have any other questions.
::::{{DIcon|Travel Log}} Begin editing.
::::{{DIcon|Exit}} Maybe next time.
:::::'''Pisce:''' No problem. You're always welcome to come back and be part of the production!

:::'''Pisce:''' No problem. You're always welcome to come back and be part of the production!
:'''Pisce:''' I'm surprised you've mastered the production techniques of Dreamscape animation so quickly! Your editing style, performance, and plot arrangement are just like Mr. Watchmaker's. You've done a terrific job!
:'''Pisce:''' Dear guest... I mean, director, I'd like to sincerely invite you on behalf of Clock Studios to join the production team of the ''Dreamjoy Memoir'' animation!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's it? I'm the director now?
::'''Pisce:''' That's right! The post-production of Dreamscape animations isn't too difficult and doesn't require advanced skills. We only need a director who knows the Watchmaker well and whose ability is recognized by him. After all, this is his story.
::I didn't say I wanted the job.
::'''Pisce:''' Please do us a favor! The film series means a lot to Mr. Watchmaker! We can't allow it and the theme park to go into oblivion in the Dreamscape!
::My services are expensive!
