===Find Silvermane Captain Dunn===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone|Word has it that a certain Captain of the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone is looking up and down for a group of outsiders, who are said to be well-dressed with a lordly bearing. They knocked out half of the soldiers in the Restricted Zone... including the Captain himself.<br />Does he want payback? Or is he so impressed by how good of a fighter you are and decided to become a student of yours? The latter, however unlikely it seems, may as well be plausible.<br />In any event, perhaps you should pay a visit to this Captain. Just try not to beat the snot out of everyone this time around.}}
