{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Natasha's Clinic|I've felt there's a weight pressing down on me and making it hard to breathe ever since I arrived on the Luofu.<br />Initially, I thought it might have been an injury, then I was worried it might be my body not adapting to this gravity. At the end, I finally found the cause of the symptoms &mdash;<br />I'm the first athlete in Belobog in 700 years to go fight a competition in sky.<br />I'm carrying my entire home planet on my shoulders.}}
