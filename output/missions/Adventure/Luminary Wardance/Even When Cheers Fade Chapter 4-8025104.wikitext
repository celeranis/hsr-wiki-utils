{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Skysplitter|update|You can probably guess who this "Independent Contestant &mdash; Iron Arm" is, so there's no need to play up the mystery here.<br /><br />Let's chat about some unimportant Luminary Wardance behind-the-scenes gossip instead.<br />You might have discovered that Hook and Svarog didn't make much of an appearance in the story. It's because they are busy with their own affairs.<br />Apart from taking part in the competition, Svarog is also visiting the shops in Luofu with Hook. He wants to bring some souvenirs to Clara but doesn't know what to buy, so after some "calculation" &mdash; He figures that Hook, as another female child, must know what to buy for Clara! He can't go wrong listening to Hook!<br /><br />A few days later in the Robot Settlement,<br />Clara sinks into deep thought as she gazes upon the six boxes of mung bean soda before her.}}
