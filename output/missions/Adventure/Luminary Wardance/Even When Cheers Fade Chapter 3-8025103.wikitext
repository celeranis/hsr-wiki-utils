{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Skysplitter|The Luofu made a great call to invite the Knights of Beauty as guests.<br />Firstly, they all look good, so the tickets sell like hotcakes. Secondly, they have both outstanding martial prowess and peerless morals, so they would never accidentally hurt their opponent. Thirdly, they're basically monastic monks and do not care much for the invitation fee, making them very cost-effective.<br />Now that you think about it, Argenti really does take a liking to Luka. Maybe it's because they look similar.}}
