===Head to the Skysplitter===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Skysplitter|March 7th actually managed to get a backstage pass for the Wardance? That'd be a huge loss if you don't go and check it out.<br />It feels like she has rapidly become a powerful figure on the Luofu in just a few short weeks... Would you get a discount in a restaurant if you tell the owner you know her?}}
