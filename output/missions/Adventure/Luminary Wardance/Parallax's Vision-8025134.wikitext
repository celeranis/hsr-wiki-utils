===Discuss the IPC's offer{{subst:void|<!--802513402-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Skysplitter|update|Regarding the collaboration proposed by Topaz, discussion is needed with Luka and Carmella.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Carmella)
:'''Carmella:''' It's too early to decide. Let's meet with the IPC first before making a decision.

;(Talk to Luka)
:'''Luka:''' Coach (Trailblazer), can you head over to Aurum Alley with me? I need to decline their offer in person.
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:'''Carmella:''' Our opponent, Shuojin, appears to be a fighter using Xianzhou ancient martial arts.
:'''Carmella:''' His combat history suggests he's not particularly formidable. You should be able to take on this challenge with confidence.
:'''Luka:''' Understood. Still, I never underestimate any opponent.
:'''Carmella:''' Also... Are you sure you won't reconsider partnering with the IPC for business?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not entirely off the table.
::'''Luka:''' I'm not sure... I personally don't want to agree to it, but I don't know if it's wise to refuse it outright.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is far too risky.
::'''Luka:''' I agree. Coming from a small town, I find the intricate games these big players play are just beyond me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Doesn't working with you essentially mean collaborating with the IPC?
::'''Carmella:''' It's completely different! I'm just a sports journalist, and I don't have any business dealings with Contestant Luka.
:'''Luka:''' I'm leaning towards declining this business partnership... but whether I refuse or agree to it, it seems right to give a response in person.
:'''Luka:''' Coach (Trailblazer), can you head over to Aurum Alley with me?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to Aurum Alley with Luka and meet Topaz{{subst:void|<!--802513403-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Topaz is waiting for Luka in Aurum Alley.<br />Luka wishes to refuse her invitation face-to-face as a gesture of respect. You should go with him.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Topaz)
:'''Topaz:''' Thanks for your frankness, Luka. If you change your mind, you can reach out anytime.
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:'''Topaz:''' Good to see you again, Luka, (Trailblazer).
:'''Luka:''' Hello, Miss Topaz.
:'''Topaz:''' Even though we are acquainted, I had formally expressed my intention to collaborate with you through the committee.
:'''Topaz:''' The Strategic Investment Department would like to hire Luka as our brand ambassador, working closely with him across our entire product line.
:'''Topaz:''' This role would boost Luka's visibility &mdash; "Luka the Strongarm" could become a name featured on billboards throughout the cosmos.
:'''Topaz:''' Then Belobog, as the hometown of a superstar, would certainly attract more development opportunities!
:'''Topaz:''' This endorsement benefits both Belobog and the IPC.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It does sound promising.
::'''Topaz:''' Absolutely. My principle has always been to ensure our partners get real, tangible benefits.
::Is the IPC really that generous?
::'''Topaz:''' Well... The IPC isn't exactly generous, and I'm certainly not running a charity. It's purely a mutually beneficial business deal, nothing more.
::Why do you keep focusing on Belobog?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the IPC really that generous?
::'''Topaz:''' Well... The IPC isn't exactly generous, and I'm certainly not running a charity. It's purely a mutually beneficial business deal, nothing more.
::Why do you keep focusing on Belobog?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you keep focusing on Belobog?
:'''Topaz:''' Because I'm the one who worked on this case, naturally. Don't you want to contribute something to Belobog? We are on the same side in this regard.
:'''Luka:''' ...May I take a moment to think this over, if that's okay?

{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to the lounge with Luka{{subst:void|<!--802513404-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Skysplitter|update|Luka politely declined the IPC's collaboration request. Out of the kindness of her heart, Topaz warned you as you said your goodbyes to each other &mdash; The contestant named Shuojin is bound to use plenty of "dirty tricks."}}

:{{tx}}
:'''Luka:''' Dirty tricks? I've come across some fighters who like to rely on dirty tricks in my days in the ring, like one guy who always snuck laxatives into his opponents' drinks.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Interesting. I know a blade master who does that too.
::'''Luka:''' Hahaha, you sure know a variety of people, coach!
::Better keep an eye on your water bottle then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Better keep an eye on your water bottle then.
:'''Luka:''' Hahaha, coach, I'm counting on you to keep a close watch!

:{{tx}}

;(Talk to Lingsha)
:'''Lingsha:''' Get back to your training quickly! It's time to show that rumor-spreader a lesson!
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:'''Lingsha:''' (Trailblazer) and Luka, here you are! Luka, has the tuskpir been helpful to you?
:'''Luka:''' Thank you. That tuskpir has been helpful, and my sleep quality has improved a lot...
:'''Luka:''' But today... I had a very strong hallucination...
:You briefly describe the predicament Luka is facing.
:'''Luka:''' Hmm... after reading that article, I can't stop overhearing people discuss me on the street... Later, I found myself slipping into a hallucination and ended up in a fight...
:'''Lingsha:''' Don't worry. It's just the mental stress causing neurotic exhaustion, further intensifying your hallucinations.
:Lingsha had the alchemist bring over an incense burner. She lights the aromatherapy, and soothing smoke spreads.
:'''Lingsha:''' Rest here for a bit. Being in a constant state of pre-competition tension isn't good for your health.
:'''Luka:''' It feels terrible... it seems like everyone misunderstands me. I try to explain, but they won't listen...
:'''Lingsha:''' What is there to explain? Those who initially believed in you don't require your explanations, and those who are determined not to believe won't listen to your explanations.
:'''Luka:''' Are we just going to let the public opinion slander me like this?
:'''Lingsha:''' Public opinion... it's like the smoke in this incense burner, drifting with the wind. The wind will eventually shift, and not all of it will blow against you all the time.
:'''Lingsha:''' You might think everyone is talking about you, but that's because you're near the Skysplitter arena.
:'''Lingsha:''' But... Looking at all of the Luofu... Most of them would not know about an outworlder boxer participating in the Wardance.
:'''Lingsha:''' Years ago, I faced rumors within the Luofu's Alchemy Commission and had to travel far with my master.
:'''Lingsha:''' Those issues have dissipated into thin air over time. Now, I've returned to the Luofu to oversee the Alchemy Commission.
:'''Luka:''' Do you mean I should simply fight well in this invitational match and prove myself with my skills?
:'''Lingsha:''' I believe this is the best way you can truly handle rumors right now.
:'''Lingsha:''' How are you feeling now? Better? Get back and prepare for the match if you are feeling better!
:'''Luka:''' I feel much better. Thank you, Cauldron Master!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's just like a magic cure!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If only rumors could be dispelled with incense.
:'''Lingsha:''' Enough with the jokes. Get back to training for the match! Show that rumor-spreader what you're made of!

:'''Luka:''' Miss Topaz? What are you doing here?
:'''Topaz:''' I heard your bout with Shuojin was starting soon. I thought I'd come by.
:'''Carmella:''' Miss Topaz offers her assistance to help you handle the trouble caused by Shuojin.
:'''Luka:''' We're responsible for this mess, and there's no need to involve the IPC.
:'''Luka:''' If I accept your help, Miss Topaz, I'll owe you a favor. It would be hard to say no to you later about any business matters.
:'''Topaz:''' Don't put it that way. I'm not just helping you for your sake, but also for the IPC's reputation.
:'''Topaz:''' If he were merely spreading rumors about you, I wouldn't get involved. But this controversy should not taint the IPC. My intervention is completely justified.
:'''Topaz:''' And I certainly wouldn't use a favor to coerce you into doing something you're uncomfortable with. Rest assured.
:'''Luka:''' Thank you, Miss Topaz, for your consideration. However, I abide by my principles &mdash; if I owe a favor, I must repay it.
:'''Luka:''' Someone once told me public opinion is like incense smoke, drifting with the wind. Just wait for the wind to change, and all these rumors will dissipate.
:'''Luka:''' Right now, I need to prove myself with my fists in the ring.
:'''Topaz:''' Alright, I understand. I won't insist on you accepting my help.
:'''Topaz:''' However, if I may offer a piece of seasoned advice &mdash; the quickest way to clear the smoke is to put out the fire.
:'''Topaz:''' You're right. All storms pass eventually, but waiting takes time, and time is costly.
:'''Topaz:''' I'm off now. Should you change your mind, remember to call me.
:'''Carmella:''' Luka, I think you should have accepted Miss Topaz's help... Coach (Trailblazer), what's your take?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should have accepted her assistance.
::'''Carmella:''' Indeed! How often does one get the opportunity to use resources from the Strategic Investment Department to solve personal problems?
::Just proving myself in the arena should suffice.
::'''Carmella:''' What really can be proven in the ring? In the court of public opinion, allegiances outweigh facts, labels trump perspectives, emotions eclipse logic, and outbursts overshadow deep discussions. Who are you trying to convince?
::The truth will always reveal itself.

:'''Luka:''' I won fair and square, but... why did things turn out this way?
:'''Luka:''' ...
:'''Luka:''' Some online sources claim that Jarilo-VI is an extinct planet. But aren't the people of Belobog still alive?
:'''Luka:''' They're saying I'm a stowaway using a fake identity... Hey, I entered the Xianzhou properly through the Sky-Faring Commission customs!
:'''Luka:''' Some even say I used to be part of the Annihilation Gang... Right, Miss Carmella, what does the Annihilation Gang do? Never mind. You don't have to answer, as the name tells me it's nothing good.
:'''Carmella:''' ...
:'''Luka:''' There's a comment claiming my arm was chopped off by a swordmaster from the Xianzhou, so I got my current prosthetics specifically to challenge fighters from the Luofu.
:'''Luka:''' ...
:'''Luka:''' Such jokes... are not funny at all!
:'''Carmella:''' Luka, stop looking at these. It's not helping your current state.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Miss Carmella is right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The best thing to do now is to put down your phone.
:'''Luka:''' I understand! I know I should take everyone's comments lightly. But I can't pretend nothing happened! Some of my supporters briefly defended me, only to face backlash online.
:'''Luka:''' Back in Belobog, I never realized that winning a match could hurt so many people...
:'''Carmella:''' When we are all together at the arena, everyone indeed cheers for the winner.
:'''Carmella:''' But outside of the arena, especially online... not everyone is happy for the winner. After all, being continuously successful can be seen as arrogance to some.
:'''Carmella:''' But that doesn't mean everyone wants to see you fail, Mr. Luka! There are supporters for you. Online, unfriendly voices always seem particularly loud and harsh, overshadowing the supportive voices.
:'''Carmella:''' Moreover... if you could redo today's match, would you choose to lose to Shuojin just to avoid these grating voices?
:'''Luka:''' I... would never pretend to lose to anyone for any reason.
:'''Carmella:''' That's right! What you should do now is get your spirits up and win more matches for those who are still supporting you.
:'''Luka:''' ...
:'''Luka:''' Miss Carmella, Coach, I'm going to start training for today.
:'''Topaz:''' Truly Luka the Strongarm! Not only did you take on your opponent's punches, but you weathered this wave of public opinion too.
:'''Carmella:''' It's... Miss Topaz, welcome! Great to have you here!
:'''Topaz:''' Hello, Miss Carmella, (Trailblazer), and Luka. I came to check on how Luka is doing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just checking in?
::'''Topaz:''' Not just for that. I'm here to deliver an invitation to Luka for an event.
::Luka has already refused endorsements.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Luka has already refused endorsements.
:'''Topaz:''' I know. I'm not here about the endorsement. Given the online rumors... he and IPC shouldn't, and couldn't enter into a business partnership now, as it would be unprofitable for both sides.
:'''Topaz:''' My visit is purely to deliver an event invitation to Luka.
:'''Carmella:''' An event invitation?
:'''Topaz:''' Riding on the momentum of the Wardance, the IPC plans to hold a small product launch event here on the Skysplitter. It would be an honor if Luka could attend.
:'''Luka:''' Wouldn't that just validate the online rumors? They've been smearing me as the IPC's lapdog...
:'''Topaz:''' My invitation could solve this headache for you.
:'''Topaz:''' We've signed a new ambassador, who will make an official appearance at this product launch.
:'''Topaz:''' Luka showing up at the event, but not as the ambassador, would dispel baseless speculations, and soon the rumors will dissipate.
:'''Topaz:''' By the way, I brought you a new combat prosthetic as a gift. I noticed some slight malfunctions in your iron arm during the last match. The wear and tear is probably so much that the arm is no longer suitable for use, I presume?
:'''Topaz:''' You refuse to take the IPC's money, which troubles me, so I have to "bribe" you with these little favors.
:'''Luka:''' But...
:'''Topaz:''' Don't bring up anything about the prosthetic's cost. That'll hurt my feelings. Make sure you gear up and get ready for your next match.
:'''Topaz:''' It's getting late. I still need to prepare for the launch event. Farewell for now.
:'''Luka:''' Miss Topaz, wait! Why are you helping me solve these troubles?
:'''Topaz:''' Your Jarilo pride is as cold and hard as a rock in the snow. Are you trying to figure out what plans I've got?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I smell a conspiracy...
::'''Carmella:''' Hey! Don't assume everyone at the IPC is out to play dirty.
::'''Carmella:''' Miss Topaz could have acted oblivious and ignored Mr. Luka, who is at the center of public scrutiny. Instead, she chose not to shy away from suspicion and extended the invitation. Isn't it unfair to question someone's good intentions?
::No, not at all, thank you, Miss Topaz.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, not at all, thank you, Miss Topaz.
:'''Topaz:''' I respect those who can't be bought... or rather, everything related to Belobog is under my project, and I have to consider its long-term interests. Pick whichever reason you want to convince yourself. See you tomorrow.

{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Topaz)
:'''Topaz:''' Welcome, both of you. Luka, I'm glad you could overlook the public scrutiny and join us for the event.
:'''Topaz:''' The launch event is about to start.
:As powerful music plays, the host sways onto the stage.
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Ladies, gentlemen, elders, and community members! Whether the Luofu has a day-night cycle &mdash; good morning, good afternoon, and good evening! I'm your favorite host, Owlbert!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' The recent match between Luka and Shuojin likely left many spectators feeling outraged. How could the honorable and brave Shuojin lose to the cunning and deceptive Luka? It's simply too much to bear!
:'''Audience:''' Down with Luka! Avenge Shuojin!
:'''Spectators:''' Avenge! Avenge! Avenge!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' So today, under my arrangement, a rematch has been organized specifically for Shuojin. The target, of course, is the notorious Luka "Strongarm"!
:'''Luka:''' What is this all about...
:'''Spectators:''' Luka, get off the stage! Off the stage! off the stage!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Everyone, please calm down... Coming up next is the warrior set to perform in this revenge play, the spokesperson for ARMS &mdash; Advanced Reinforced Mechanized Suit, the inheritor of Xianzhou's ancient martial arts, and the IPC's product ambassador &mdash; Shuojin!
:'''Audience:''' ...Isn't Mr. Shuojin a member of the traditional martial arts schools that oppose IPC? Why did he take on this mech endorsement?
:'''Audience:''' I remember seeing him livestream his skills, breaking IPC mechs with his bare hands. How is he endorsing the IPC's weapons now?
:'''Audience:''' I have no clue... How did these two end up on the same side? What's the deal with this?
:'''Shuojin:''' Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm!
:'''Shuojin:''' Some of you might find it odd to see me up here and think I'm just selling out for money, betraying the Xianzhou. But that's not true!
:'''Shuojin:''' When the IPC first approached me to endorse this mech, I refused! The Xianzhou's ancient martial arts I've practiced diligently are a legitimate intangible cultural heritage, whose effects in strengthening the body are a hundred times superior to those of mechs, a rare treasure of universal civilization!
:'''Audience:''' Why are you standing there? If you're being coerced, just blink quickly, Mr. Shuojin!
:'''Shuojin:''' Ahem, but you might not know that our martial arts tradition has a long-standing relationship with IPC mechs.
:'''Shuojin:''' So, you might wonder, how do Xianzhou ancient martial arts connect with the IPC? Well, this story goes back to over two thousand years ago. Historical records show that the Intelligentsia Guild was once invited to help the Xianzhou during the Denizens of Abundance Wars...
:'''Shuojin:''' Back then, the wise men of the Intelligentsia Guild modeled their creations after the Xianzhou's aurumaton, crafting thirteen sets of powered armor and meticulously refining aurumaton combat techniques to aid the Xianzhou &mdash; this is the origin of the martial arts I practice.
:'''Shuojin:''' Regrettably, over the years, this tale of allies has been forgotten. This is why I'm here today, to restore and bring back history. The Interastral Peace Corporation's mechs are also treasures of Xianzhou ancient martial arts!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Who would have thought the IPC's powered armor has such a deep connection with the Xianzhou...
:'''Audience:''' The IPC's mechs and your martial arts share the same roots? Why didn't you mention this before? Did the IPC's money help you remember?
:'''Audience:''' And you're telling us this now? How are you going to face us, your longtime supporters, Shuojin!?
:'''Audience:''' Shuojin, scram! Shuojin, scram! Shuojin, scram!
:'''Shuojin:''' Everyone, calm down! To prove that my words aren't empty, today I will put on this armor and demonstrate for all of you. Let's see if my every move seamlessly matches with this IPC armor!
:'''Shuojin:''' Ladies and gentlemen! In the previous Wardance, I lost to Luka from Belobog by a narrow margin! Coincidentally, he is here today, and I boldly challenge him again. Luka, would you be willing to teach me a move or two once more?
:'''Luka:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could this be arranged by Miss Topaz?
::You look around but can't find Miss Topaz.
::Luka, don't accept his challenge...
::'''Luka:''' If I accept his challenge and lose, he'll regain his honor from his previous defeat in the ring...
::'''Luka:''' But if I refuse his challenge, I'll likely earn infamy for fleeing the ring without a fight, which Shuojin will surely use as propaganda.
::Bring it on!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Luka, don't accept his challenge...
::'''Luka:''' If I accept his challenge and lose, he'll regain his honor from his previous defeat in the ring...
::'''Luka:''' But if I refuse his challenge, I'll likely earn infamy for fleeing the ring without a fight, which Shuojin will surely use as propaganda.
::Bring it on!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bring it on!
:'''Luka:''' Well said. If you refuse his challenge, you might gain infamy for fleeing the ring, and Shuojin would use it as propaganda.
:'''Luka:''' Is this Miss Topaz's way of solving problems? She's handed me the opportunity, and I need to grasp it firmly.

:'''Topaz:''' Welcome, both of you. Luka, I'm glad you could overlook the public scrutiny and join us for the event.
:'''Topaz:''' The launch event is about to start.
:As powerful music plays, the host sways onto the stage.
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Ladies, gentlemen, elders, and community members! Whether the Luofu has a day-night cycle &mdash; good morning, good afternoon, and good evening! I'm your favorite host, Owlbert!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' The recent match between Luka and Shuojin likely left many spectators feeling outraged. How could the honorable and brave Shuojin lose to the cunning and deceptive Luka? It's simply too much to bear!
:'''Audience:''' Down with Luka! Avenge Shuojin!
:'''Spectators:''' Avenge! Avenge! Avenge!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' So today, under my arrangement, a rematch has been organized specifically for Shuojin. The target, of course, is the notorious Luka "Strongarm"!
:'''Luka:''' What is this all about...
:'''Spectators:''' Luka, get off the stage! Off the stage! off the stage!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Everyone, please calm down... Coming up next is the warrior set to perform in this revenge play, the spokesperson for ARMS &mdash; Advanced Reinforced Mechanized Suit, the inheritor of Xianzhou's ancient martial arts, and the IPC's product ambassador &mdash; Shuojin!
:'''Audience:''' ...Isn't Mr. Shuojin a member of the traditional martial arts schools that oppose IPC? Why did he take on this mech endorsement?
:'''Audience:''' I remember seeing him livestream his skills, breaking IPC mechs with his bare hands. How is he endorsing the IPC's weapons now?
:'''Audience:''' I have no clue... How did these two end up on the same side? What's the deal with this?
:'''Shuojin:''' Ladies and gentlemen, please remain calm!
:'''Shuojin:''' Some of you might find it odd to see me up here and think I'm just selling out for money, betraying the Xianzhou. But that's not true!
:'''Shuojin:''' When the IPC first approached me to endorse this mech, I refused! The Xianzhou's ancient martial arts I've practiced diligently are a legitimate intangible cultural heritage, whose effects in strengthening the body are a hundred times superior to those of mechs, a rare treasure of universal civilization!
:'''Audience:''' Why are you standing there? If you're being coerced, just blink quickly, Mr. Shuojin!
:'''Shuojin:''' Ahem, but you might not know that our martial arts tradition has a long-standing relationship with IPC mechs.
:'''Shuojin:''' So, you might wonder, how do Xianzhou ancient martial arts connect with the IPC? Well, this story goes back to over two thousand years ago. Historical records show that the Intelligentsia Guild was once invited to help the Xianzhou during the Denizens of Abundance Wars...
:'''Shuojin:''' Back then, the wise men of the Intelligentsia Guild modeled their creations after the Xianzhou's aurumaton, crafting thirteen sets of powered armor and meticulously refining aurumaton combat techniques to aid the Xianzhou &mdash; this is the origin of the martial arts I practice.
:'''Shuojin:''' Regrettably, over the years, this tale of allies has been forgotten. This is why I'm here today, to restore and bring back history. The Interastral Peace Corporation's mechs are also treasures of Xianzhou ancient martial arts!
:'''Owlbert (Remote Puppet):''' Who would have thought the IPC's powered armor has such a deep connection with the Xianzhou...
:'''Audience:''' The IPC's mechs and your martial arts share the same roots? Why didn't you mention this before? Did the IPC's money help you remember?
:'''Audience:''' And you're telling us this now? How are you going to face us, your longtime supporters, Shuojin!?
:'''Audience:''' Shuojin, scram! Shuojin, scram! Shuojin, scram!
:'''Shuojin:''' Everyone, calm down! To prove that my words aren't empty, today I will put on this armor and demonstrate for all of you. Let's see if my every move seamlessly matches with this IPC armor!
:'''Shuojin:''' Ladies and gentlemen! In the previous Wardance, I lost to Luka from Belobog by a narrow margin! Coincidentally, he is here today, and I boldly challenge him again. Luka, would you be willing to teach me a move or two once more?
:'''Luka:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could this be arranged by Miss Topaz?
::You look around but can't find Miss Topaz.
::Luka, don't accept his challenge...
::'''Luka:''' If I accept his challenge and lose, he'll regain his honor from his previous defeat in the ring...
::'''Luka:''' But if I refuse his challenge, I'll likely earn infamy for fleeing the ring without a fight, which Shuojin will surely use as propaganda.
::Bring it on!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Luka, don't accept his challenge...
::'''Luka:''' If I accept his challenge and lose, he'll regain his honor from his previous defeat in the ring...
::'''Luka:''' But if I refuse his challenge, I'll likely earn infamy for fleeing the ring without a fight, which Shuojin will surely use as propaganda.
::Bring it on!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bring it on!
:'''Luka:''' Well said. If you refuse his challenge, you might gain infamy for fleeing the ring, and Shuojin would use it as propaganda.
:'''Luka:''' Is this Miss Topaz's way of solving problems? She's handed me the opportunity, and I need to grasp it firmly.

:'''Carmella:''' This invitational match was truly perilous... If it weren't for Miss Topaz's intervention, who knows what it could have turned into?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We owe her a big thank-you.
::'''Luka:''' Yes, I must also do my best to fight harder. After all, having taken their money, I need to do my part in promoting their products.
::The IPC's methods are quite frightening...
::'''Luka:''' They seem scary, but if you think about it, not so much.
::'''Luka:''' Miss Topaz's plan, though seemingly malevolent, is a cunning strategy that targets the unworthy, not the noble. If Shuojin were a person of integrity, this tactic wouldn't have lured him into the trap.
::Miss Topaz is betting on both sides.
