:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 184 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 184 f.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Perfect timing, (Trailblazer). Now that the Wardance has ended and Luka has returned to Belobog, it's time for me to go.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you stay for a couple more days and enjoy yourself?
::{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 185.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Haha, how am I going to afford that? Besides, Mr. Owlbert's been urging me to go back and write the next script of ''Keeping Up With Star Rail'' for him.
::Will you be able to get that permanent position you're after?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you be able to get that permanent position you're after?
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 186.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' I hope so, haha, but Mr. Owlbert keeps saying that I still lack experience, so I guess I'll have to gain more experience for a while longer.
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 187.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Honestly speaking, these days of participating in the Wardance with you have been the happiest of my life.
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 188.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Now that Luka is the hottest rising star in the whole cosmos, he'll definitely have lots of chances to participate in major tournaments in the future.
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 189.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' When the time comes, I hope you'll still be his coach, and I'll still be in charge of covering your stories.
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 190.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' By the way, this is the issue of the newspaper that features the showdown between Luka and Yanqing. I bought 100 copies. This one's for you to keep.
:{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 191.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Oh, no! It's getting late, I'm about to miss my starskiff! I should get going! I'll see you next time!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll make sure Luka becomes the champion next time!
::{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 192.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Of course! It's just a matter of time before he becomes the most dazzling champion in the cosmos. I've got a knack for reading people!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll be the contestant myself next time.
::{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 193.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Hahahaha, that works too. Luka can be your coach then!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about you be a contestant yourself next time?
::{{A|VO side2 yanwu camera 194.ogg}} '''Carmella:''' Haha! Oh, no no, you might as well just give me three punches and end me now!
