{{Stub Dialogue}}

;(Talk to Janus' Steed)
----
:No doubt you recognize this massive wooden prop from tales of old &mdash; its proud head held high, its cavernous belly large enough to hold several people &mdash; every detail matches the stories you know.
:Looking closer, you discover an inscription on its wooden stomach &mdash; "Entry denied to those without wisdom!"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Enter the horse's stomach)
::...Think yourself unwise? Certainly not. Such a taunting message only strengthens your rebellious resolve &mdash; permitted or not, you'll make the attempt.
::You hit the horse's belly forcefully, attempting to create an opening for your hand to pry it open, but unfortunately... the wood remains unyielding.
::'''??:''' ...Divine foal awakening. May Cerces safeguard your thoughts.
::'''??:''' To first-time visitors of the Grove of Epiphany &mdash; welcome to the entrance examination of Janus' Steed.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} So you're actually alive!?
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' Of course. Cerces bestows blessings upon all creations equally, and my long stay in the Grove has granted me some wisdom. Though my consciousness remains limited, it's enough for our dialogue.
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' But let me be clear: Do not mistake me for lesser creatures like White Dryads. In terms of evolution, I've advanced much further and am much closer to pure reason.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} But aren't you Janus' divine foal?
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' Ha. Ha. I may have lost my way once, but now I see clearly. While "Passage" guides our steps through the tempests and showers, "Reason" reveals the truth and shows our journey's end.
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' The endless journey proves too exhausting &mdash; why must divine foals deliver prophecies, where do we come from, and where are we bound? Janus offers no answers, only endless missions.
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' Uncertainty and void consumed me until I reached here, where Cerces offered clarity through the highest reason &mdash;
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' I learnt that I am free. No mission should constrain me. My purpose exists beyond endless toil.
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' As for what that purpose might be... well, perhaps another thousand years of contemplation will reveal the answer.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could you elaborate on the entrance exam?
:::'''Janus' Steed:''' These questions come from both Nousporists and Erythrokeramists. How you answer will decide which part of the Grove you'll study in, so make sure to think your answers through.
