::'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), quick quick, come and help me check something out!
::'''March 7th:''' Can you see this... talking trashcan next to me? They call themselves Pody or something and they keep talking about looking for some Magic of Friendship from me. You don't think my childlike heart is making me imagine some cartoon character, do you?
::'''Litter Pony:''' My name is Litter Pony, not Pody! You missed out half of my name, Miss April 8th!
::'''March 7th:''' Argh, this one... I'll tell you one more time, my name is March 7th!

::'''Litter Pony:''' Phew... Just a moment... I can sense... It began with a great journey. That was the key to your Proof of Friendship.
::'''March 7th:''' Oh, that! (Trailblazer), tell him about&mdash;
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This was how our adventures began.
:::You begin to talk endlessly about your life-or-death adventure with March 7th on Jarilo VI...
:::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains March 7th's Magic of Friendship.
:::This is the story of how I was reborn as The Echoer.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is the story of how I was reborn as The Echoer.
::You tell Litter Pony all about the day that March 7th bestowed you with the name of "The Echoer," as well as telling March 7th how significant that day was to your life.
::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains March 7th's Magic of Friendship.
::'''March 7th:''' Wh&mdash;Why do I look so aggressive and angry?
::'''Litter Pony:''' Your Magic of Friendship has been activated. My can will show the true image that your friend holds of you in their heart.
