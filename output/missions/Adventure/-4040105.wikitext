:'''Public Property Protector:''' Hey, you!
:<!--1-second delay-->

:'''Public Property Protector:''' I got you now!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who are you?
::'''Public Property Protector:''' ...I am an honorable Silvermane Guard and a righteous servant to the people of Belobog!
::'''Public Property Protector:''' I caught you redhanded, you vandal! Under my sworn oath as a Silvermane Guard, I shall carry out proper justice!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I... I give up...
::'''Public Property Protector:''' What? Did you just give up without knowing what you did?
::'''Public Property Protector:''' You won't get off that easy, vandal! You will taste the iron fist of justice!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just trying to stay in shape...
::'''Public Property Protector:''' Are you trying to reason with me?
::'''Public Property Protector:''' You should know, for every supply vessel you break, that's three hours of overtime for someone in the restricted zone to replace it...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What I do is my right and it's none of your business!
:::'''Public Property Protector:''' Backtalking, are you? Guess I got to put some hurting on you...
:::'''Public Property Protector:''' We'll show you the price to pay for damaging public property in the restricted zone! Get 'em!
:::<!--1-second delay-->

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sorry. I was wrong.
:::'''Public Property Protector:''' If apologies worked, we wouldn't need Silvermane Guards! I must show you how serious this is. Yeah, how serious!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine. I admit I'm a repeat offender.
::::'''Public Property Protector:''' I knew all that apologizing was an act!
::::'''Public Property Protector:''' We'll show you the price to pay for damaging public property in the restricted zone! Get 'em!

::::'''Public Property Protector:''' Uh, I...
::::'''Public Property Protector:''' ...Ahem, you're the first one to apologize so sincerely. I guess I, uh... can let you go this time.
::::'''Public Property Protector:''' ...But know this &mdash; no vandals will be tolerated!
::::'''Public Property Protector:''' All right, you may leave now. The restricted zone is not a hangout.
::::<!--1-second delay-->
::::----
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't these things renew themselves?
::'''Public Property Protector:''' Renew? Are you from another world?

:'''Public Property Protector:''' You... You're pretty tough for a vandal!
:'''Public Property Protector:''' I can't even protect the most basic infrastructure... I've brought shame to Captain Dunn!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I broke the vessels to preserve peace.
::'''Public Property Protector:''' You got to be something else to say that with a straight face!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Captain Dunn isn't a match for me, either.
::'''Public Property Protector:''' You fought Captain Dunn? No wonder... How can a soldier like me beat someone even the captain couldn't defeat? You're way above my league...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one can stop me! No one!
::'''Public Property Protector:''' How I can lose to someone who relishes in the destruction of public property?
:'''Public Property Protector:''' Oh, forget it. I can't beat you, so do what you will...
:'''Public Property Protector:''' But I'll be back one day to avenge the broken supply vessel. Just you wait!
