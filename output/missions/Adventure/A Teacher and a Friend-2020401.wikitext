===Head to the Artisanship Commission and find Qingque{{subst:void|<!--202040102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|Qingque from the Divination Commission has been sent by the master diviner to assess the site post-disaster and seems to have run into some troubles that are "beyond her scope of work," requiring your help.<br />Speaking of, what is Qingque's scope of work? Isn't it to oversee the repository?}}

===Look for Master Ryan's manuscript in the Sapientia Academe{{subst:void|<!--202040103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|After understanding what plagues Chengjie, Qingque and you decide to help him out with recovering his master's manuscript.<br />Chengjie didn't want to go back to the Sapientia Academe because he didn't want to bother the Cloud Knights for something small like this... Do you feel angry at the way he didn't want to bother the Cloud Knights but is so nonchalant about bothering you?}}

===Find the correct manuscript from the variety of manuscripts{{subst:void|<!--202040105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|Neither you nor Qingque is familiar with the manuscripts in the Artisanship Commission. Better to bring along all the manuscripts you can find before identifying the right one.<br />You flip the pages like a clueless investor picking flaws in a designer's work. It feels good.}}

===Hand the damaged manuscript to Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|You managed to find Master Ryan's manuscript, but a sudden ambush damaged it.<br />However, what else could you have done? At least there were several complete pages left. Hand them all to Chengjie, at least you would've completed the task.}}

===Bring a dejected Chengjie to Starskiff Haven to clear his mind{{subst:void|<!--202040109-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Unable to deal with the loss, Chengjie sank into a state of despair. You and Qingque, being the good-natured people that you are, decided to bring Chengjie to have a walk.<br />Many people walk through Starskiff Haven daily. It can be a good place to calm down a bit... Then again, if you have social anxiety, being here may actually make you more anxious.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Chengjie evidently did not have the mood to do anything else other than watch starskiffs. So let's go starskiff-watching on the bridge of the Xianzhou Luofu.<br />Starskiff Haven sees many starskiffs in a day. What kind of starskiffs does Chengjie want to see?}}

===Hand the IPC Designer Invite to Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040111-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Obviously, Chengjie didn't know about the invitation the Interastral Peace Corporation extended to Master Ryan, and Master Ryan never told him.<br />You wonder if the invitation letter would cause more guilt to Chengjie. However, if you don't hand it over, it might cause you to feel guilty as well.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|Chengjie wanted to witness the birth of starskiffs with his own eyes at Stargazer Navalia, where monsters currently roam. Luckily for him, combat is your forte, so he asked you along...<br />You kind of wish people would pay more attention to your talents, those beautiful aspects of you, and not just "you can fight."}}
