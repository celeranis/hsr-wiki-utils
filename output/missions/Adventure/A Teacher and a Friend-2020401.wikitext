:'''Qingque:''' You're here!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Heard you've got some problems you'd like a hand with?
:'''Qingque:''' It's not so much a problem for me, as it is for this guy... Since Master Chengjie is here now, maybe he can talk about it himself?
:'''Chengjie:''' I'm just a young apprentice who cannot graduate, so I'm not qualified yet to lead any team. Please don't call me "Master."
:'''Qingque:''' I'm just saying it for convenience's sake. Don't worry about it, Chengjie.
:'''Chengjie:''' Ah, I remember you. You are the great hero Master Gongshu mentioned. He said you helped him fight off all the monnn~stersss~ in the commission.
:'''Chengjie:''' I really envy you. I can't do anything. I'm just a piece of trash wasting my days away at the Artisanship Commission... Every time I come across something dangerous, I flee in fear. I'm such a chicken, and I've got no sense of ar~ti~san~ship~...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you so self-pitying all of a sudden?
::'''Chengjie:''' It's not sudden at all. I've been depressed ever since I found out that I lost my master's manuscript.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that what Master Gongshu told you?
::'''Chengjie:''' Master Gongshu didn't say anything to me, but I know he's thinking it deep down.
::'''Chengjie:''' If I were a true~ ar~ti~san~, then there's no way I could've lost my master's manuscript.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fear of death is pretty normal.
::'''Qingque:''' Yep. Like, seriously, what's more normal than being afraid to die?
::'''Chengjie:''' ...But I was doing just that, and still lost my master's manuscript. It is absolutely unforgivable.
:'''Chengjie:''' The manuscript is my master's legacy work of his lifetime, and it's the only copy in the whole cosmos.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} During his lifetime? Do you mean Master Gongshu is dead?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Legacy work? What happened to Master Gongshu?
:'''Chengjie:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Sir}}, please get hold of yourself. The one who passed away is Master Ryan, a craftsman who used to be my mentor when I first joined the Artisanship Commission. It's not my current teacher, Master Gongshu.
:'''Chengjie:''' *sigh* My master's manuscript should have gone down in Xianzhou's history... but I was too busy saving my own skin and didn't take it out with me. I really am utt~er~ly~ use~less~
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why didn't you make a copy of something so important?
::'''Chengjie:''' I feel even worse now!
::'''Qingque:''' Well, if I were in his shoes and didn't save or back up any of the Divination Commission's files, I wouldn't even dare to sleep.
::'''Chengjie:''' What you said is true, but it's too late for regrets. It's impossible to make a copy of it now.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Is this manuscript really that important?
::'''Chengjie:''' I am not very learned, and I've always felt intimidated and under-qualified to face this manuscript.
::'''Chengjie:''' That manuscript is Master Ryan's magnum opus. I thought that one day I'd be able to actualize its visions myself... But now I won't even get the chance to try.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just find that manuscript, and you'll be fine, right?
::'''Chengjie:''' But the Artisanship Commission is filled with uncontrolled ingenia, and abominations awakened by the Ambrosial Arbor... I dare not...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you'd like me to take over from here?
:::'''Chengjie:''' That's great, (Trailblazer). Are you really willing to help me find the lost manuscript?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Is this why you've invited me over, Qingque?
:::'''Qingque:''' Hmmm... I didn't expect things to turn out like this.
:::'''Qingque:''' Argh, don't mind me right now. Just help Chengjie find that manuscript.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see. If it's lost, it's lost.
:::'''Qingque:''' You're right. What's lost is lost.
:::'''Chengjie:''' ...Miss Qingque?
:::'''Qingque:''' But! (Trailblazer) has fought off the Abominations of Abundance before, recovered the Creation Furnace, and became a hero at the Artisanship Commission. Helping Chengjie find that manuscript should be a piece of cake that you'd never refuse, right?
:::'''Qingque:''' Right? Right? Riiight?
::'''Chengjie:''' ...Miss Qingque, are we pushing it too far?
::'''Qingque:''' Just let the right people handle the right things. Besides, it's too dangerous for you to go back alone.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I agree, but only on one condition.
:::'''Qingque:''' What condition?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You must come with me.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't even think about slacking off this time.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm out. Ask someone else to help.
:::'''Qingque:''' Hey, let's talk this out instead of throwing in the towel, okay?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not unless Qingque comes with me.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not fair if you are the only one who gets to slack off.
::'''Chengjie:''' Miss Qingque, I'm begging you!
::'''Qingque:''' Well, so much for my lazy day plans. Anyways, got any leads on the manuscript? Those manuscript thingies all seem identical to me.
::'''Chengjie:''' After Master Ryan passed, his manuscripts were packed away by the Artisanship Commission. It should be placed in the Sapientia Academe.
::'''Chengjie:''' My master's dream was to create a starskiff that nobody's ever seen before. There should be words like "Starskiff designs," "keel structure," "Starskiff engine" on his manuscript.
::'''Qingque:''' That's enough for us. If you keep using more of these fancy words, we ain't gonna understand anything. Let's just head out, (Trailblazer).

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This has nothing to do with you being a craftsman.
::'''Chengjie:''' But every time I pick up my tools, I can only think of my master teaching me these artisan skills. And as soon as I think of these skills, I'll remember that I lost his final manuscript. I&mdash;I can't go on like this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sorry about this accident.

:'''Qingque:''' ((Trailblazer), we can't let him be depressed like this. Say something, or I'll start feeling guilty.)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should complete the missing parts of the manuscript.
::'''Chengjie:''' No! Asking me to fill my master's shoes would be like asking a toddler to duplicate the most famous art piece in the world.
::'''Qingque:''' *sigh* If I'm in low spirits at work, I'll simply pick out a wide open space to take a wee stroll.
::'''Qingque:''' How about this? Let's put the manuscript aside and pick up the mood at Starskiff Haven, huh?
::'''Chengjie:''' I can't stay at the Artisanship Commission anymore. I'm homeless, and it doesn't matter where I go.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Forget about the manuscript for now. Let's take a break!
::'''Qingque:''' Yes, yes. Let's go to Starskiff Haven. There's good food, fun stuff, and lots of people there.

:'''Chengjie:''' Starskiffs should be a familiar sight for all Xianzhou citizens.
:'''Chengjie:''' I crisscrossed the skies on skiffs every day, watching the buildings on either side rush by, just like they have for a hundred years.
:'''Chengjie:''' Lots of Xianzhou people are just like me, who never really thought about "the cleverness and technological advancements behind the starskiff." We just took it for granted and thoughtlessly enjoyed its convenience.
:'''Chengjie:''' "Good design is practical, and the more practical it is, the harder it is to be appreciated," is what my master always said. He's loved starskiffs dearly his whole life, and hoped to build an even better model.
:'''Chengjie:''' I should have been a starskiff designer myself. But my grades were too low, and before I could even finish studying, my master passed away. And now, I can't even protect the manuscript that he's left behind...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That manuscript is all that's left of your bond.
::'''Chengjie:''' You think too highly of me. I don't dare see myself as that important... If anything, the manuscript is what's left of my master's bond with the Xianzhou.

::'''Chengjie:''' It's a shame that Master Ryan's brilliant but short life didn't allow him to see his final ideas come to fruition. I feel really sad about it. I want to make his last dream a reality and leave a mark for him in the history of Xianzhou.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You and your master seem really close.
::'''Chengjie:''' No... Master Ryan was always so nice to me, but my level was technically never good enough to be his apprentice &mdash; I lacked the talent and was too lazy, but he still never cast me aside.
::'''Chengjie:''' All I felt was powerlessness and regret when confronted by the genius of his work after his passing. I hated that I wasted my apprenticeship, not knowing how to carry out my master's final designs.
:'''Chengjie:''' *sigh* We've only had twenty years of apprenticeship between us, and it's all gone so fast.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Twenty years! You've been learning from him for that long?
::'''Chengjie:''' Twenty odd years &mdash;Almost a quarter of a short-life species' existence, but on Xianzhou it's far too short. Master Gongshu took care of disciples for several hundred years, and his disciples have now taken on disciples of their own.
::'''Chengjie:''' Just like that, before I knew it, my master had passed away... It's been almost a hundred years now. I still don't have the courage to face his manuscript. And now...

:'''Qingque:''' This giant water tank holds... seeds?
:'''Chengjie:''' It's not a water tank, but a starskiff incubator. It's filled with a culture medium that supports the starskiff seed during the germination phase, and it can ensure the biological material grows in a nutritious and controllable environment.
:'''Qingque:''' This is the first time I've ever heard about this. (Trailblazer), you got any questions there?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Starskiff seeds?
::'''Chengjie:''' Yup, as the name suggests, it's a seed that can grow into a starskiff. But it's not a seed that grows into a plant-like structure. It incorporates moldable metals, biological materials, jade abaci, and more.
::'''Chengjie:''' All of the growth data for a starskiff is stored inside its seed. In other words, these seeds come with their own "design manuscripts," and each seed grows step-by-step based on the design plan.
::'''Chengjie:''' In the absence of any external stimulus and with sufficient nutrition, a starskiff seed will grow into a keel in one go.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Culture medium?
::'''Chengjie:''' Generally speaking, the ratio of catalyzers in the culture medium is fixed. However, it can be adjusted based on the design of the ship. Depending on the composition ratio, the strength and growth speed of the hull will vary.
::'''Chengjie:''' So there are craftsmen from the Artisanship Commission who specialize in researching the ratio needed for the culture medium during the germination phase, so as to make the ship lighter, more durable, and safer.
::'''Chengjie:''' There are many cylindrical "culture medium injectors" at various phases along the starskiff assembly line to make fine-tuned adjustments to it as it grows.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Germination phase?
::'''Chengjie:''' There are four main stages in the growth of a starskiff: The germination phase, the embryonic phase, the nutritive phase, and the forming phase. What you're seeing right now is the germination phase.
::'''Chengjie:''' During this phase, materials such as fallow earth and Ligneous Freeroamers inside the starskiff seed will form the earliest signs of seed germ and embryo.
::'''Chengjie:''' If anything goes wrong during the growth process, we need to clear out the failed starskiff seed and destroy the biological matter in the metal frame.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Starskiffs grow out of seeds?
::'''Qingque:''' That's what made me most curious, too. Every day I'll be catching one of these starskiffs, without knowing that it's actually been grown from a seed.
::'''Chengjie:''' You must have heard of the legends of the Ambrosial Arbor, right? That's what brought about a technological revolution on Xianzhou. Especially the Alchemy Commission, they had an utterly miraculous technology...
::'''Chengjie:''' But after Reignbow severed the Ambrosial Arbor, most of the tech was lost. However, this starskiff growing technology was retained.
::'''Chengjie:''' Help me take a photo of this incubator. Then we can go check out the embryonic phase.

:'''Qingque:''' It's like I can already see the form of a starskiff taking shape... They really do grow out of seeds into a ship!
:'''Chengjie:''' Even though I've read about it a thousand times, I still feel a sense of the incredible in the face of such wonder.
:'''Chengjie:''' The embryonic phase is the most important stage in shaping the starskiff. If you don't regulate the temperature and culture medium properly, or if the design data has any errors, then the starskiff seed will fail to grow as designed.
:'''Qingque:''' That is to say, during this phase, there's still a possibility of chucking out a failed seed?
:'''Chengjie:''' That's right. Some fast-growing anomalies can even burst through the incubator, causing the culture medium to leak out. When that happens, the incubator basically just gets trashed.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} A trashed incubator?
::'''Chengjie:''' Despite the confidence in their own designs, even our craftsmen have their failures.
::'''Chengjie:''' Check out that incubator over there. Its designer must've miscalculated the self-growth algorithm of Fallow Earth... If I want to complete these designs, I need to focus on these growth patterns of starskiffs.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Has any serious accident ever happened before?
::'''Chengjie:''' I heard Master Gongshu talk about how Stargazer Navalia was attacked by some Elixir Seekers before.
::'''Chengjie:''' Rumor has it, they got a sample of the Ambrosial Arbor and hoped to use some starskiff culture medium to grow a new Ambrosial Arbor of their own. However, they were actually getting the wool pulled over their eyes! It was actually just a bonsai tree from the Alchemy Commission.
::'''Chengjie:''' When they dropped their bonsai cutting into the culture medium, it was like detonating a bomb &mdash; in a flash, their hideaway had a massive tree burst through the roof, causing the whole building to collapse.
::'''Chengjie:''' That massive tree spent the next few seconds withering before dying off. And that small twig gained incredible vitality within seconds, and then exhausted all life within a few more seconds. It really was a terrifying phenomenon.

::'''Chengjie:''' Mmm, you can't actually see the core part of a starskiff that has taken form. For one thing, the starskiff seeds develop a detailed and complex root system during subsequent phases, which also acts as the internal jade abacus network aboard each starskiff.
::'''Chengjie:''' For another thing, the toughest biological materials on the exterior will gradually close up, so that the starskiff can continue its core internal operations even when it encounters severe impacts.

:'''Chengjie:''' I've actually been quite uneasy during the whole of our journey to Stargazer Navalia.
:'''Chengjie:''' Can I really design starskiffs? Can I really fulfill my master's dream? Or am I just looking for some kind of escape from reality?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're overthinking this.
::'''Qingque:''' Yeah, when I first met you, I could feel the heaviness of your burden. Please take it easy.
::'''Chengjie:''' Thank you, Miss Qingque. I'm not overthinking everything anymore. I just want to go back right away and help complete my master's manuscript.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you still uneasy?
::'''Chengjie:''' No, I'm better now.
::'''Chengjie:''' I just want to go back right away and help complete my master's manuscript.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This trip doesn't seem to be helpful for a craftsman, though.
::'''Qingque:''' Ha, you don't sugarcoat things, do you?
::'''Chengjie:''' You're right. I doubted myself before coming here. Since my knowledge about every step of the starskiff manufacturing process is top-notch, was it really necessary to come here to take a look at things for myself?
::'''Chengjie:''' But luckily, I'm here. I've got my motivation back, and now all I can think about is completing my master's manuscript as soon as I can.
:'''Chengjie:''' From that moment on, I've been constantly wondering, is there anything that can transcend the confines of time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A masterpiece!
::'''Chengjie:''' That's what I was thinking, too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A world-changing idea!
::'''Qingque:''' Chengjie, have you got any of those world-changing ideas up there?
::'''Chengjie:''' ...Unfortunately, I don't. And I don't think my master does, either.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The passing down of knowledge?
::'''Qingque:''' Makes sense. If you take on an apprentice, and then that apprentice takes on their own apprentice... Wouldn't that transcend time?
::'''Chengjie:''' That's actually a pretty good idea, but I haven't reached the level of being able to take on an apprentice yet.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing.
::'''Qingque:''' ...You're even more of a pessimist than I am.
:'''Chengjie:''' My master's manuscript has never been published before. Once finished, I trust it will become a masterpiece that transcends the confines of time.
:'''Chengjie:''' My master spent so much time and effort on teaching me, on igniting my passions... He gave me all his time, the most precious thing for a short-lived being. So I have to repay him in kind.
:'''Chengjie:''' I want to prove that the time he's spent was not wasted. That his time spent will flow on through me, and that it will flow on through his surviving works.
:'''Chengjie:''' Just look: Every day, there are so many starskiffs leaving Stargazer Navalia. One day, I'll build my master's dreamship, push it out gently, and set it sailing in the busiest lane of Starskiff Haven!
:'''Chengjie:''' When that day comes, I'll be a real graduate! And my master will approve of me, I'm sure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go for it, get it done!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Time to walk the walk, then.
::'''Chengjie:''' Don't worry. I'm filled with motivation now. Once I get back, I'll go all out.
:'''Qingque:''' Well, then, how about you keep an eye on him, (Trailblazer)...
:'''Chengjie:''' Please, (Trailblazer) &mdash; please supervise me until I'm done!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll be looking for you back at the Commission soon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As long as it's not too much of a hassle...
:'''Chengjie:''' I feel like I'm filled with motivation now. Once I get back, I'll go all out. I'm off, then. Thanks again to both of you for all your help!
:'''Qingque:''' Finally, that's resolved. Thank you so much. I'm exhausted, so I'll go back now too. Talk to you later.
