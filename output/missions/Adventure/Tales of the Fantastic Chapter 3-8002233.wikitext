:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' This Star-Shattering Blade of Truth is a divine artifact once wielded by Dan Feng during the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' It is said that "A Sword Is Mightier When Hidden." He, therefore, hid the Ignis Aureliae away, from potential thieves before he was imprisoned.
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Fortunately, I still retain memories from my previous lives, and can dimly recall that Dan Feng has hidden a map somewhere deep in the Alchemy Commission that shows where the Ignis Aureliae is. Perhaps we can find this, and the treasure will be practically revealed to us.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me guess, it's treasure huntin' time, innit?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't fetch quest a bit overused?
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' So what? Interastral Peace Entertainment has shot over sixty films in the Allen Jones treasure-hunting franchise. Treasure hunts are family-friendly fun!

:'''Mr. Xiyan:''' Phantylia assumed dispatching crack troops would be enough to win. Little did it know that today, (Trailblazer) had the high elder's support and was far stronger than before. The Antimatter Legion was routed before long, and utterly annihilated without a trace.
:'''Mr. Xiyan:''' With a flick of his sleeve, the high elder elegantly moved his hands like billowing clouds, as if communicating telepathically with the huge elixir crucible before him. A strange light burst forth from the crucible (by the way, this is where the VFX artists can add some Immersia special effects), and a lump of molten brilliance coalesced like condensation forming in the air &mdash;
