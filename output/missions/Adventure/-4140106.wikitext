::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Hey, you over there!
::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' That was an uncivilized action! Come, we're going to hand you in!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...And who are you?
:::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Can you not see this badge? I am the IPC vanguard of civilization, the guardian of the people of this land!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...This old trick again?
:::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Oh? So you're a repeat offender... I will show you how severe a crime disrupting civilization truly is!
::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' This is the venue for the Interastral Tournament Festival. I would not allow you to even kick a billboard, let alone smash a vessel!
::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Your actions have destroyed the order of the venue and hindered the progress of the event, while also generating an extremely negative influence on the people's lives!
::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Think about it. How much effort do you think it takes for the volunteers to move these vessels into the venue every day? How much time will they spend cleaning up the mess you've made...
::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' In the name of civilization and the IPC, I will reprimand you!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it too late to apologize?
:::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Apologize? If apologies served a purpose, do you think we'd have lawyers? You must pay for your uncivilized actions!
:::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' You have a choice. You will either pay a fine that will go towards local construction efforts, or you will be locked up and confined as an example of negative behavior for others to learn from.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright, I'll pay.
::::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Are you sure? This money is worth two months of my wages. Are you sure you want to donate it to the local area?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, I'm sure.
:::::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Ahem... Well, actually, as an IPC worker, I do not actually have the right to fine you...
:::::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Given your sincere attitude, I will let you off this time. However, if I catch you again, I'll make sure I fix you up properly!
:::::'''Guardian of Civilization:''' Also, if you really want to make a contribution to the local construction effort, why don't you go and check out the Pillars of Creation? Make sure you wear a safety helmet!
