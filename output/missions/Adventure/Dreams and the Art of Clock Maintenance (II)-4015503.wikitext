After fixing them, you receive a strange text message. Life isn't a late-night or even teen drama, so you're utterly baffled. However, why not check out the "secret room" with the "hidden gift"? Who knows, maybe you really are the main character?}}

:'''Medical Department Ticker:''' Ah, it's you, our honored guest. You came at the right time. I've been speaking with my colleagues an&mdash;
:'''Entertainment Department Ticker:''' Colleagues? We're the Formidable Four of the airship! Titles are not to be changed lightly!
:'''Food & Beverage Department Ticker:''' Oh, hush now! Have you any inkling the gravity of our situation? With the Boss in their current state, now's no time to be fussing over titles!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Formidable Four?
::'''Entertainment Department Ticker:''' We four make half the contribution that keeps this airship running, got it? We work for the Boss, who not only oversees the whole airship but also finds time to tweak our calibration while they're at it.
::'''Medical Department Ticker:''' Uh-huh, once we're fully operational on our own, each of us will head a department and work together to keep the airship running smoothly.
::Enough chatter. Can we get to the point?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Enough chatter. Can we get to the point?
:'''Housekeeping Department Ticker:''' Exactly! Without the Boss, there is no Formidable Four! The Boss's safety has to be our top priority!
:'''Housekeeping Department Ticker:''' Long story short, for reasons unknown, our Boss became severely injured, and now they're down for the count. That's why we were so out of it earlier, as if we'd lost our hands.
:'''Medical Department Ticker:''' Now that you've fixed us four, do you think you could help our Boss as well? I can patch up scrapes and scratches, but I'm simply out of my depth with serious injuries like this.
:'''Food & Beverage Department Ticker:''' Yeah, we're not sure how exactly you pulled it off, but we really need your help!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright. I'll give it a shot.
:'''Medical Department Ticker:''' Thank you so much!
