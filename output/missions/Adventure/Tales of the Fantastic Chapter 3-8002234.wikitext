:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' It's been a rough journey, (Trailblazer). But now that everything's in hand, we can start with the business of forging this Star-Shattering Blade of Truth...
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' There are three conditions we need to meet in order to forge this divine weapon, and the sacred materials we have collected so far only count as one. (Trailblazer), do you know what the other two are?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Some random worldbuilding rules you just made up...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Some screenwriting nonsense...
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Xiyan, is this {{MC|f=girl|m=boy}} going to be okay on set? Totally unprofessional.
:'''Mr. Xiyan:''' It's ok, my old friend. This esteemed guest has rescued the Luofu, and naturally, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} is no ordinary layperson. After all, all heroes have a bit of an ego.
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Alright, let's continue. The two other conditions needed to create the divine weapon are right here in our Artisanship Commission. As they say, you need the right tools for the job. Without the smelting equipment and Bona Aqua here, creating a divine weapon would be impossible!
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' As for the last condition, it's about how we forge the weapon. Fortunately, I still have memories from my previous life to serve us...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you remember everything, doesn't that mean you're basically Dan Feng?
::'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Let's put aside for the time being the profound philosophical concept of "Who Am I?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there anything that can't happen in this story?
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' The forging process for the divine weapon is like this. Just listen to me &mdash;
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' "Heaven Rains Aqua Vitae, Flames Forge Veritas Aureliae. Aether Tilts Askew, Arbor Sprouts Anew. Root Bathes in Empyreal Dew, Iron Grows With Ephemeral Hue. Blade Shatters Starscape, Jade Eclipses Agroshade."
:'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Did you get all that?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} How about you give an explanation?
::'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' What that means is, first add the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Bona Aqua}}, then add the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Ignis Aureliae}}. When the Bona Aqua has completely evaporated, add {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|coolant}}. After it has completely cooled, put in the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|hilt-wood from the Arbor}}, then add more {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Bona Aqua}} to fuse the hilt with the metal into a single instrument, as though they have always been one.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This verse doesn't rhyme that perfectly...
::'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Hey, that's pretty picky... I didn't write this part anyway, so take up any criticism about the poetry with the author.
::'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Got it? Next, go to the depths of the Artisanship Commission and use this formula to forge the weapon.
::----
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I understand...
::'''(Dan Heng/Cold Dragon Young/High Elder MK2000/John Doe):''' Got it? Next, go to the depths of the Artisanship Commission and use this formula to forge the weapon.

:'''Mr. Xiyan:''' "(Star-Shattering Blade of Truth/Big Sword/Reaper of Nexus Modder/Imaginary Intra-Kinetic Portable Tactical Laser Cannon), reborn once more, settled in (Trailblazer)'s hand &mdash; who suddenly felt invincible."
