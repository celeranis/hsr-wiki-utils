:'''Screwllum:''' "Dear {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)." Screwllum's figure appears, and he gives a deep bow. "I was originally intending to write a code that collects The Doctor's Robe, property of Dr. Primitive, #64 of the Society. I hoped to use that to lure him into appearing in the Simulated Universe. However, the erroneous code generated the Robe of The Beauty instead... and then a wondrous chemical reaction occurred with the Cosmic Fragments."
:'''Screwllum:''' "Fact: I am still unable to comprehend the connection between the Beauty and Cosmic Fragments." Screwllum is extremely polite. "Conclusion: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cosmic Fragments are expanding endlessly}}."
