:{{DIcon|?}} Projector
:It looks like high-beam lights used on set, but it could also be an old-fashioned projecting device. You're not sure what it is.
:You notice a conspicuous button on its body. You decide to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Press it with conviction.
::You press the button, but the lens-like component doesn't light up like you expected it to.
::Maybe the machine is just for show. You begin to wonder whether this conclusion your natural powers of deduction brought you to is correct.
::As your mind works overtime, you hear rapid footsteps and the sound of ragged breathing approaching.
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Never mind. I'll stop fiddling with it.

:'''Family Attendant:''' Would you like to use the projector?
:'''Family Attendant:''' H&mdash;Hello! *huff* *huff* Are you here to use the projector?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Slow down and catch your breath first.
::'''Family Attendant:''' Whew...
::'''Family Attendant:''' Thanks, I feel much better now. Sorry about that, I haven't been getting much exercise lately. Didn't expect to wear myself out from such a short run. How embarrassing.
::Uh-huh. What movies do you have?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uh-huh. What movies do you have?
:'''Family Attendant:''' Movies? I'm sorry, but this projector doesn't play movies.
:'''Family Attendant:''' Allow me to explain: This device here isn't your average projector. It doesn't play movies. Instead, it displays a segment of the user's memories.
:'''Family Attendant:''' If you'll look over here, this is where blank compressed dream bubbles are loaded. Just place your hand here and wonderful moments from your past will be saved into the dream bubbles.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Penacony never fails to impress.
::'''Family Attendant:''' Indeed. This projector is a hot commodity even in Penacony.
::That sounds fascinating. Let me try!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That sounds fascinating. Let me try!
:'''Family Attendant:''' Certainly. I've loaded a compressed dream bubble. You can&mdash;
:'''Family Attendant:''' Ah, I almost forgot to mention this, but we can only do one projection currently. Manufacturing compressed dream bubbles is a highly demanding process, so there's only a limited supply available. We only have one bubble left now. The rest will take time to ship.
:'''Family Attendant:''' Are you sure you want to use it alone? This is normally the family screening room. Even the sofa is made to fit more than five people.
:'''Family Attendant:''' This opportunity doesn't come by often. Would you like to invite any guests to watch the memories with you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes! Send the invites to 'em all!

:'''Family Attendant:''' Which guests on board would you like to invite? I'll send for them right away.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does it have to be a guest on board?
::'''Family Attendant:''' Oh, my apologies. I'd assumed the friends you'd like to invite were also on board. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.
::You're able to get into contact with them?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're able to get into contact with them?
:'''Family Attendant:''' Uh... Only if they're also on board the airship. If not... I'm afraid my abilities are limited.
:'''Family Attendant:''' My apologies, I should've taken that into account. If the guests you wish to invite are still in Penacony, please get in touch with them first. Once you're sure of whom to invite, I'll submit the guest list to the airship's front desk.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon}} Invite the entire Astral Express crew!
::You send an invitation to "The Astral Express Family" group chat.

::{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Invite Firefly!
::You dial Firefly's number, only to hear a cold robotic voice: This person is currently outside of the service area.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Invite your friends from the IPC!
::You think of Aventurine whom you met in Penacony and decide to call him. His status, however, indicates that he's "in a meeting," and the "Do Not Disturb" feature automatically ends the call.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Invite Sparkle!
::You think of a certain Masked Fool who made your Trailblazing expedition in Penacony a great deal more dangerous after you two met.

:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Invite your Penaconian friends!
::You have befriended several Penaconians since your arrival. Inviting them for a luxurious experience on board the airship seems like a pretty nice idea.

:'''March 7th:''' Where is it? Where is it? Do we use this thing here to watch the movie?
:'''Family Attendant:''' Allow me to explain...
:The attendant explains to the Nameless how the projector works and the relevant things to take note of.
:'''Welt:''' ...The mechanics of this projector seem rather similar to the technology used by the Garden of Recollection.
:'''Family Attendant:''' To start the projection, just press your palm gently against the compressed dream bubble loaded within.
:'''Family Attendant:''' If there's nothing else, I'll take my leave now. Please enjoy yourselves. Feel free to call for me anytime if you need me. I'll be right outside.
:'''March 7th:''' It's their last one, (Trailblazer). Have you thought about what you're gonna put inside?
:'''March 7th:''' Don't put too much nightmarish stuff, though! I doubt I can handle that.
:'''Himeko:''' Hmm, a compressed dream bubble. I don't think the choice of projected content is necessarily within (Trailblazer)'s control.
:'''March 7th:''' But what if it plays something (Trailblazer) doesn't want anyone to see? Th&mdash;That would be so embarrassing!
:'''Welt:''' The projector has a few settings for the projection. You can likely control what the dream bubble shows with them.
:'''March 7th:''' Alright, then. Well, just give me a holler if there's something I shouldn't see, (Trailblazer). I'll shut my eyes immediately!
:'''Himeko:''' Hmm, we should leave the controls to (Trailblazer). {{MC|f=She|m=He}} would know best what to show us.
:March 7th, Himeko, and Welt smile at you, and Himeko gestures for you to begin.
:You decide to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just do it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Touch it cautiously.

:March 7th, Himeko, and Welt smile at you, and Himeko gestures for you to begin.
:You decide to...
:Just do it!
:Touch it cautiously.
:You place your palm against the back of the projector, in close contact with the compressed dream bubble. Chaotic memories flood your mind...
:A memory from the past is projected vividly...
:As the scene unfolds, you see yourself standing in front of your companions, holding the lance you acquired in Belobog. Your eyes are filled with resolve.
:You're stunned. Did that sensation of warmth come from your lance, your companions from the Astral Express, or from the woman whose blade could slice through the night sky &mdash; Acheron? You don't know. You only know that the warmth was there while your heart was racing.
:'''Welt:''' ...I am still very curious about Miss Acheron's power.
:'''Himeko:''' It's rare to see March with such a serious expression.
:'''March 7th:''' It was a really dangerous moment. Even though Himeko and Mr. Yang were there, I didn't dare let my guard down. I can be reliable when I need to be!
:'''March 7th:''' Although looking back now... That's weird. How come we're looking at (Trailblazer)'s memory in the third person's perspective?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I enabled video recording from my phone!
::'''March 7th:''' Don't be silly, (Trailblazer)!
::...I don't know either.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I don't know either.
:'''Himeko:''' How strange.
:'''Himeko:''' But this is Penacony. It could be a technique unique to The Family.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon}} A deeply terrifying memory.

::You think it over and decide for the sake of your own privacy not to expose your personal life to your companions. You decide to maintain some sense of dignity for yourself.
::You can't tell what is real and what is fake in this magnificent Dreamscape, but no matter what happens, your companions will always be by your side. That's enough for you.
::And so, you decide not to think about it anymore.
::'''Welt:''' It seems that (Trailblazer) has matured more than we had realized and is much more independent now.
::'''March 7th:''' What a pity! I was too engrossed just now and forgot to take a picture to commemorate the moment! This is a big movie with (Trailblazer) in the leading role, right? In that case, it'd be too bad if we don't take a photo with the star of the movie!
::'''March 7th:''' If only we had a compressed dream bubble. I wouldn't be bored with such an exciting moment, no matter how many times they're replayed!
::'''Himeko:''' Precious memories should only be viewed once because it's not good to overindulge in such things. March, how about we look toward the future, instead?
::'''Himeko:''' (Trailblazer)... This applies to you, as well.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry, I'll listen to your advice.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ahh, such is the spirit of trailblazing!
::Himeko gently smiles at you in affirmation. You feel as though she has high expectations of you.
