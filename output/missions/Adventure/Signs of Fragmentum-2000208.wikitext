;(Talk to Security Department Member)
:'''Security Department Member:''' The extent of Fragmentum corrosion in this zone is very severe, and even the terminal devices recently broke. Establishing a remote connection is the only way to go, but that requires beacon data...
:'''Security Department Member:''' Are you (Trailblazer)? I guess you're sent here by Lead Researcher Asta. Awesome! Please do us a favor and collect data from the beacons inside. Please!
:'''Security Department Member:''' It's quite dangerous in there... But if you're ready, just let me know.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go.
