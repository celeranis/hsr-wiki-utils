::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where's the closing ceremony up to?
:::'''March 7th:''' Mr. Reca just finished his closing speech. They're giving out the awards now!
:::You really got all dressed up?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You really got all dressed up?
::'''March 7th:''' This is an important event, so I've got to take it seriously! And I went through so much trouble to buy this dress. It'd be a waste if I only wore it once.
::'''March 7th:''' Shh, they're about to announce the last batch of awards!
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Next up is the final award of this photography exhibition &mdash; the Best New Artist award.
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Allow me to declare the name of our winner: The Nameless from the Astral Express, Miss (March 7th/Say~Cheese~/)!
::'''March 7th:''' Heyheyheyyyyy! Wowowow!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's totally tongue-tied...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Deep breaths. Watch your expressions!
::'''Mr. Reca:''' If the magic of movies is using a moving lens to capture the flow of space and time, then photography is using a stationary lens to freeze moments of captivation.
