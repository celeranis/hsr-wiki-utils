{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Parlor Car|update|Dear Nameless,<br /><br />Thank you for boarding the Astral Express and setting off on this journey among the stars and across the cosmic ocean with us. The Cosmos used to be silent and stagnant until your presence helped us illuminate the stars and cause beautiful things to occur.<br /><br />In this time and space, please look up at the starry sky and see those faint, flickering lights in the deep darkness. We are born on the ground, yet we know deep down that the vast and endless starry sky is our true home.<br /><br />May this journey lead us starward.<br /><br /><div align="right">Yours Faithfully, Shush</div>}}
