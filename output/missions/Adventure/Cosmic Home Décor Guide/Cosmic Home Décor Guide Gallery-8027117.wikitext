:'''Dan Heng:''' The collection room isn't small. It can hold a lot of memorabilia. But without the habit of keeping it tidy, even the largest space will gradually fill up with clutter.

:Teach me, Master Dan Heng!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Master Dan Heng, three-time reigning Hygiene Star of the Express! I asked you here today to learn your secrets for organization!
:'''Dan Heng:''' The fundamental issue with organization is how to categorize things. It's quite similar to conducting scientific research.
:'''Dan Heng:''' Just like how the Astral Ecology School advocates creating a comprehensive chart of the evolution of cosmic life based on similarities and evolution of characteristics. In contrast, the Candelagraphos advocates organizing all knowledge into an encyclopedia according to the initial letters.
:'''Dan Heng:''' (Trailblazer), which one do you prefer?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Based on characteristics.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Figurines belong with figurines, posters belong with posters!
::'''Dan Heng:''' It's the same when I'm organizing entries in the data bank.
::By alphabetical order.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' It would be great if the real world had a one-click sorting feature.
::'''Dan Heng:''' I use the same method when organizing my collection of books.
::Based on mood.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Based on mood.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I'm from the Go-With-the-Flow School.
:'''Dan Heng:''' That fits perfectly with what I imagined about you.
:'''Dan Heng:''' However, I think if this collection room becomes too neat and orderly, it might lose some of its lived-in feel and start to resemble a showroom from a real estate agent.

;(Talk to Dan Heng)
:'''Dan Heng:''' Arranging collectibles is best done as you please. A Nameless's life is always full of fatigue, so why not give yourself a break on these small matters?
