:At the entrance of the station, there are a bunch of aggressive IPC employees surrounding a Pepeshi boy.
:'''Popott:''' H&mdash;Hold up! I haven't thought this through yet...
:'''IPC Executive:''' Stop hesitating, Mr. Popott. This is the best opportunity in the whole universe for you! Do you want to control your fate at Interastral Peace Entertainment, or do you want to remain as a Family puppet for the rest of your life?
:'''Popott:''' I...
:'''IPC Security Guard:''' Let's go and stop wasting the leader's time! His hourly rate is much higher than the price of your show ticket!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait!
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::'''IPC Executive:''' I can't afford to wait anymore. I have a meeting coming up in four and a half system hours...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't touch him!
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::'''IPC Executive:''' I didn't lay a finger on him. Please don't question my professionalism...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How high is your hourly rate, exactly?
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::<!--0.5-second delay-->
::'''IPC Executive:''' That's confidential. The employee handbook strictly prohibits the disclosure of our salary...
:'''IPC Executive:''' Wait a minute. Who are you?
:'''IPC Security Guard:''' Mr. Popott, do you know this person?
:'''Popott:''' Nope. I've never met {{MC|m=him|f=her}}...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your manager asked me to find you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Forla has something to say to you
:'''Popott:''' Madam Forla? Hmph, I've got nothing to say to her!
:'''IPC Executive:''' Looks like our future artist isn't too keen to talk to you. Please leave.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me have a few more words with him...
::'''IPC Security Guard:''' What's wrong with you? Can't you understand the leader?
::'''IPC Executive:''' Hey, don't make a spectacle out of yourself on The Family's turf! The Interastral Peace Entertainment represents the IPC's reputation!
::'''IPC Security Guard:''' Yes...
::'''IPC Executive:''' {{MC|m=Sir|f=Madam}}, please tell me more about you. I'll see whether your title is worth my time.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm a Trailblazer from the Astral Express.
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Oh? This is the first time I've met someone from the Astral Express.
:::'''IPC Executive:''' I know the Nameless are famous for meddling in other people's businesses... but as your "trailblazing" is crucial for IPC's prosperity, I respect what you do.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the hero who saved Jarilo-VI.
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Jarilo... I see! Were you the Nameless who helped that icy planet to end the Eternal Freeze?
:::'''IPC Executive:''' I heard that place is protected by the Architects. In this case, you can count as a friend who had contributed to Preservation.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm a good friend of Clockie!
:::'''IPC Security Guard:''' Um, leader, I think there's something wrong with this person's head.
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Hahaha, this is interesting. I wonder why the Iris Family sent a nutcase here to deliver their message.
::'''IPC Executive:''' Spill it now. My rude subordinate here will take the rap for my subpar work efficiency today.
::'''IPC Security Guard:''' Huh!?
::'''Popott:''' ...
::'''Popott:''' Well, speak up now. What did Madam Forla want you to say?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She admits that she's wrong.
:::'''Popott:''' She's wrong? Hahaha, no. I don't think she is.
:::'''Popott:''' I think she's right. I'm indeed better off being an adorable mascot who enjoys the cheers of my fans onstage during variety shows. That's an easier path to stardom for me...
:::'''Popott:''' However, she's never thought that... maybe that's not the kind of star I want to be.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She made a new career plan for you.
:::'''Popott:''' New career plan... She still likes to promise people the moon, doesn't she?
:::'''Popott:''' That's how she lured me into signing for her company back then. She told me to take the roles in those cheesy teen movies first while waiting for better opportunities to come along.
:::'''Popott:''' But I'm a Pepeshi, not a long-life species. I don't have much time to wait.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's doing it for your career and your own good.
:::'''Popott:''' I know.
:::'''Popott:''' I've never felt that she doesn't care about my future. On the contrary, she really wants me to have a successful career and make her proud.
:::'''Popott:''' But she doesn't understand that some things matter more to me than my career.
::'''Popott:''' The sole reason that I joined the Iris Family is to be a comedian. I enjoy making people laugh, not making them blush and scream for me... I've told her this many times.
::'''Popott:''' Now, the Interastral Peace Entertainment has offered me a chance in Epsilon to act in a movie that I truly love. Please tell Madam Forla that I'll no longer subject myself to the whims of the Iris Family. I want to be the director of my own life!
::'''IPC Executive:''' Well said! Everyone should be the director of their own life!
::'''IPC Executive:''' That manager from The Family is so unkind... I believe Mr. Popott will make it big with his determination to achieve his dream, regardless of compensation! His dreamchasing spirit is why I picked him!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're such a good person.
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Thanks for your compliment. Respecting talents is our fundamental value at the IPC.
:::'''IPC Security Guard:''' Are you sure? How come I'm getting either a pay cut or a KPI deduction every other day...?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You really think that?
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Of course! Mr. Popott looks a tad cute, but who said you can't be a comedian when you're cute?
:::'''IPC Executive:''' If you ask me, I'd say that Madam Forla is only treating her talents as tools. She only cares about how much she can earn from her employees, instead of listening to what her employees really want. That's saddening!
:::'''IPC Security Guard:''' Can somebody listen to what I really want, too? I joined this company to be a martial art actor...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The key is "regardless of compensation," no?
:::'''IPC Executive:''' Th&mdash;This shows Mr. Popott's determination and perseverance! Even if he says so, can the esteemed Interastral Peace Entertainment really mistreat him?
:::'''IPC Security Guard:''' That's hard to say...
::'''IPC Executive:''' {{Size|28|Ahem!}}
::'''IPC Executive:''' Mr. Popott, are you ready to come with me?
::'''Popott:''' Yes, I've thought it all through. I'm ready to get on board!
::'''IPC Executive:''' Look, this Pepeshi has made his decision &mdash; and what a brilliant decision. Don't worry, I'll make sure he has a bright future ahead of him.
::'''IPC Executive:''' Since we're leaving Penacony, you can keep these as compensation for poaching your talent. Don't let an artist with such great potential go next time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I won't leave until everything is sorted!
::'''IPC Executive:''' Tsk, I didn't expect there would be such brusque and unreasonable people like you on this extravagant planet of dreams.
::'''IPC Executive:''' Hey, you. Stop {{MC|f=her|m=him}} from bothering me and Mr. Popott, and be careful not to turn this into a scene. I don't want to draw The Family's attention.
::'''IPC Security Guard:''' No problem! Just leave it to me!

:'''Forla:''' Comedies... Himemia Films... Tsk, that's not our strong suit. How can I get Popott an opportunity in that area...?
::'''Forla:''' Please, kind guest. Please help me find Popott. I'll make sure he's satisfied.

::'''Forla:''' P&mdash;Popott! I'm sorry for my harsh remark earlier. Please take a look at this new proposal...
::'''Forla:''' ...Eh? Dear guest, where's Popott?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's gone.
:::'''Forla:''' I see... Well, it was me who drove him away.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sorry for failing to make him stay...
:::'''Forla:''' There's no need to feel bad... It's kind enough of you to offer your help.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's all right!
:::'''Forla:''' You... Fine, I get it. Seems like my effort to make amends has gone down the drain.
::'''Forla:''' Alas, Popott, if only I could understand you earlier. My arrogance has deprived a young man of a bright future and the universe of a future superstar.
::'''Forla:''' I've messed up too badly to continue calling myself a celebrity agent. Perhaps I really should give up on this career...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He'll still be an actor.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's just joined Interastral Peace Entertainment.
::'''Forla:''' R&mdash;Really? That's great!
::'''Forla:''' I'm happy as long as he keeps pursuing his dream. If he gave up because of me, my fluff ball would be filled with guilt forever.
::'''Forla:''' It's a shame that I can no longer help him in his pursuit. I'll probably regret it for the rest of my life.
::'''Forla:''' However, there are still many other artists under my management. Some aspire to become models despite having average looks, some are good-looking but dream of becoming idols with an unconventional style, while some compose niche music but yearn to be worldwide popular singers...
::'''Forla:''' From now on, I'll stop dampening other people's dreams! *Pepeshi vulgar word*! I'll forget about the target audience, The Family's benefits, or making universal superstars! Instead, I'll become the firewood that nurtures the first sparks of their dreams to atone for my past arrogance!
