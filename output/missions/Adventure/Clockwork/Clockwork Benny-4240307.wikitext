;(Talk to Woolsey)
:{{A|VO vo ambient w3 greeting woolsey 101 calm.ogg}} {{A|VO vo ambient w3 greeting woolsey 102 calm.ogg}} '''Woolsey:''' Don't worry about accidents &mdash; The Family will protect each and every guest.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you think about the Dream's Edge project?
:'''Woolsey:''' Hmm...
:'''Woolsey:''' With all due respect, that entire project... lacks imagination.
:'''Woolsey:''' From the way I see it, their Dreamweavers seem to follow a fixed formula when they work. When it's supposed to be a creative process, they may look more like they are solving a geometric problem.
:'''Woolsey:''' That's not the deal-breaker. What truly makes me sick is...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it?
:'''Woolsey:''' ...Their obsession with doors.
:'''Woolsey:''' You'll get what I mean when you visit the place. Doors are everywhere in the city! You have to pass through a door to enter a building, cross a pedestrian bridge, and access the rooftop garden.
:'''Woolsey:''' What's the reason behind the obsession? I'm puzzled. If no one cares to explain, I'll take it as a sign of incompetence.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please give it a score out of ten.
:'''Woolsey:''' Hmm...
:'''Woolsey:''' I'll give it a... seven. It isn't too harsh and is fair.
:'''Woolsey:''' I've been told that the team used to produce many critically acclaimed virtual reality projects back then. Who knows? Some people might be drawn to it.

;(Talk to Benny)
:'''Benny:''' The mission is yours, buddy! I need a fresh face to gather information for me, as I want to find out how The Family values our work.
:'''Benny:''' If possible, I'd like them to rate our work... It's up to you who you want to approach. Don't worry, as anyone who holds a position in The Family should have already been here and tried what we have to offer.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've collected the ratings from some Family members.
:'''Benny:''' You're so reliable, buddy! I knew I could trust you!
:'''Benny:''' Now, tell me everything. Let me see what they think of my project.
:'''Benny:''' ...
:'''Benny:''' Seven... Seven!?
:'''Benny:''' ...Are you sure the scores come from the bottom of their hearts? You didn't say anything that swayed their opinions, did you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why would I want to do that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't pin this on me...
:'''Benny:''' This is outrageous... I can't accept it!
:'''Benny:''' Look at the ridiculous things they said about my project! My team and I are so committed to this project. Why can't they just be grateful for what we've done?

:'''Benny:''' Who made this comment? Mediocre!? Does she even know anything about the industry? We're making something ahead of this era here. She should improve her tastes before making any comments!
:'''Benny:''' What does this guy mean about Miracle Benjamin being more of a gimmick than substance?
:'''Benny:''' It's downright nonsense! Is he accusing us of false advertising? We mean everything we include in the advertisement. He's welcome to come here and count whether there are indeed a thousand buildings here!
:'''Benny:''' We're obsessed with doors? What kind of a comment is that? Is it a joke? How about he remove all the doors in his house and see whether it makes his life better?
:'''Benny:''' These two-faced scumbags from The Family! They greet us with smiling faces but criticize us behind our backs...
:'''Benny:''' They can humiliate me, but they mustn't disrespect my team and our hard work! That would be crossing the line!
:'''Benny:''' No way. I need to talk to them and sort things out. Why can't they speak up forthrightly if there's something they aren't happy with? Are they secretly waiting to see me making a fool out of myself? Have they forgotten this is also their project?
:'''Benny:''' Thank you so much, buddy. If it weren't for your help, I might have been kept in the dark until the day I delivered the project. Please keep these tokens of my appreciation.
