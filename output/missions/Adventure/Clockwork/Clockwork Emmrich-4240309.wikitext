;(Talk to Confused Car Owner)
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' What the...? I just pressed the button on my remote control, but why is my car not responding at all?
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' Hold on, what's this? Indefinite Patent Operative Omnifier... What kind of nonsense is this?
:'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... Greetings, vehicle owner. The accessories in your "Steinway Falcon" luxury speedster might be infringing on some patents.
:'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... To protect the rights of patent creators, a mandatory lock has been put on your "Steinway Falcon" luxury speedster. Please don't worry. The lock will be automatically unlocked once the infringement risk is resolved!
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' Wh&mdash;What!? No way! This is my speedster! I paid a fortune for it!
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' You're just a useless piece of paper! I'll just rip you...
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' Wh&mdash;What? I can't rip it up!? What kind of sorcery is this?
:'''Confused Car Owner:''' No! Y&mdash;You can't do this to me! I promised Catherine that I'd take her for a ride in the Golden Hour today! You... you are... you... Aaarrrggghhh!

;(Talk to Alarmed Bloodhound)
:'''Alarmed Bloodhound:''' So, is this the telescope that went haywire?
:'''Troubled Bloodhound:''' Obviously. Didn't you see the note taped to it? Indefinite Patent Operative Omnifier?... What kind of new trickery is this?
:'''Troubled Bloodhound:''' Those Dreamchasers just won't stop causing trouble... Can't they just peacefully enjoy their life in this dream?
:'''Alarmed Bloodhound:''' I'll... rip it off...
:'''Alarmed Bloodhound:''' ...Hmm, I can't rip it off. It doesn't seem to be an ordinary note. Maybe we should report it?
:'''Troubled Bloodhound:''' ...You want to disturb the family head over such a small matter? Think again...
:'''Alarmed Bloodhound:''' What will happen if these notes start appearing everywhere like a bad rash? It's better safe than sorry...

:You have no idea what this "Zappy Gun" is supposed to do... although it does sound a bit questionable.
:But anyway, you're not planning on buying these weird toys anyway. Just finish Emmrich's task.

::'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... Initiating infringement risk analysis...
::'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... Analysis complete! Object identified: A sales billboard.
::'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... Conclusion: The analyses regarding the raw materials, supply chain, and related technologies show no risk of infringement.
::'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... Current risk: The billboard is advertising Mr. Emmrich's invention, and he's currently in a dispute with his distributor over the sales share.
::'''Patent Operative Omnifier:''' *Beep*... To ensure Mr. Emmrich's rights as the inventor, a mandatory lock will now be put on the sales billboard. The lock will be automatically unlocked once the infringement risk is resolved!
::The billboard is not making sounds anymore, and it's making you feel bad. You can't believe you went to such lengths for that selfish inventor.
::You feel a mix of emotions. Maybe you should stay for a while to witness others' reactions... or just walk away.

:'''Diamond Doll Salesman:''' We're billboards, man! We don't have "empathy"!
:'''Diamond Doll Salesman:''' And besides, that billboard was not promoting your competitor's product or messing with your business! Of course you can just play the good guy!
