:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Excuse me, emergency!
:'''Anna:''' As you say, that gentleman's indeed in a bit of a pickle... But right now I...
:'''Carl:''' Oh... Oh, that's fine. You go on.
:'''Anna:''' Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Carl. I'll double-check everything then and call you once I get back.

:'''Carl:''' You know what... He used to be the most important person in my life &mdash; he shared his research results with me without hesitation and led me along the correct Path of Erudition.
:'''Carl:''' But how could someone like that somehow become so stubborn now?
:'''Carl:''' You know what? The attitude he showed when judging my research results was like lecturing an underperforming child!

:'''Chabro:''' ...
:'''Anna:''' That old guy is really something. I can't believe he has projected his "consciousness" into an "entity"...
:'''Chabro:''' ...I&mdash;I'm sorry...
:'''Anna:''' But that's fine. Now that the negative emotions have all been "physically" cleared away, the old chap won't have any more problems.
:'''Anna:''' I'll be off then. Mr. Carl is still waiting for me. Oh yes, thanks very much for that just then. I'll have to treat you to a good meal next time!

:'''Chabro:''' ...*Ahem*... A&mdash;Anyway, sorry for any trouble caused this time around. If you have any problems later on, you can come and find me.
:'''Chabro:''' I'm more or less a respectable enough old chap, and should be able to help you out with a few things still.
