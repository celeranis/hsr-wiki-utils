:'''IV:''' ...You're here, after all. Didn't I tell you... Eh? How come you're alone!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't be upset.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who else do you expect to come here?
::'''IV:''' ...I... I... No, nothing. I mean it's good enough that you make it here...
:'''IV:''' Are you here to see me off, my friend? Do you feel the same way as I do...
:'''IV:''' There's no place for people like us, even though the world is vast. When we look back on our journey in Penacony, it will dawn upon us that we are nothing but some travelers without a place to belong...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't you have anything you'll miss?
::'''IV:''' ...You bet! My dream, my hard work along the way, and my achievements so far... They are my shackles, but I can't let them go no matter how hard I try.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But it's impossible to fall to your death in a dream.
::'''IV:''' Huh? Oh... I see you're trying to provoke me, but I won't fall for it!
:{{Black Screen|You carefully step forward, and the Pepeshi person shoots you a warning look, but doesn't seem to be stopping you.}}

:'''IV:''' Huh? Oh... I see you're trying to provoke me, but I won't fall for it!
:'''IV:''' I didn't want to stoop to the level of my colleagues who degraded and slandered me, and I've long mastered the skill to see the good in the negative remarks made about me, but this time...
:'''IV:''' I know they're jealous of me... They can say whatever they want about me, but I can't allow them to ruin my dream!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's all the more reason for you to cherish your life then!
::'''IV:''' You're right. I should strive for greater achievements to prove them wrong!
::'''IV:''' But you won't get it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go ahead and jump. Do a backflip if you can.
::'''IV:''' H&mdash;How can you have so little empathy!? I knew it! Everyone in this world is cold and mean!
::'''IV:''' People like you will never get it...
:{{Black Screen|You continue to move towards him, but the Pepeshi person is too absorbed in his own emotions to notice your movements.}}

:'''IV:''' I can't help breaking down every time I'm bombarded by insulting and scathing remarks in the middle of the night. Yet, I have to act like nothing is wrong the next day...
:'''IV:''' You know&mdash;Ahhhh! Help!!!
:The Pepeshi, who seems close to falling off the rooftop, flips his body in the nick of time and grabs your arm for dear life.
:He summons an astonishing amount of strength from his petite figure, leaving a circular red mark on your arm.
:'''IV:''' ...Phew... Th&mdash;That was scary... I almost died...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you calmed down now?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you still want to jump now?
:'''IV:''' ...After... going through... that narrow escape, I... phew... have had an epiphany on the true meaning of life.

;(Talk to IV)
:'''IV:''' Ah, I get it now... What's that saying again? Where there's life, there's hope!
:'''IV:''' Thank you so much for this valuable lesson, stranger! I won't ever slide into self-destruction again!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What have I taught you?
::'''IV:''' Well... let me think... Yes! You made me realize I should always try to "find a way out even though my life seems to be a drought"!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you come up with that saying yourself?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm surprised it rhymes.
::'''IV:''' Wh&mdash;Why are you being sarcastic? I'm expressing my gratitude to you. Can't you tell?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You clearly chickened out just now.
::'''IV:''' Wh&mdash;What are you talking about!? I'm expressing my gratitude to you. Can't you tell?
:'''IV:''' Forget it! I never expect you to fully understand my plight! The pressure of dealing with the boycott against me in the industry and my ungrateful employees is just too much sometimes...
:'''IV:''' This is exhausting! I understand I've chosen a challenging path for myself... I have to brave through numerous hurdles to get closer to my lofty ambition...
:'''IV:''' Now, I need to rest... Here, take this! Consider it a token of appreciation for being my lifesaver!
