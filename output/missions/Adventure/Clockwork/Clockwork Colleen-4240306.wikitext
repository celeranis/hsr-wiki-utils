;(Talk to Colleen)
:'''Colleen:''' Finally, it's stopped... Is that thing I want still there?
:'''Colleen:''' ...Is it just this one thing?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's all there was inside the trashcan.
::'''Colleen:''' That's not right. Let me see...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't read what's on it.
::'''Colleen:''' It might be encrypted. Let me see...
:'''Colleen:''' Kissing, washing, hide-and-seek... These sure are diverse.
:'''Colleen:''' ...Alright, I've restored the text on it. As agreed, I'll give you a copy to share.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} When am I going to get paid?
::'''Colleen:''' Relax. I'll pay you later. First, listen to the secret I'm about to tell you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why was the IPC bugging you?
::'''Colleen:''' Good question. Let me tell you why.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm off then.
::'''Colleen:''' Ah, relax. I've still got secrets to tell you, remember?
:'''Colleen:''' You know, I used to be a Nameless as well, before leaving to strike out on my own. You know all of this &mdash; but I omitted the contents of my solo journey.
:'''Colleen:''' Take a guess at what I've been up to for those years.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Working for the IPC?
::'''Colleen:''' Me, working for someone? Impossible, let alone for a large conglomerate like the IPC. In fact, I ended up giving them quite the headache...
::'''Colleen:''' After all, I am a pirate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you go back home and work the land?
::'''Colleen:''' Hah, that'd be a fate worse than now. Plus, a stable life doesn't suit a Nameless.
::'''Colleen:''' I may not be a Nameless any longer, but I've still got the spirit of adventure in my bones.
::'''Colleen:''' That's why I became a pirate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not going to do something bad, are you?
::'''Colleen:''' Bad? Perhaps, but that depends on your definition of "bad." However, most people do seem to find me bad...
::'''Colleen:''' After all, I am a pirate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aren't you a traveling merchant?
::'''Colleen:''' To other people, sure, but I feel like telling you the truth... That's just a convenient disguise.
::'''Colleen:''' Really, I'm a pirate.
:'''Colleen:''' I've robbed trade vessels, smuggled minerals, and sometimes even peddled precious cargo. But I did it not out of greed, but for the freedom of wayfaring... and to make a little money for traveling.
:'''Colleen:''' The IPC put out a small bounty for me on its official site. I'm guessing those two fools came here just for that... I thought some big shot had discovered me right at the start.
:'''Colleen:''' Don't worry. Everything I told you before is true: I was once a Nameless, and now I still yearn for adventure. I'm no different from any other traveling merchants, besides the bounty on my head.
:'''Colleen:''' As soon as I heard about Penacony, I knew that I had to come here. No matter the cost...
:'''Colleen:''' I'm an unfortunate soul, who never got to see the age of heroes trailblazing the universe. I've always been envious and jealous of the real Nameless ones...
:'''Colleen:''' But I know that I'm also really lucky. The curtain has yet to fall on the story of this era, and I still have the chance to take part in it and catch a glimpse of the secret treasure of the universe waiting there in the end of the adventure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Secret treasure of the universe?
:'''Colleen:''' This is my idea of Trailblaze. I think that there is some kind of precious treasure that exists at the end of all adventure that pays off all the effort you expend along the way.
:'''Colleen:''' What's the point of continuous exploration if you know you're not going to get anything in the end?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Exploration is the main reward, in and of itself.
::'''Colleen:''' ...That's a very Nameless answer from you. You still retain your ideals; that's okay.
::'''Colleen:''' Despite my ideals being far less glittery now, I still hope that ideal behavior can be rewarded.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds way too focused on material gains...
::'''Colleen:''' Sure, but it's vital to feel rewarded materially.
::'''Colleen:''' When we regard something as a guiding principle, the world will develop in whatever direction we pursue. People today tend to choose money &mdash; as they have for a long time.
::'''Colleen:''' From this perspective, what could stimulate people's desire for exploration more than a secret treasure at the edge of the universe?
:'''Colleen:''' Once I've solved the Watchmaker's riddle, I'm going to embark on an adventure of my own. And it could just be the final adventure of my life.
:'''Colleen:''' I'm going to look for him &mdash; not for money, but to stand before him and see how dazzling the so-called legend really is, and whether it's strong enough to melt even a rat in the gutter like myself.
:'''Colleen:''' And those guys who tried to sabotage me, thinking they could stop me by using dirty tricks... whether it's The Family or the IPC, one day, I'll make them pay!
:'''Colleen:''' {{Size|28|Even the maxims of the universe shall step aside before me!}}
:'''Colleen:''' Oh, by the way &mdash; here's the reward I promised. Hold onto that. Even a Nameless has to eat, just like the rest of the mortals.
:'''Colleen:''' When everything is done and dusted, let's meet up again at the end of the adventure.

:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Hey, don't think you're safe just because you have that device on you. IPC guards have plenty of ways to get in. Surrender now, for the sake of everyone!
:'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Dude, let's wait at the door and see how much that lady can keep up the smugness.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you two doing here?
:'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Where did this gray-haired {{MC|m=boy|f=girl}} come from?
:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Hey, don't be so rude to the patrons.
:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' We're staff from the IPC, and we're here in Penacony on vacation.
:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Last night, we met the woman in this room and discovered that she bore a striking resemblance to a fugitive on the IPC bounty hunt.
:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' For the sake of Penacony's safety, we planned to thoroughly investigate her and try to get a match from her genetic data... but as soon as we tried knocking on the door, we bounced off the repelling shield she'd installed.
:'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Hmph, she's obviously guilty! If she really is innocent, then why wouldn't she let us in?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There has to be some kind of misunderstanding here.
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Misunderstanding? All I know is that there's no misunderstanding about the bounty!
::Perhaps you've got the wrong person?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Even so, she must still submit to our investigations!
::Nobody would just let any stranger into their room...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps you've got the wrong person?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Even so, she must still submit to our investigations!
::Nobody would just let any stranger into their room...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nobody would just let any stranger into their room...
:'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' True... But that's no excuse for refusing to submit to an investigation!
:'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' If she really is a wanted suspect, then the two of us have pretty much defused a ticking time bomb for Penacony... while making a little bank on the side. And if she isn't, then it would all just be a false alarm. It's a guaranteed way to make a profit!
:'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' We'll flush her out today, for sure!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave this up to me.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' You? What are you going to do about it?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Speaking of which, you two want the money, right?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Money? Heh, you can say that again...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What gives you the authority to force someone else like that!?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' Well, do you have a better idea? Show us!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm interested in this person, too.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Really? Then we're competitors. I'm not gonna let you in on this cash cow that just fell into my lap!
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can give you money.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Really, how much is that?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 500 credits each.
:::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' 500 credits!?
:::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' *coughs* This amount is not bad, but it's still not enough to make us give up the investigation...
:::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' How about 1,000 credits each, and you promise to drop this entire thing?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a deal.
::::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' You're frank, I like that. Show me the money.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You dare to negotiate with me!?
::::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' (Whispering) Dude, this one's no pushover, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} might be someone important. Let's... not clash head-on.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 1000 credits each.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Would the IPC consider this an abuse of authority?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' (Whispering) Dude, we are here on vacation. Technically, we don't have the authority to force an investigation.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' (Whispering) I know. You don't have to tell me specifically in front of {{MC|m=him|f=her}}.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' *coughs* Although this investigation hasn't been reported to the HQ yet, the IPC will surely express support for our actions...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hilarious! The IPC is willing to risk a fallout with The Family for this?
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' Uh, I...
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' (Whispering) Dude, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} makes sense. The repercussions might be too risky for the higher-ups.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' (Whispering) I know. Can you please not undermine me again in front of {{MC|m=him|f=her}}?
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' O&mdash;Our behavior is in line with IPC values! What right do you outsiders have to talk like that?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} If something really does happen, can you two take responsibility?
::'''Agitated IPC Security Personnel:''' (Whispering) Dude, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} makes sense. We can't afford the risk of being the cause of fallout between the IPC and The Family.
::'''Astute IPC Field Personnel:''' I&mdash;I... *sigh*

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you okay?
