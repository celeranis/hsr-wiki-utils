:'''Florist Owner:''' And for you to specially make this trip... All you had to do was make a selection of your favored blooms and I would deliver them personally to you. My lowly shop is not worthy of your glorious presence!
:'''Tizocic II:''' It was just an excuse to come out for a stroll. You probably don't know &mdash; we imperials rarely get any opportunities to leave that labyrinthine hellhole.
:'''Florist Owner:''' Ahahaha... In any case, please call on me if you wish to buy anything, Your Highness!
:'''Tizocic II:''' My older brother has ascended the throne for more than two years, and our relationship has grown distant. If I gift him with spindleblooms that he used to love, I think he'd be happy?
:'''Florist Owner:''' We have plenty of spindleblooms in storage. I'll fetch as many as you wish.
:'''Florist Owner:''' It's just, spindleblooms are bargain-bin flowers for commoners. To present them to His Majesty, would that be somewhat...
:'''Tizocic II:''' It's fine. Spindleblooms will do just fine. Even if he's the Emperor, he's still my older brother. No one knows him better than I do.
:'''Florist Owner:''' Your wish is my command... I will prepare the arrangement immediately. Please wait a moment.
:'''Tizocic II:''' Take your time. We aren't in a hurry anyway.
:'''Tizocic II:''' The gift of flowers is mainly to let my brother think that I'm still his naive younger sister. That will make the discussion of many future matters much more amicable.
:'''Tizocic II:''' Giving him some flowers to cheer him up, and maybe he'll be willing to lift the tax levies on those poor folk along the frontier star districts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're really too naive...
::'''Tizocic II:''' No, I'm not. I just want His Majesty to think I am.
::It's a pretty adorable way of thinking.
::'''Tizocic II:''' Yes, that's exactly my goal &mdash; to remind His Majesty of how totally adorable his younger sister is!
::He's not a child, so he won't play into your hands.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's not a child, so he won't play into your hands.
:'''Tizocic II:''' But I am!
:'''Tizocic II:''' One must know the reason to move the heart. Those high officials have done this sort of stuff before, but none was able to move him. It probably wouldn't work either to verbally spar with him using facts and reason.
:'''Tizocic II:''' In the realm of governance, even children have their own weapons: They don't lie, plot, or vie for power &mdash; or at least that's how everyone thinks of them.
:'''Tizocic II:''' So when I skip in with a huge bouquet of spindleblooms, crying and wailing to beg him to remove tax levies, no one will think that it's an issue of governance, just an innocent desire of a little girl.
:'''Tizocic II:''' If the scene's reached that stage, and His Majesty still refuses to soften those people's hardships, the resulting pressure will surely be excruciatingly torturous for my silly older brother.
:'''Tizocic II:''' And, I know him... He may not care about the people, but he cares about what the history books will write about him.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've got some guts, girl.
::'''Tizocic II:''' Tee-hee! I was born into imperialty, after all. Just putting what I've learned and heard to practice.
::You're scary.

:'''Rebel:''' You're different from her in that you can be reasoned with... Which is why you should understand that we have to do this.
:'''Rebel:''' Tizocic II's rule must be ended. Not just for the imperial guards, but for the entire Pupsha Empire.
:'''Rebel:''' Help me understand, Gray Knight: You fight for righteousness, but why would you wholeheartedly serve such a tyrant?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She was not born cruel.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She wasn't like that when she was young.
:'''Rebel:''' Of course, certainly, no one is born a brutish beast... But...
:'''Rebel:''' To walk a tyrant's path, one does not need a cruel soul, just a weak heart.
:'''Rebel:''' You wish to die for blind loyalty? Or will you muster your courage and do the right thing for once?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My oath is unbreakable above all.
::'''Rebel:''' I understand. Draw your weapon, Gray Knight. It is my honor to fight you.
