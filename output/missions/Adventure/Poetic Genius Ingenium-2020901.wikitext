===Speak with Guangda{{subst:void|<!--202090101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|The duties of the Realm-Keeping Commission's orderlies are like bricks, to be moved wherever they are needed. The work of Guangda is not an easy one, and now he is worrying in front of the Realm-Keeping Commission chancery...<br />Out of goodwill, you can ask him if he needs help, but whether you will help is a different matter...}}

===Take a stroll in the Exalting Sanctum and take down the small advertisements{{subst:void|<!--202090138-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|The duties of the Realm-Keeping Commission often involve trivial things, and taking down small advertisements will not be the last of them. Since you accepted Guangda's milk tea, help him out with this task.<br />Sometimes, even an outworlder like you can't help but wonder, is the Realm-Keeping Commission really a commission?}}

===Follow the lost and found notice and find the owner, Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|According to the lost-and-found notice, the owner is "Cong, craftsman of the Artisanship Commission." Maybe you should ask him what happened.<br />The words "Big Reward" is written on the lost-and-found notice. For one who is brimming with the spirit of exploration such as yourself, you have to see what this big reward is, right?<br />Of course, the most important thing is that you have a willing heart to help others.}}

===Head to the Exalting Sanctum and find the Gloomy Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|The recovery of a Gloomy Poet sounds like a literary anecdote. Regrettably, what you are looking for is, in fact, a Baroumbrella ingenium.<br />According to Cong, he created different types of "Poetic Genius Ingenia" to write the most moving poem in the world. This is what they call "being your own miracle maker," right?<br />However, is there really such a thing as the most touching poem in the world?}}

===Reduce the "gloomy" emotional weight{{subst:void|<!--202090131-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|According to Cong, as long as the "gloomy" emotional weight is lowered, the Gloomy Poet can speak normally. Go ahead, easy does it.<br />If you have the skills of Clara or Serval, you might be able to transform this Gloomy Poet into a grumpy old man... Oh, forget it.<br />As long as its gloominess doesn't affect its daily life, it can be taken as its little quirk.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Talk to the Gloomy Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090132-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|You should have successfully lowered the "gloomy" emotional weight, and it should be able to speak normally. Give it a shot. You still have to bring it to Cong anyway.<br />You feel that Cong is a handful and the ingenia he made are also very troublesome. Moreover, what's coming up next thing will also be very problematic.<br />But you are someone who likes solving problems, that is the undeniable truth.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Bring the Gloomy Poet back to Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|You went to great lengths to reduce the emotional weight of the Gloomy Poet. Next up is bringing it back to Cong.<br />You've heard about the millions of people who suffer from depression. If only they were like Baroumbrellas, just needing a little adjustment of their emotional weights.<br />At least you understand now that emotions are sometimes beyond your control.}}

===Head to the Alchemy Commission and find the Borderland Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|According to the position of the Gloomy Poet, the Borderland Poet should currently be in the Alchemy Commission. Go and recover its Inspo Jade Abacus.<br />Cong said that he created different poets to write love poems, so does the Borderland Poet really write "love poems"?<br />Perhaps it's a love poem written to the Cloud Knights.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Trade blows with the Borderland Poet and ignite some inspiration{{subst:void|<!--202090106-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|The Borderland Poet said, "Draw the inspiration of poetry from the burning passion of combat!"<br />You understand the moment you see the Borderland Poet. Sooner or later, you must give it a thrashing.<br />The time is now.}}

===Respond to Cong's message{{subst:void|<!--202090107-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|Cong sent a message. Hurry up and check it out. It may be the position of the next poet.<br />Perhaps he's still bugging you about the progress? Are there still those who doubt your capabilities?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Head to Starskiff Haven and find the Graceful Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090108-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|According to the Gloomy Poet's location, the Graceful Poet is currently in Starskiff Haven. Go and recover its Inspo Jade Abacus.<br />The Borderland Poet had a career guarding the frontier, so the Graceful Poets won't just randomly take action, right?<br />I don't think anyone can really understand this kind of thing.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Collect parting scenes for inspiration{{subst:void|<!--202090136-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|People come and go on Xianzhou, so why worry about not having a touching parting? You are sensitive and can feel the sorrow of parting.<br />This may be related to situations you are familiar with. People always have to experience "parting," be it expected or not.}}

===Respond to Cong's message{{subst:void|<!--202090115-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Cong sent a message. Hurry up and check it out. It may be the position of the next poet.<br />Perhaps he's still bugging you about the progress? Are there still those who doubt your capabilities?}}

===Give the parting scene to the Graceful Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090137-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|You are very good at photographing these parting moments. Bring them to the Graceful Poet.<br />There are many forms of parting, but what worries people is always the "uncertain date of return."}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Head to the Exalting Sanctum and find the Metrical Poet{{subst:void|<!--202090116-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|According to Cong's clues, the Metrical Poet is currently in the Exalting Sanctum's Spare Time Book Shop. Go and recover its Inspo Jade Abacus.<br />As it turns out, Cong doesn't distinguish the ingenia according to the styles of poetry. Rather, it's just whatever first comes to his mind.<br />It doesn't matter, you'll get the job done.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Give the collected Inspo Jade Abaci to Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090117-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Give Cong the collected Inspo Jade Abaci so that he can create the best "Poetic Genius Ingenium" through "big data training."<br />Thinking about how much effort Cong has gone through just to write a respectable love poem, you can't help but feel a little exhausted.<br />Is this what it's like being a Xianzhou youth with too much free time?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Talk is cheap, you must show the Metrical Poet what you mean{{subst:void|<!--202090135-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|What era are we living in? You're still talking about those old forms? You have to show it what liberal poetry is like.<br />Maybe you can swing this bat around, I think that's called "Brutalist Poetry"!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to the Divination Commission and bear witness to Cong's confession{{subst:void|<!--202090118-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|Cong hopes that you can witness his successful confession to Jingzhai.<br />But first, he has to succeed. You have a hunch that Cong is approaching this a little too simplistically.<br />To be honest, if just a poem is enough for a successful confession, then all the rules of this world will certainly fall apart.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Catch up to Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090120-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|Cong fled, unsurprisingly. Anyway, let's catch up first.<br />Cong never really had any self-confidence. Perhaps he knew before he opened his mouth. Let's comfort him and let this blow over.<br />That aside, you haven't even received your "Big Reward" yet.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask Mingyue for more information{{subst:void|<!--202090121-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|As you feared, Cong never got to know Jingzhai serious and didn't even know what she really liked. You have no choice but to go ask around.<br />Of course, you found Jingzhai's refusal to be a little suspicious. Maybe you'll find some new clues if you ask carefully.<br />Doesn't that poet, Guyu, stir concern in anyone?}}

===Head to the Exalting Sanctum and find Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090125-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Cong returned to the Exalting Sanctum, but he hasn't recovered from the failure of the confession. Go and tell Cong what you've learned.<br />You learned that most of the Vidyadhara in Xianzhou are indifferent and not good at forming attachments with others. But at the end of the day, that's just a stereotype.<br />Cong, just give it your all!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Buy a gift for Jingzhai{{subst:void|<!--202090126-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Cong decided to confess once again, this time with a carefully prepared gift and a sincere heart. Anyway, set off now to buy the gift.<br />After listening to your analysis, Cong immediately regained his spirits. Cong is really a simple young man. <br />If so, does Jingzhai really know?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Witness Cong's confession again{{subst:void|<!--202090129-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Cong wants to confess his love again shortly. He knows that he was Jingzhai's lover in his previous life, and this gives him added confidence. Go and witness it again, this should be the last time.<br />Logically speaking, this occasion does not require your presence at all. But, who knows how and where things will pan out?<br />You should see it through to the end.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Head to the Exalting Sanctum and find Cong{{subst:void|<!--202090130-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Cong has withdrawn into himself again. You know what he's been through and feel sorry for him. Go check on him. Hopefully his spirits will lighten up.<br />Besides, you haven't gotten that "Big Reward" you've been thinking about all this time.<br />It's not necessarily a bad thing to experience something like this at least once.}}
