::'''Ruoyue:''' Ah, an esteemed customer visiting Xianzhou from afar. Are you here for a divination today?
::'''Ruoyue:''' Since it's your first time here, allow me to introduce myself. I am the genius diviner, formerly of the Divination Commission, now a humble shopkeeper of the Looking Bronze. My name is Ruoyue.
::'''Ruoyue:''' Whether you're seeking fortune or safety, or simply wish to check your horoscope, to find love, or even to request a name for a child, I am humbly at your service.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wish to name myself.
:::'''Ruoyue:''' Oh, seeking a name for yourself? That is a rare request indeed.
:::'''Ruoyue:''' Looking at you, and with a pinch of my fingers, and I've got the perfect name for you.
:::'''Ruoyue:''' How about "Noob"?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's worse than (Trailblazer).
::::'''Ruoyue:''' That sounds just fine. Your name is fine as it is. I see no need to change it.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That IS my name.
::::'''Ruoyue:''' I wouldn't have known that one with such elegant flair as yours would have such a resounding name.
::::'''Ruoyue:''' You may not be aware, but a name is the shortest form of a spell. If you're ever in peril, just yell out your name "Noob," and it will surely be useful to you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't think your naming lacks a little sophistication?
::::'''Ruoyue:''' Noob Noob, never want for gulp or slurp. Noob Noob, Luofu's friend, always a perk.
::::'''Ruoyue:''' If you don't like that, how about a fee to unlock "Sophisticated Names" and "Seriously Sophisticated Names"... I have services for all needs.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wish to know my fortune.
:::'''Ruoyue:''' You've come to the right person. This is our shop special, the "Fortune for Today." The first try's free. Let me see...
:::'''Ruoyue:''' Oh dear, this scene paints the destruction of the Xianzhou Cangcheng: "Fighting fire with woods will only fuel the flames." Your recent affairs haven't been going your way, so instead of remedying them, you should leave them be.
:::'''Ruoyue:''' We provide fortune-changing services, like the "Evil Begone" bundle for 199, "See No Evil" bundle for 299, and the "Only Good Things From Here On Out" bundle for 599. All great value! What do you think?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It feels like you didn't really think those bundles' names through.
::::'''Ruoyue:''' Those names are of no importance. The prices speak for themselves!
::::'''Ruoyue:''' Names are just superficial packaging. They can change anytime.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you make me pick a dire fortune on purpose?
::::'''Ruoyue:''' Oh, you hurt me with your words. If you don't believe me, let's try another one. Look, it's still the same: "Like birds into nets, when will reunion be, one frets".
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can change my luck just like that?
::::'''Ruoyue:''' Your luck isn't something set in stone. If everything was already pre-determined, where would one's freedom be?
::'''Ruoyue:''' You are our lucky 100th customer for the day, so I'll give you an "Evil Begone" bundle as a favor. This is your "lucky trinket" for today. Don't lose it now.

:::'''Lianyan:''' ...It's just a title. Call it whatever you want.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do the Xianzhou people only like new things?

:::'''Yinshu:''' I don't really read that much, so I can't really recommend anything... Well, the front of the shop is where we keep our bestsellers. There's gotta be a reason why they're bestsellers. Why not start there?
:::'''Yinshu:''' "Views of the Universe from a Starskiff" is a record of wondrous exoplanets by a foxian explorer... Oh, you're from an exoplanet anyways. In that case, hang on and let me think...
:::'''Yinshu:''' How about this one here, "Otherworldly Delights"? It's a collection of short supernatural stories written by the boss here.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Boss, you could be a little more enthusiastic.
:::'''Yinshu:''' ...Bookstores are for selling books. Besides, I'm not the boss here. I just help with running a few chores. I'm not in charge of sales here.
:::'''Yinshu:''' But then again, the boss here doesn't really give a darn about business at all. Here... This is a collection of short supernatural stories he's written, called "Otherworldly Delights."
::'''Yinshu:''' I'm a relative of the owner. He likes listening to other people's conversations, saying that it's good inspiration as an author.
::'''Yinshu:''' You may have seen him over in Starskiff Haven. He does storytelling in some teahouse called Sleepless Earl or other, calling himself something like "Mr. Xiyan."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I may have met him in Starskiff Haven.
:::'''Yinshu:''' He likes getting attention. I'd be truly surprised if you haven't seen him.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are there storytellers aboard Xianzhou?
:::'''Yinshu:''' Have you seen storytellers on other planets? When you put it like that... I can tell you've probably already seen it before.
:::'''Yinshu:''' All I know is, storytelling is a traditional form of performative art. I don't know much else. But perhaps the boss is using his gig as a storyteller to hang out at the teahouse and hear all kinds of supernatural and weird tales.
::'''Yinshu:''' How I wish he could pay a little more attention to his bookstore business... Ah well. Have you got any books there that you'd like to buy?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's about subject and theme.
::'''Graceful Poet:''' Subject and theme alone without profundity, sentimentality, or the ingenuity of metaphor &mdash; without all that, it's just boring.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's about rhythm and style.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's about emotion and meaning.
::'''Graceful Poet:''' That's right &mdash; I can see that you have a deep understanding of poetry, croak!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's about the poet!
::'''Graceful Poet:''' Croak...You're not wrong. The poet's talent dictates the quality of a poem. But I asked you about writing poetry itself!
:'''Graceful Poet:''' Look, the most important thing about writing poetry is capturing those simple human emotions which resonate with everyone. And of all the simple human emotions, the pain of separation and the longing for eventual return is the most universal across all peoples.
:'''Graceful Poet:''' But, alas! Croak! I've been waiting all day here on this jetty but haven't managed to brew up the requisite emotions to compose a poem of departures.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you mean by "poem of departures"?
::'''Graceful Poet:''' "'Tis hard to meet &mdash; and hard to say goodbye"... A poem that describes human emotion when parting from others is called a poem of departures.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Poems aren't spaceships. Can it come just by waiting?
::'''Graceful Poet:''' "From wanderlust to sojourns afar, we all come home a visitor." If it doesn't even arrive at the departure jetty, then you won't be able to find it anywhere, croak.
:'''Graceful Poet:''' I curse the convenience of modern-day transport and communications aboard the Luofu. People depart yet don't have to worry about when they'll return. There's no earnest pleading, no heartfelt emotion, croak...
:'''Graceful Poet:''' The thought of how easy and satisfied goodbyes have become makes me want to stomp my feet in rage &mdash; even though I can't actually reach the ground.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You just don't have the mindset that can see goodbyes.
::'''Graceful Poet:''' When you put it like that... can you, croak?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't you just make do and write whatever?
::'''Graceful Poet:''' No way, croak! Poetry shan't ever just "make do."
::'''Graceful Poet:''' Have you read the doggerel that Master Cong writes? No emotion. You may as well just kill me.
:'''Graceful Poet:''' It's hopeless just waiting here. Please help me find what I'm looking for. There has to be an {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|emotional parting scene}} nearby.
:'''Graceful Poet:''' You know the tropes, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"the voyager saying farewell to his family," "the star-crossed lovers bidding goodbye," "parting friends"}}... that kind of thing. If you see anything, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|please help me snap a photo.}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright, I'll help you snap a pic of a "parting scene."
::'''Graceful Poet:''' Thank you, croak.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to bid you farewell right now to gift you an emotional departure.
::'''Graceful Poet:''' No. I don't have any emotions for you, croak. That's not enough material for a poem, croak!
:'''Graceful Poet:''' Don't worry. I just need to see that human emotion of parting, and the poem would write itself. Then I can give you my Inspo Jade Abacus, and you'll be done with your mission.

::'''Metrical Poet:''' Hey, learn some manners when you've got downtime. Do you think I'm happy speaking in that rhythm all the time? It's so inefficient.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' As an ingenium, I have no choice. If my master wants me to study poetry, I must read of them in spades.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' Poetry relies on the special rhythm of language. Only the permutations that conform to the rhythm can be considered a poem. Master Cong has created me to master the standard of poetry.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' As long as your rhythm and counterpoints meet my standard, I'll hand over my Inspo Jade Abacus. Otherwise, stop disturbing my poetry study.

::'''Metrical Poet:''' No more small talk, and show your true talent. Take it or leave it. Don't disturb my study.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's begin.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' First, I'll test your rhythm. Poets often use words with the same rhyme regularly in a verse to create an artistic echo-like effect.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' Listen carefully. The first line is: "Picking chrysanthemums and drinking wine at sunset."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My sleeves leave a silhouette.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' Not bad.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have a good meal that is hard to forget.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' ...
::'''Metrical Poet:''' I'll let you pass.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I saw a jade pillow and a luxurious kitchen.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' You did not rhyme with my line, and I must punish you for that. However, considering that you haven't got the swing of things, I'll give you another chance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I listen to the wind rolling up the curtains.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' You did not rhyme with my line, and I must punish you for that. However, considering that you haven't got the swing of things, I'll give you another chance.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' "The sky matches with the earth, the rain matches with the wind. The great land matches with the vast sky, the flower matches with the mountain, the red sun matches with the blue sky."
:'''Metrical Poet:''' Counterpoint is about contrasting or combining two terms, phrases, or clauses with opposite meanings. This is not easy.
:'''Metrical Poet:''' Listen carefully. My line is, "Speech is silver."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Silence is golden.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' Hmph, that must be a lucky guess. Still, I approve of it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Life is bitter or sweet.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' This clause does not contrast with my line. I must oust you myself!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Yang is a flirt.
::'''Metrical Poet:''' What Mr. Yang? This clause does not contrast with my line. I must oust you myself!

:'''Cong:''' *sniffle* I failed again... "Mushroom," do you have a better poem?
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Being a poet won't win the heart of Ms. Jingzhai. Please face the music.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't need a poet ingenium from the start.
::'''Gloomy Poet:''' This is difficult to hear, as it denies the meaning of my existence... Yet, you're right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even if you have the best poems in the world, they won't help you.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' None of what we've done so far has anything to do with Ms. Jingzhai.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Master, you've adopted the most expensive but least efficient solution &mdash; writing love poems &mdash; for the issue of "winning the heart of Ms. Jingzhai."
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Love poems cannot replace care and communication.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you made the effort to understand Jingzhai?
::'''Cong:''' I thought she would fall in love with me as long as I could write the best poem in the world.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you just been writing poems so far?
::'''Cong:''' Her ex is a poet, so she must be into people who write poems...
::'''Gloomy Poet:''' You've never made the effort to understand Jingzhai.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' You're just jealous of the poet whom she dated before. Yet, jealousy is a useless emotion.
:'''Cong:''' ...I don't feel like giving up yet. Can you help me again?
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Oh, a mushroom is not in the position to teach you things like this.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' (Trailblazer) and I will help you find out Jingzhai's preferences. You should prepare a gift that she likes and a moving speech. When an opportunity arises, you'll do another love confession.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you know so much about this...
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' When I was wandering outside, I downloaded books about romantic relationships such as ''The Key to a Good Long-Life Species Relationship''... Yet, I don't have the need for love. Oh, this is depressing.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' (Trailblazer), let's get in touch with Jingzhai's colleagues and friends. Perhaps, we can gain some useful info for my master.

:'''Mingyue:''' I'm busy, what do you want to tell me?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask you about Jingzhai.
:'''Mingyue:''' Although I'm a diviner, I don't gossip about others.
:The girl looked around. After making sure the coast was clear, she turned to you with her eyes filled with excitement.
:'''Mingyue:''' Tell me. What do you want to know?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you heard about someone named Guyu?
::'''Mingyue:''' Oh, it's the poet that Jingzhai dated before. I've heard of him!
::'''Mingyue:''' I heard that Jingzhai had a sweet relationship with him. But she seems to be single now. Perhaps, the poet has gone through hatching rebirth or fallen in love with another. No one is sure.
::'''Mingyue:''' No matter how happy a couple is, their relationship is bound to end up badly. Just like divination, woe is the norm.
::'''Mingyue:''' That's why I insist on staying single!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Does Jingzhai have any hobbies?
::'''Mingyue:''' It's undoubtedly writing and reciting poems. Haha, Jingzhai's hobbies are quite old-fashioned. Oh, you want to know about her other hobbies?
::'''Mingyue:''' Among us, she's the most serious about her profession. When she's free, she'll do divination and predict the future. The questions she asks are mostly about her relationship, but the results are not very accurate.
::'''Mingyue:''' Hee-hee, I'm tempted at times to give her a plaque that reads "Genius Diviner" as her birthday gift.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of person is Jingzhai attracted to?
::'''Mingyue:''' I've discussed this with my colleagues before. I think Jingzhai is into people who are unpredictable and romantic. As for why, well, it's been ages since she dated someone. I think it's been a century...
::'''Mingyue:''' She was deeply in love with Guyu, the great poet. I heard that she still keeps the Unity Lock from him as she can't move on from the relationship.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the lock similar to this?

:'''Jingzhai:''' I... see. How can I help you, Cong's friend?

::'''Jingzhai:''' Oh, my... You're just like Cong. He always asks me questions that make me uncomfortable from the get-go.
::'''Jingzhai:''' However, I don't mind answering this once if it means you'll give up. I don't love Guyu anymore, but that doesn't mean I'll accept Cong.

::'''Jingzhai:''' Cong is a great guy. Unlike his previous lifetime, he is very talented in the manufacturing of ingenia.
::'''Jingzhai:''' I just won't fall in love with anybody anymore. This isn't Cong's fault...
::'''Jingzhai:''' Just tell Cong that when you get back.

;(Talk to Huixing)
:'''Huixing:''' It's you, (Trailblazer). Is there something you need?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask you about Jingzhai.
:'''Huixing:''' Jingzhai, our Managing Diviner? As her colleague, I shouldn't comment about her in public.
:'''Huixing:''' Jingzhai has a great personality and excels at what she does. She is an amazing colleague.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you heard about someone named Guyu?
::'''Huixing:''' Oh, I see you're interested in her love life.
::'''Huixing:''' I've heard of him. I think he was a Vidyadhara poet. Jingzhai used to talk about him a lot.
::'''Huixing:''' It is said that they are lovers not only in this life. Guyu and Jingzhai dated each other in their two previous lifetimes too. Everyone considers that a romantic love story.
::'''Huixing:''' However, this isn't possible from the perspective of the Vidyadhara like us.
::'''Huixing:''' Without consuming a special potion, there's no way we can remember our lovers from our past lifetimes. Otherwise, one needs to carry something like a token during their hatching rebirth.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What does Jingzhai like?
::'''Huixing:''' Like? She always complains about how she needs more beautiful clothes. Well, girls will never think they have enough clothes, even if they live to be a thousand years old.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of person is Jingzhai attracted to?
::'''Huixing:''' Shouldn't you ask her directly? Forget it. I understand. I'm sure many are interested in such a lovely lady like her.
::'''Huixing:''' Still, most suitors end up being disappointed. I think you will be no exception.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't say I was interested in Jingzhai.
:::'''Huixing:''' Well, here's my advice for you &mdash; it's better not to date a long-life species, especially the Xianzhou natives, as you will likely get hurt.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
:::'''Huixing:''' If the rumor is right, Jingzhai has gone through too many memorable relationships. To put it bluntly, she can't feel the excitement of being in a relationship anymore now.
::'''Huixing:''' She might have a youthful look, but her soul has aged. Her heart will not flutter for anyone again.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure. How're you feeling?
::'''Cong:''' You must be a kind person to show concern for a mushroom.
:'''Cong:''' ...Forget it. I'm no longer a mushroom, but please let me lie down to heal my broken heart.
:'''Cong:''' "You're a sorrowful sigh at the end of the world,"
:'''Cong:''' "While I'm just a tiny screw."
:'''Cong:''' "I'm at a loss, helpless in ways to mend your broken heart."
:'''Cong:''' ...
:'''Cong:''' Thanks, (Trailblazer). Just leave me alone here. I'll feel better after some time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, you sure can, because you're Cong.
::'''Cong:''' Yes. Cong won't stay depressed for too long.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you keep trying to win her heart?
::'''Cong:''' I won't give up. After all, I'm Cong.
:'''Cong:''' Here is your reward. When I get over it, I'll be my usual self again.

;(Talk to Gloomy Poet)
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Who would've thought that Cong was gloomy, too?
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' Don't worry about him, I'm watching over him. Just let him rest for a little, and he'll be fine after.
:'''Gloomy Poet:''' After this trifle is over, I'm better off continuing as a Gloomy Mushroom...

;(Talk to Yujin)
:'''Yujin:''' Do tell!
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's the difference between haute couture and ready-made?
::'''Yujin:''' Haute couture clothings are premium items that are custom-tailored. The tailor personally handcrafts everything and quantity is limited. Every customer's size must be adhered to, with finer adjustments made to the completed article after.
::'''Yujin:''' Our hauteur lines are all styled in Xianzhou designs. We're not the bandwagon type &mdash; each series is specially themed and packaged.
::'''Yujin:''' Ready-made clothes cost much less than haute couture clothes. Plebeians, if you will, and can't be considered trendy. Tailors will slap on out-of-style patterns on these and hail them as "classics" of the heyday.
::'''Yujin:''' Sometimes, they don't even bother with any designs, and plaster the clothes with their shop logo. And they're a hit with Outworlders for some reason! I hear used clothes have been auctioned off for ridiculous prices... It's an affront to this industry, I say!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you have any outfits to recommend?
::'''Yujin:''' Pick a simple style, and never blindly go for the complicated. Our shop's advice is to stay away from the gaudy when buying haute couture pieces. Get the more obscure ones instead. That is the style befitting Xianzhou's elegance.
::'''Yujin:''' To elaborate, when it comes to picking fabric and color, pick items that are skin-friendly and of neutral tones, such as wool-made ones, in colors like dark, brown, and almond.
::'''Yujin:''' A true mark of a Xianzhou native is to buy the right one, not the most expensive one.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Has Jing Yuan really visited your shop?
::'''Yujin:''' Haha, the general has visited before, but it was a... wayward occasion.
::'''Yujin:''' Madam Qingzu of the Seat of Divine Foresight previously made a tailor's appointment with us, but when General Jing Yuan arrived, he just picked the cheapest ready-made clothes before trying to leave.
::'''Yujin:''' Persuaded by Madam Qingzu, he reluctantly let our tailors measure him. But while we were fussing over him, the general closed his eyes and fell asleep...
::'''Yujin:''' We arranged for the Seat's soldiers to help the general head back, but as soon as those Cloud Knights arrived, the general became energized and quickly left, as if the weariness were never there.
::'''Yujin:''' I remember... I think he ordered dress attire for formal occasions.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Forget about it. I'll come back next time.
::'''Yujin:''' It is Cloudbreadth Sleeves' honor to have entertained an esteemed guest such as yourself! Do let us know in advance the next time you come. We will close up the store just to specially welcome you!

;(Talk to Qingyue)
:'''Qingyue:''' Alright babe, what else would you like to ask?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What actually is a jade abacus then?
::'''Qingyue:''' Darling, to help you understand this as an Outworlder, you can think of a jade abacus as a kind of jade computer unique to Xianzhou.
::'''Qingyue:''' Every jade abacus contains a precise and meticulous engraved circuit and uses that to process complex calculations &mdash; just like the superconductor circuit boards common in your world.
::'''Qingyue:''' After the Jade Decipher Workshop from the Artisanship Commission developed their Standards for Manufacture of Civilian-Purpose Jade Abaci, various brands have sprung onto the market &mdash; but I still recommend the Auspicious as the best of the lot.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You also uploading videos online?
::'''Qingyue:''' Haha, all the hottest shopkeepers are making videos these days. Only old antique dealers leave things up to luck, desperate for passers-by to notice them...
::'''Qingyue:''' Besides, these are adverts for my store. People like my videos, trust my products, and then come into the store to buy a jade abacus... that's how the video economy works.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I never expected jade jewelry to be so popular...
::'''Qingyue:''' Babe, please forgive me for speaking so frankly. It's not that jade jewelry is so popular here. It's just that Outworlders have an antiquated understanding of jadeware.
::'''Qingyue:''' Here aboard Xianzhou, these jade items are not just beautiful stones.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I sense that you're a real fiend for tech...
::'''Qingyue:''' Ah, there aren't many people these days who can keep up with my sense of fashion. People around me are all out-of-touch. I often think that out of the masses of people who passes Starskiff Haven, only I understand how powerful the new Auspicious' algorithm is...
::'''Qingyue:''' You know, everyone aboard Xianzhou looks really young at first glance, but as soon as they open their mouths to speak, you instantly realize just how moldy they are from the inside out. Tsk, I can't stand it.
::'''Qingyue:''' On Xianzhou, aging has nothing to do with your age. If your mind is old, then you truly are old.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I'll consider it.
::'''Qingyue:''' Have a good think about it, sweetie. You're welcome back, any time.

;(Talk to Mengming)
:'''Mengming:''' Ah, you spotted that we're rather quiet right now. Alright, if there are any aspects of etiquette that you don't understand, ask me, and I'll pick your brains about doing business.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What are the rules in tea appreciation?
::'''Mengming:''' It would take forever to explain all the rules. I'll just talk about tea selection and water retention for now.
::'''Mengming:''' Speaking of tea selection, take our Hunter Maofeng tea as an example. The Sleepless Earl only picks the most precious buds, usually long, pointed, and covered in fine hairs.
::'''Mengming:''' As for water retention, tea merchants always say that mineral water is the best &mdash; but the clear and ancient water in Scalegorge Waterscape is the best. There's no better water for tea and alchemy than this.
::'''Mengming:''' I'm also only learning and invite you to call me out if anything I've said is wrong.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What made you want to open up a teahouse here?
::'''Mengming:''' My parents opened this teahouse, not me. The Sleepless Earl has been on Starwatcher Avenue for over four hundred years!
::'''Mengming:''' Dad wanted to be near to the port, with all the tired and thirsty people nearby. It was always sure to be a booming business, and we owe all our successes to the kindness of our customers.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You are the model of a good young business owner.
::'''Mengming:''' I'm... not young! I'm just at the right age to take over the family business. People may always say we foxians are naturals when it comes to business, but really it's all practice.
::'''Mengming:''' Dad said that he wanted to test me, so he left me the teahouse and wandered off traveling with mom. I'm still a long way off from being proficient in doing business.
::'''Mengming:''' Even now, I still have to ask Mr. Xiyan lots of questions. If you're willing to support me, please be generous with your criticism.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
::'''Mengming:''' It's okay. Come back when you've got more time to spare.

;(Talk to Gao Tang)
:'''Gao Tang:''' Oh, ask away. I have much to share, as long as it's about food.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Is it true? That there's no good food in the Starskiff Haven?
::'''Gao Tang:''' Strictly speaking, Starskiff Haven's food is enough to sate your hunger. Whether it tastes good is another matter.
::'''Gao Tang:''' Without stringent selection nor prudent handling of ingredients, I refuse to accept food that has been made haphazardly.
::'''Gao Tang:''' But don't worry. Starskiff Haven's food does not represent Xianzhou's culinary landscape. You can still find restaurants dedicated to the craft here.
::'''Gao Tang:''' If nothing else, once you've tried the dishes at the Garden of Gourmet, I'm sure you will lose interest in this subpar fare.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of food does the Garden of Gourmet serve?
::'''Gao Tang:''' The restaurant's been making sturgeons recently. This type of fish returns once every fifty years, and is a key ingredient in "Five Lords of Anhe River."
::'''Gao Tang:''' In the Garden of Gourmet, we extract the three crunchiest bones from the tail, boil them in a broth of myriad herbs, then grill them using fresh goat's fat paste. At the final stage, we slow fry them till the meaty bones are caramelized and crisp.
::'''Gao Tang:''' Any step that's not up to snuff in this process, and I'll dump the dish entirely. This is also why the Garden of Gourmet has no menu &mdash; we only serve one table a day.
::'''Gao Tang:''' No such thing as food too fine, or meat too minced. Those of Xianzhou have lived for a thousand years, we must be meticulous with what goes in our mouths.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You speak with such passion when discussing cuisine.
::'''Gao Tang:''' We are all, in some way, shaped by our food. You wouldn't want to be made shoddily, would you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wouldn't.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' I thought so.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' I notice you are an Outworlder. Your food tapestry must be limited, so you must make wiser choices.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' To be strict with what you eat is to be strict with the "reason why we are people."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm fine either way.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' Either way?
:::'''Gao Tang:''' I notice you are an Outworlder. Your food tapestry must be limited, so you must make wiser choices.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' To be strict with what you eat is to be strict with the "reason why we are people."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not exactly a role model to begin with.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' I worry for you.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' I notice you are an Outworlder. Your food tapestry must be limited, so you must make wiser choices.
:::'''Gao Tang:''' To be strict with what you eat is to be strict with the "reason why we are people."
