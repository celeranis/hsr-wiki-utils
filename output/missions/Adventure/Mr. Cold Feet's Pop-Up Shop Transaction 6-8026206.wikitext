{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sampo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620103--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620201-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620203--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620301-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Business people like us are all about buying things from one place and selling them to other places. You might think that this meme isn't working out in Belobog, but someone might actually love it on some other planet.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620303--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620401-->)
::'''Sampo:''' I jest, but the Knights of Beauty are most deserving of my utmost admiration. There are only two types of people as steadfast as them: Idiots and fools.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620403--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620501-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Honestly though, these stress relief toys are really getting popular these days. Then again, the world's full of turmoil that makes it hard to laugh.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' Heh, I've been waiting for you. I'm getting ready to hustle some premium goods this time. I just need some {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Meteoric Alloy}} and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Metal}}. Shall we begin?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's talk about this deal.
::'''Sampo:''' This Echoer reminds me of that tavern's legend again. It's said that the World's End Tavern opens its doors to all, except for a certain type...
::'''Sampo:''' The type who does the same thing over and over every day, never-changing in their routine... Humdrum, mundane, even more of a robot than an Intellitron.
::'''Sampo:''' ...That may be so, but this fable is just that, after all. Who wouldn't have an ounce of hectic excitement in their lives? I'd like to meet such a person, haha.
