:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Citizens, we have seen it too, it was this outlander!
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' That my beloved Bossman would exhibit such major mood swings, refusing to receive guests for days on end, it is the trickery of this outlander.
:'''Flustered Outlander:''' Slander! I&mdash;I only petted it lightly... Who knew your dromas would be so timid?
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Hmph, "lightly"? My dromases are sacred beasts blessed by {{Rubi|Georios|Earth Titan}}. They are nigh priceless!
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Like Bossman here, it loses its appetite when it's frightened. Without food, it won't have strength to carry people, and if it doesn't work, I'll lose that much more money in a day!
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' And look at these beautiful scales, they are a little shabby, but... Wuh, when did this scratch appear? You must have done this with your grubby fingers!
:'''Flustered Outlander:''' Eh? That... That was already there to begin with.
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Stop making excuses, no one else touched it besides you that day. You will pay for my losses!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
::'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Oh, look who's here? Even the hero who fought alongside the Chrysos Heirs stands with me &mdash; justice does lie in the hearts of people.
::Outlander?
::'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' That's right, for these scoundrels from outside the holy city who covet our wealth, their punishment must be swift and just.

:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Those who have just arrived, worry not, for I shall reiterate the story once more...
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' In recent times, Bossman had been unusually lazy. I noticed something amiss, and personally stood guard by its cage. Guess who I caught red-handed &mdash; this outlander!
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' He would come here on time every day, get close to Bossman and pinch it violently. My heart bleeds for its abuse!
:'''Flustered Outlander:''' I&mdash;I was massaging it! I noticed something off with its behavior, surmising that it was overworked, and wanted to ease its pain...
:'''Flustered Outlander:''' An owner like you &mdash; working your beasts of burden to the bone without a day off &mdash; even mountain dwellers would be hard-pressed to keep up.
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' H&mdash;How we rear our livestock in Okhema will not be dictated by an ignorant outlander such as you! Are you disrespecting our customs?
:'''Nosy Bystander:''' That's right, I don't know much about dromases, but this outlander is overstepping his boundaries...
:'''Sarcastic Bystander:''' Yeah, that one might even be another remnant of {{Rubi|Zagreus|Trickery Titan}}'s worshipers. Look at them sneaking about...
:'''Liluder the Wealthy:''' Hear that? According to our laws, you now have two choices: Resolve this with compensation, or I'll see you in civilian court.
:'''Flustered Outlander:''' Hah? But I have no money...

::'''Soctires:''' It's you, young friend. Come on down, the water is just right.
::I've got a complete grasp of the situation!
::'''Soctires:''' Is that so? Your actions are worth commending then.
::'''Soctires:''' There was once a sage who said this: "Public opinion cannot be heard with only one ear." How about listening to what I have gathered?
::Can I not go down?
::'''Soctires:''' I'm used to thinking with the flow of water. Sometimes we are but a miniscule spark of inspiration away from the truth. You ought to give it a try too.
::Only a hot bath will satisfy me.
::'''Soctires:''' ...A bath is all about knowing your limits. Thrills aren't my strong suit at my age, please bear with me for a moment.
::Then I'll gladly accept it.
::You enter the bath &mdash; as he said, the temperature is just right.
::'''Soctires:''' Where should I begin... How about we start with you? I hear that Nikador's brethren were running rampant in the city when you first arrived in Okhema.
::'''Soctires:''' Before that attack happened, an occasional outlander seeking refuge would come here for shelter. Their cities had been razed to the ground, and they could not survive long in the wasteland.
::'''Soctires:''' And now, the number of refugees seeking protection in the holy city is rising. Because you defeated Nikador, and made the journey to Okhema that much safer...
::The Trailblazers garner much merit.
::'''Soctires:''' Haha! If an outlander bard hears of your exploits, I reckon he will surely write a song regaling your feat.
::You mean I caused this problem?
::'''Soctires:''' Don't think of it like that. Future events cannot be predicted. And to these outlanders, that is most welcome news.
::How cruel...
::'''Soctires:''' Exactly. Survival is a luxury. The homeless refugees who face the black tide... they have zero chance at victory.
::Is it because they didn't pay the toll?
::'''Soctires:''' Not everyone covets wealth, especially monsters that have long forsaken their sanity... But your joke has injected some levity in such dire times.
::(Remain silent)
::'''Soctires:''' Resources during disasters are scarce, and Okhema can't take in too many outlanders. Welcoming everyone will only plunge the city into chaos.
::'''Soctires:''' Right now, most of these outlanders have been situated in a shelter far away from the city walls. The conditions are much better than the wasteland's, with the city guards protecting the place. But it will never grant them a sense of security akin to their homes.
::'''Soctires:''' So the Council of Elders came up with a temporary solution: To allow only a small number of outlanders into the city, decided by drawing lots. This method may be unfair to those who object, because the Council has rigged the process to select the useful ones...
::'''Soctires:''' Strong men who have mastery over special skills and proficiency in heavy labor stand the highest chances, while old folk with children in tow the lowest, even if they require more assistance.
::Sounds hardly fair.
::'''Soctires:''' Alas, there is no evidence to prove that this sorting really exists. Even the citizens think that this is the authority of the host city &mdash; we have the right to decide who we help.
::Isn't this normal then?
::'''Soctires:''' Some citizens do think that these conditions are but the authority of the host city &mdash; we have the right to decide who we help.
::How about no one gets allowed in then, that's most fair.
::'''Soctires:''' Some radicals do think this way, saying that Okhema should not accept any outlanders at all. But if that were the case we would be solitary in our stand against the black tide &mdash; Mydei and Phainon are foreign as well.
::So the Council of Elders recognizes strength as well.
::'''Soctires:''' You mean... I see, those of ability are more easily favored.
::'''Soctires:''' Okhema's resources are limited, but there is enough to aid most of the outlanders. The real question is: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Are we willing to pay the price?}}
::'''Soctires:''' If a group of strangers was starving at the gates, and they could live with a mouthful of food, Okhema would be more than capable of saving them, but you and I would have one fewer bite...

:'''Soctires:''' I know. I will think of a way... at least to guarantee their survival.
:'''Soctires:''' The good news is, food isn't strictly regulated. You can easily get enough food to feed these people for a week at the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Marmoreal Market}}.
:'''Soctires:''' So, I suggest we split up: Palaten and I will secure the medicine, while our young friend buys some food back, after which we will reconvene here.
:'''Palaten the Scholar:''' Hey, do I really need to come along? I was thinking of doing the procurement with this gray-haired hero.
:'''Soctires:''' I need a helper. Remember my instructions last month? I'm getting old, and there are many things that I need help for.
:'''Soctires:''' If there comes a day when I haven't the strength to walk a step farther, you'll have to take my mantle and carry on guiding the people of Okhema.

:'''Soctires:''' Well then, before we set out, is there anything our young friend wants to say?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me.

::Don't forget to reimburse me then.
::'''Soctires:''' Haha, of course! When everything's over, just give the invoice to Palaten &mdash; he's the best at doing the accounts.
::'''Palaten the Scholar:''' Teacher, being good at the ledger isn't the same as paying for stuff... Please don't tease me!
::Can't we notify the officials?
::'''Soctires:''' Lives are at stake. We've got no time to do it by the book... We'll report this to the Council of Elders when the problem is resolved.
::'''Palaten the Scholar:''' It sounds like these people's fates are relying on our success. I never thought a lowly apprentice like me would get a chance to perform such heroics... Sounds awfully exciting!

:'''Soctires:''' You're asking the wrong question. We should always provide all the help we can to the weak, not just because it is moral. It is the correct action, even from a utilitarian perspective.
:'''Soctires:''' Who knows when the roles of the strong and weak will be reversed? When we will also need their help? Besides, isn't Kephale's majesty in bearing the burdens of the world for the people?
:'''Palaten the Scholar:''' I never thought a lowly apprentice like me would get the chance to carry on Kephale's will. It sounds very exciting!

;(Talk to Soctires)
:This room's layout is quite cozy. There are no bars nor restraining devices &mdash; a modicum of respect has been left for whoever gets detained here.
:'''Soctires:''' You're here, young friend...
:Soctires' eyes are somewhat avoidant, as if he is reluctant to have you see him in this state.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you do?
::'''Soctires:''' I believe you have already guessed the gist of it, even if I don't say anything &mdash; to help the outlanders secure medicine, I slipped into the holy city's supply warehouse.
::Palaten said you were caught by the guards.
::'''Soctires:''' He wasn't lying. As for the reason I was caught, even if I said nothing, I'm sure you can guess the gist of it...
::'''Soctires:''' To help the outlanders secure medicine, I slipped into the holy city's supply warehouse.
::I didn't want to come initially.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Palaten said you were caught by the guards.
::'''Soctires:''' He wasn't lying. As for the reason I was caught, even if I said nothing, I'm sure you can guess the gist of it...
::'''Soctires:''' To help the outlanders secure medicine, I slipped into the holy city's supply warehouse.
::I didn't want to come initially.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't want to come initially.
:'''Soctires:''' Yes, who would want to be involved with a suspect... To help the outlanders secure medicine, I slipped into the holy city's supply warehouse.
:'''Soctires:''' It is theft. I understand very well that I was committing a crime. As for how it ended, it was simply my just deserts.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} There must have been a better way.
::'''Soctires:''' Of course. As an onlooker, we can always find myriad reasons to convince ourselves, that a better idea would surface if we just waited a while longer.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Was there a need to go this far?
::'''Soctires:''' You're not the only one with this question: As a citizen, why did I risk everything to help a bunch of strangers?
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What're you going to do now?
::'''Soctires:''' According to the holy city's laws, they will make me stand trial. There's a high chance they won't be lenient.
::'''Soctires:''' The price must be paid for doing the right thing, even more so for an ambiguously moral act like mine conducted to sate my own savior complex. I am fully ready to accept its consequences.
::'''Soctires:''' Before the final moment arrives, my only wish is to eat another apple.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Apple?
::'''Soctires:''' Yes, apples are my favorite food. "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."

::'''Soctires:''' It is theft. I understand very well that I was committing a crime. As for how it ended, it was simply my just deserts.
::'''Soctires:''' As to whether it was worth it, my only regret is that I didn't manage to transport more medicine out of the city into the hands of those who need it...
::'''Soctires:''' I'm sorry for disappointing you. I may have to renege on that promise to treat you to a meal.
::There must have been a better way.
::'''Soctires:''' Of course. As an onlooker, we can always find myriad reasons to convince ourselves, that a better idea would surface if we just waited a while longer.
::'''Soctires:''' But those who need help can't wait, and neither could I. I am an old man &mdash; I don't have the luxury of time nor patience.
::Was there a need to go this far?
::'''Soctires:''' You're not the only one with this question: As a citizen, why did I risk everything to help a bunch of strangers?
::'''Soctires:''' Because I, too, hope that in my time of need, someone will lend me a hand.
::'''Soctires:''' A sage once said: "If you want someone to be kind to you, you must first be kind to others." I think this is most appropriate here.
::'''Soctires:''' Of course, there are always people who think they'll never find themselves in hardship. Except... who can ensure that Okhema's city walls will stand tall forever?
::What're you going to do now?
::'''Soctires:''' According to the holy city's laws, they will make me stand trial. There's a high chance they won't be lenient.

::'''Soctires:''' Yes, apples are my favorite food. "An apple a day keeps the doctor away."
::'''Soctires:''' 'Tis a pity we didn't get to know each other better, otherwise I would surely discuss the wonderful flavor of apples with you, along with many other matters...
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (That reminds me, that girl in the Abyss gave me an apple... Should I give it to him?)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Give him the apple.
:::'''Soctires:''' Oh, you actually have an apple on you? This is one of the ten essential idiosyncrasies among sages. You learn fast!
:::'''Soctires:''' Thank you... I will have no regrets now.
:::Soctires gleefully crunches down on the apple. When he's halfway through eating, the cell's guard walks in.
:::Nope.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nope.
::You don't give him the apple. Soctires smiles palely and lowers his head &mdash; there is nothing left to be said.
::The cell's guard enters, cutting through that thick silence.
::'''Holy City Guard:''' Visiting time is over. Outlander hero, it is time to leave.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you release him?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you punish him?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What fate is in store for him?
::'''Holy City Guard:''' It is not up to me to decide. The public court will handle him.
