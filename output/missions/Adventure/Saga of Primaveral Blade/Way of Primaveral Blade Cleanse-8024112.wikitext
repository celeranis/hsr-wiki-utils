{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Huohuo during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Huohuo for some advice.}}

;(Talk to Huohuo)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi huohuo 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi huohuo 101 f.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' March, (Trailblazer), we heard that Skott sent you a challenge, so we were wondering if there's anything we can do to help you defeat him.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 228.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Thanks, Huohuo! You've already been a huge help by teaching me how to use the exorcising tools! Even though I've only been learning swordplay for a short time, I'm confident I can take down the IPC mechs.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi huohuo 102.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Don't mention it. It's actually me who should be thanking you, March.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi tail 101 f.ogg}} '''Tail:''' But seriously, didn't (Trailblazer) kick Skott's butt already? So why's he back again? Don't humans ever learn from their mistakes?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 229.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No, no, Mr. Tail. There's a saying, "Revenge is a dish best served cold," but Skott hardly has any patience. He couldn't resist the temptation to get back at us.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 230.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Still, if that's how I beat him... it'd be a little less... satisfying.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Giving Skott a good beating isn't satisfying enough for you?
:::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 231.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmm... I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wouldn't be satisfying enough.
:::So, what would be your ideal way of teaching him a lesson?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, what would be your ideal way of teaching him a lesson?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 232.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Actually, I have no idea...
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 102.ogg}} '''Tail:''' I get it. Some people never learn, no matter how many times you knock them down. They'll never admit defeat or learn anything.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi huohuo 103.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' So... how do we get him to admit defeat?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any ideas, Mr. Tail?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 103.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Listen kid, I'm not trying to rag on you, but you're always playing into Skott's hands with your approach.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 104.ogg}} '''Tail:''' He set up these rules for a fight between his mechs and your sword, and you agreed. Then he laid out what to do if you win or lose, and you agreed again... It's basically just another one of Skott's organized sports events, and it's not even fun if you win!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rules are made to be broken!
:::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi tail 105 f.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Hey, cut it out kid, just leave the cool catchphrases to me!
:::What do you think, Mr. Tail?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you think, Mr. Tail?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 106.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Hmm, looks like you've come to the right person.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 107.ogg}} '''Tail:''' I'm a heliobus, and I've got a few tricks up my sleeve! Just remove my seal, Huohuo...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it really okay to remove your seal?
:::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 108.ogg}} '''Tail:''' What's the harm? As long as you don't go snitching to that Ghosty, we won't run into any trouble.
:::Are you planning to possess Skott?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you planning to possess Skott?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 109.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Heh, just possessing him won't be enough. I'm going to get inside his head.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 110.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Just wait and see. I'll make Skott change his mind and admit defeat wholeheartedly. What do you say?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 233.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whoa! You're awesome, Mr. Tail!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll leave it to you then, Mr. Tail!
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Just a moment. I have something else to do.

:{{A|VO side2 baishi huohuo 106.ogg}} '''Huohuo:''' Skott seems weird... Did you really make him change his ways, Mr. Tail?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 142.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Well, this is my first time doing something like this, so I'm not sure how things will turn out.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 240.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You've managed to make a guy like him turn over a new leaf. You're amazing, Mr. Tail!

:{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 144.ogg}} '''Tail:''' I removed his twisted desires, and now he's genuinely trying to become a "lone wolf."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're incredible.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 145.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Of course I am. I've stolen his twisted heart!
::Good thing you're on our side.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi tail 146.ogg}} '''Tail:''' Yeah, you'd ought to remember it's best not to make an enemy out of Huohuo.
