;(Talk to Skott)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 136.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Well, well, if it isn't our hero, March 7th!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 212.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmph, I'm not hiding or backing down. You challenged me, and I'm here to accept it.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 213.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...But I'm curious, why pick Aurum Alley of all places? It's packed with tourists around, and it'd be bad if someone got hurt.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 137 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi scott 137 f.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Why Aurum Alley? Well, your buddy knows the answer to that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, this is the place you lost a bet and barked like a dog, after all.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 138.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I can't deny it. That fateful day left a mark on me.
::Because you took a hit to your career that day.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Because you took a hit to your career that day.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 139.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Exactly. On that fateful day, I was reassigned, dismissed from my department's core operations.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 140.ogg}} '''Skott:''' That's why I chose this place. I want to show all those people who laughed at me that I can stand on my own two feet again.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 141.ogg}} '''Skott:''' They'll be like, "What...!? That Skott is back again? What's he got up to this time?"
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 142.ogg}} '''Skott:''' They'll see that I, Skott, who was once shamed in front of everyone, is back in Aurum Alley to restore his honor!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 143.ogg}} '''Skott:''' They'll see that it won't be me squealing like a pig today, but YOU!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems kinda petty, don't you think?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 214.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, if that's all a villain did in an immersia, I'd definitely be asking for a refund.
::Are you even seeking revenge on the right person?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you even seeking revenge on the right person?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 144.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Right person? No, I want to enact revenge on the entirety of Aurum Alley!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 215.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...But then wait, where does bullying the owner of the Sleepless Earl fit in with all of this?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 145.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Ugh! Shut up!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 146.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Look, I have my principles. I refuse to spend my life haunted by what happened in Aurum Alley! Do you think I'm just some sort of IPC small fry?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 147.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I've been patient for so long, just waiting for the right moment! I don't care about proving my greatness &mdash; it's about showing everyone in Aurum Alley that I will reclaim what was taken from me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Spare me the lecture! You're not getting back what you lost!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 216.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No, you won't!
::You should reclaim your dignity in a more respectable way!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should reclaim your dignity in a more respectable way!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 217.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Instead of resorting to such despicable methods!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 148.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I've been keeping an eye on you. Seriously, do you really believe that you, a rookie who's only been learning swordplay for fifteen days, can defeat my invincible mechs? Dream on!
