===Talk to Jiaoqiu and the rest===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Jiaoqiu during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Jiaoqiu for some advice.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|According to Jiaoqiu's "despicable" plan, all you need to do is show up to the duel with Skott. With the laxatives, you're sure to serve him a gushing defeat.<br />Oh boy, Jiaoqiu sure is despicable. Well, the die is cast. Time to go to Aurum Alley.}}
