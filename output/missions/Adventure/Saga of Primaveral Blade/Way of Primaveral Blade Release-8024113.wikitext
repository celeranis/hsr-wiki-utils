|summary       = March 7th's swordplay improves significantly thanks to Jiaoqiu's help... Jiaoqiu's offering of potent Yaoqing medicines reduced Skott's capacities significantly in the final duel.<br />That was indeed an underhanded tactic. Hopefully, that didn't leave Skott with too much trauma.

===Talk to Jiaoqiu and the rest{{subst:void|<!--802411301-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Jiaoqiu during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Jiaoqiu for some advice.}}
