===Talk to Jiaoqiu and the rest{{subst:void|<!--802411301-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Jiaoqiu during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Jiaoqiu for some advice.}}

;(Talk to Bailu)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 245.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I'm about to duel with Skott, but I always feel like my fighting skills haven't improved enough! Can I really defeat Skott? I'm starting to worry!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 246.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I mean, don't you have some miracle pills that can instantly unlock my meridians, boost my cultivation, and make me a super strong hero? You know, the kind where you just pop one and instantly become an invincible swordmaster!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a disciple of Sanctus Medicus or something?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 247.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! Don't say something like that in front of these healers! I don't want to end up in some Realm-Keeping Commission court!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 101.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Well, even though it's a risky idea, I'm glad you're finally willing to do whatever it takes to win, Miss March.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 248.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, that's actually a compliment I don't want to hear!
::Come on, do you really think there's a magical pill like that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come on, do you really think there's a magical pill like that?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 249.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I mean why not? Haven't you heard the stories in Mr. Xiyan's ''Legend of the Trailblazer''? The hero took the Elixir of Dragon Oil and gave Phantylia a good beating! Why can't I just do the same to Skott?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 101.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Do you even realize how much those legends get exaggerated?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 101.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' We don't have any convenient pills like that, but if you just need a temporary boost for the duel, we might be able to figure something out.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 102.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' I've made a bowl of Matsutake Longan White Bamboo Sparrow Soup for you, Miss March. It's nourishing and will give you a good energy boost.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want some too! I want some too!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 103.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Hey now! This tonic is very potent, if you don't engage in any intense physical activity, it might do more harm than good.
::Is it really a good idea to drink a lot of liquid before a fight?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it really a good idea to drink a lot of liquid before a fight?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 104.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Ah don't worry, your body will remind you to finish the fight quickly.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 250.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Can I drink half now and save the other half for later? Just in case Skott beats me, I can use it to recover...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 105.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Are you really that lacking in confidence, March? Hmm... I was actually looking forward to tripling the fee when the IPC guys came in for treatment.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 251.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You don't know the half of it! Those IPC mechs pack a huge punch!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 102.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' If it's just pain you're afraid of, I might have a solution...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 103.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Here, this medicine is named "Yabruh." A tiny dose can numb the body's senses and alleviate any sensation of pain.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 104.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Actually, some of the Cloud Knights use pellets which contain trace amounts of this ingredient. When you block pain on the battlefield, you have a better chance of beating your opponent and surviving.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 252.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whoa! Sounds incredible! But... are there any side effects?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 105.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' No, not at all. We use it for surgeries in the Alchemy Commission, so what kind of side effects could it possibly have? It's just...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 253.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Just what?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 106.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Well, the thing is, pain is your body's way of warning you something is wrong. If you ignore it and push through... you might end up with some serious injuries without even realizing it.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 107.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' I had a patient who took some before a fight, only to realize that afterwards... his lower body was missing...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 254.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whew! Okay, enough! I'm not taking any medicine. I'll just tough it out!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 106.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' We're all brainstorming ideas, why are you so quiet, Doctor Jiaoqiu?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi bailu 107.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Doctor Jiaoqiu? Jiaoqiu! March is about to face off with Skott! What are you doing?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 102.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Oh, sorry! I heard March was planning to use some medicine against Skott, so I made some preparations.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 103.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Well, it seems you're struggling to think outside the box. Sometimes, weakening your opponent is just as effective as improving your own combat skills. It's all about innovation.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 255.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait, could it be that the Yaoqing people have some secret formula that could help me?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 104.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' Exactly! This is the closely guarded secret of the Yaoqing's Ranzhi School. If it weren't for Miss March's upcoming battle, I would never divulge it.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 256.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait... do you plan on slipping Skott a laxative?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 105.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' ...How did you figure that out? Hmph, looks like I'm too predictable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Praise be to the Xianzhou medicine.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi lingsha 108.ogg}} '''Lingsha:''' Seriously, don't even compare this guy to us.
::How despicable, Doc "Despicable."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How despicable, Doc "Despicable."
:{{A|VO side2 baishi jiaoqiu 106.ogg}} '''Jiaoqiu:''' What you call "despicable," I call "efficient."
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 257.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well... Doctor Jiaoqiu? Are we really doing this? Shouldn't we defeat him in a more honorable way...? Maybe we should just completely forget about this idea.

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 195.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Ah, March 7th, you've finally decided to show up! Bet you don't know how incredibly unpopular you are here in Aurum Alley!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 261.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Unpopular? What are you talking about? Who in Aurum Alley wouldn't like a cheerful and adorable young lady like me?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 196.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, I've caught wind of the gossip. They're just scared of Yanqing and Yunli's power, so they don't have the guts to speak up!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 197.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Guess what? A brave soul approached me in secret earlier, encouraging me to defeat you and seek revenge for all the people in Aurum Alley!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 198.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And you know what else? He gave me and the guys a big pot of this special medicinal soup to drink so we can come at you with triple the energy.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 262.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Haha, well... they do sound like... a brave soul...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, did you guys take it all?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 199.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Of course we did! That soup was surprisingly delicious. Who'd have thought, in a cold and indifferent place like the Luofu, we'd find something so heartwarming?
::There was a laxative in that soup.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There was a laxative in that soup.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 200.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You think I'm an idiot? Your statement aims to dismantle and fragment the coalition established on the basis of shared interests and class affinities between ourselves and the erudite individuals dwelling in Aurum Alley, with the ultimate goal of defeating me.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 263.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Um... I didn't understand a word of what you just said.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 201.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Alright, enough talking! Let's go, boys! That delicious medicinal soup will give us the strength to win!

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 210.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I lost. I am defeated... You fight too dirty, March 7th. You are truly despicable.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 265.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You'd better go to the bathroom...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 211.ogg}} '''Skott:''' No... I don't need to go to the bathroom anymore.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 266.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 212.ogg}} '''Skott:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the "pig squealing" part?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 267.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Let's just forget about that part. He's already in such a sorry state.
::I guess we did fight a bit too dirty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I guess we did fight a bit too dirty.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 268.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...But deep down, it feels kinda good. Is this what slipping into the dark side feels like?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 213.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I have one last thing to say... March 7th.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 269.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Fine, give me a piece of your mind if you want! I admit it. I was kinda out of line...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 214.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You've earned my respect.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 270.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait, what???
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 215.ogg}} '''Skott:''' March 7th, you're the first person I've ever known who's just as despicable, cruel, and as heartless as me. But this time, you outdid yourself, being even more vile, more ruthless, and more unscrupulous than ever! I accept my defeat!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 216.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Maybe we'll actually become real friends someday. If you want to come and work for the IPC, I'll gladly write you a recommendation letter.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go for it.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 217.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Go for it. I don't have the strength to fight back anyway.
::A single drop of icy tear, finally succumbing to uncontainable sorrow, escapes from the corner of the man's eye.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 272.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Forget it, I don't kick people when they're down, even if they annoy me.
