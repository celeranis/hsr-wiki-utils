===Talk to Silver Wolf{{subst:void|<!--802411401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Silver Wolf during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Silver Wolf for some advice.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Silver Wolf pays no heed to March 7th's swordplay duel, but she implants a little something into March 7th's sword to repay her for her help in the last few days: A code that'll breach the inner defenses of an IPC Mech.<br />You have Silver Wolf's assurance that everything's going to be fine, so head over to Aurum Alley.}}
