{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Silver Wolf during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Silver Wolf for some advice.}}

;(Talk to Silver Wolf)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 278.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'm going up against Skott soon. I'm so nervous.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 101.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Nervous about what? Dealing with a few IPC minions is just a walk in the park.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 279.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But Skott will definitely use the IPC's mechs. There's no way I can take them down with just a couple of swords, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It wouldn't be a problem for Yanqing or Yunli.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 280.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Masters could handle them for sure! But isn't it asking too much of a poor little rookie like me?
::The mechs' armor is too thick.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The mechs' armor is too thick.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 281.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right? Even if Master Yanqing says there's a mechanism in this sword that helps with cutting... can it really slice through a mech?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 102.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Why focus on piercing the armor? For hackers, the ideal way to win is to infiltrate the opponent's system.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 103.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Here, give me your sword.
:No one has any idea what Silver Wolf did to March 7th's sword.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 104.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Alright, you've been enhanced. Go for it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you do?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 105.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' You'll understand once the duel begins.
::Don't you need to enhance the other sword too?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't you need to enhance the other sword too?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 106.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' No, when it comes to programming, less is more. Overdoing it increases the chance of creating errors.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 282.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... I can defeat him just like that?

===Go to Aurum Alley and engage in the promised duel{{subst:void|<!--802411403-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Silver Wolf pays no heed to March 7th's swordplay duel, but she implants a little something into March 7th's sword to repay her for her help in the last few days: A code that'll breach the inner defenses of an IPC Mech.<br />You have Silver Wolf's assurance that everything's going to be fine, so head over to Aurum Alley.}}

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 195.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Ah, March 7th, you've finally decided to show up! Bet you don't know how incredibly unpopular you are here in Aurum Alley!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 261.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Unpopular? What are you talking about? Who in Aurum Alley wouldn't like a cheerful and adorable young lady like me?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 196.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, I've caught wind of the gossip. They're just scared of Yanqing and Yunli's power, so they don't have the guts to speak up!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 197.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Guess what? A brave soul approached me in secret earlier, encouraging me to defeat you and seek revenge for all the people in Aurum Alley!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 198.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And you know what else? He gave me and the guys a big pot of this special medicinal soup to drink so we can come at you with triple the energy.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 262.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Haha, well... they do sound like... a brave soul...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, did you guys take it all?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 199.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Of course we did! That soup was surprisingly delicious. Who'd have thought, in a cold and indifferent place like the Luofu, we'd find something so heartwarming?
::There was a laxative in that soup.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There was a laxative in that soup.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 200.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You think I'm an idiot? Your statement aims to dismantle and fragment the coalition established on the basis of shared interests and class affinities between ourselves and the erudite individuals dwelling in Aurum Alley, with the ultimate goal of defeating me.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 263.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Um... I didn't understand a word of what you just said.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 201.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Alright, enough talking! Let's go, boys! That delicious medicinal soup will give us the strength to win!

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 220.ogg}} '''Skott:''' March 7th, you're late. Here I was thinking you were too chicken to show your face. I was thinking I might have to track you down and settle the score~
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 284.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Too chicken? I was giving you the chance to back out! But you're actually insulting me now, you cheeky...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We ride a train everywhere, delays are to be expected every once in a while.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 221.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Making excuses for being late like it's no big deal? If you worked under me, I'd personally make you regret it.
::What's the rush? You only got one day left to live or something?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's the rush? You only got one day left to live or something?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 222.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Heh, I hope your actions are as strong as that mouth of yours.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 285.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I wonder what Silver Wolf did to my sword. Can I really defeat Skott?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 101.ogg}} '''???:''' Don't worry, dear Miss March! Rest assured, we will win.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 286.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whoa! My sword is talking!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 102.ogg}} '''???:''' Greetings, Miss March 7th. I am the Tactical AI, Prome, *parenthesis* {{Rubi|Learning Edition|Unpaid Cracked Version}} *close parenthesis*. My purpose is to aid you in overcoming adversaries.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you enhance weapons?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 103.ogg}} '''Prome:''' Quite the opposite, actually. When Silver Wolf installed me into your sword, her terrible welding skills reduced the sword's impact resistance by 12 percent.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 104.ogg}} '''Prome:''' But please do not worry. I'll help you secure victory.
::Silver Wolf is simply amazing...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Silver Wolf is simply amazing...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 105.ogg}} '''Prome:''' No, Silver Wolf is not amazing at all. When Silver Wolf installed me into your sword, her terrible welding skills actually reduced the sword's impact resistance by 12 percent.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 106.ogg}} '''Prome:''' But please don't worry. I'll help you secure the victory because I actually am amazing.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 287.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh... how exactly are you going to defeat him?

Let's hear what excuses Skott can come up with.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO side2 baishi staffE 106.ogg}} '''IPC Worker (II):''' Specialist Skott, they're controlling our mechs! There's no way we can defeat them!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 227.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Heh... if we fought fair and square, you might call this a sparring session, but March 7th, your actions today have blatantly crossed the last line of the law!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 228.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You injected a virus into the IPC mechs and took control! That's an infringement of the IPC's intellectual property and assets!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 109.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' I'd be more concerned about yourself, Skott. Why were you storing your private data on an IPC computer?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 229.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Private data? I&mdash;I have no idea what you're talking about.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 110.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' No idea, huh? I noticed you paid a hefty sum for the "end-of-life data deletion" service, so I'm guessing there must be something worth seeing.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 230.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Y&mdash;You... you... you... stop! Stop right there! That's private! Who told you you could invade my privacy? Just stop it!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 111.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' What were the terms again, March?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 291.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Skott, you need to immediately apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl. You'll need to shout "IPC mechs are a total joke!" and print that on every mech on your transport ship! Oh yeah, almost forgot &mdash; you have to squeal like a pig!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 112.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' That's pretty much the same as barking like a dog, right? He's already barked like a dog, players are bored of it. Let's come up with something new... How about singing the SoulGlad jingle, but with a pig's squeal?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Players?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 113.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Oops, I meant "all of us." Sometimes I get carried away playing games &mdash; just a slip of the tongue.
::How much did SoulGlad pay you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much did SoulGlad pay you?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 114.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Sam has been humming that blasted song every day since coming back from Penacony, it's all I can hear.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 231.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Fine, you've got me... I want to apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl! It's my fault for causing trouble and making a scene on purpose!
