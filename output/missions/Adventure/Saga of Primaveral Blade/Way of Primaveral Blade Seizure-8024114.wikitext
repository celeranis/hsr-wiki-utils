===Talk to Silver Wolf{{subst:void|<!--802411401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Silver Wolf during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Silver Wolf for some advice.}}

;(Talk to Silver Wolf)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 278.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'm going up against Skott soon. I'm so nervous.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 101.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Nervous about what? Dealing with a few IPC minions is just a walk in the park.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 279.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But Skott will definitely use the IPC's mechs. There's no way I can take them down with just a couple of swords, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It wouldn't be a problem for Yanqing or Yunli.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 280.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Masters could handle them for sure! But isn't it asking too much of a poor little rookie like me?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The mechs' armor is too thick.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 281.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right? Even if Master Yanqing says there's a mechanism in this sword that helps with cutting... can it really slice through a mech?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 102.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Why focus on piercing the armor? For hackers, the ideal way to win is to infiltrate the opponent's system.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 103.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Here, give me your sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you do?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 105.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' You'll understand once the duel begins.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't you need to enhance the other sword too?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 106.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' No, when it comes to programming, less is more. Overdoing it increases the chance of creating errors.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 282.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... I can defeat him just like that?

===Go to Aurum Alley and engage in the promised duel{{subst:void|<!--802411403-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Silver Wolf pays no heed to March 7th's swordplay duel, but she implants a little something into March 7th's sword to repay her for her help in the last few days: A code that'll breach the inner defenses of an IPC Mech.<br />You have Silver Wolf's assurance that everything's going to be fine, so head over to Aurum Alley.}}

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 220.ogg}} '''Skott:''' March 7th, you're late. Here I was thinking you were too chicken to show your face. I was thinking I might have to track you down and settle the score~
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 284.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Too chicken? I was giving you the chance to back out! But you're actually insulting me now, you cheeky...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We ride a train everywhere, delays are to be expected every once in a while.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 221.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Making excuses for being late like it's no big deal? If you worked under me, I'd personally make you regret it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's the rush? You only got one day left to live or something?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 222.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Heh, I hope your actions are as strong as that mouth of yours.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 285.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I wonder what Silver Wolf did to my sword. Can I really defeat Skott?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 101.ogg}} '''???:''' Don't worry, dear Miss March! Rest assured, we will win.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 286.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Whoa! My sword is talking!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 102.ogg}} '''???:''' Greetings, Miss March 7th. I am the Tactical AI, Prome, *parenthesis* {{Rubi|Learning Edition|Unpaid Cracked Version}} *close parenthesis*. My purpose is to aid you in overcoming adversaries.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you enhance weapons?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 103.ogg}} '''Prome:''' Quite the opposite, actually. When Silver Wolf installed me into your sword, her terrible welding skills reduced the sword's impact resistance by 12 percent.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 104.ogg}} '''Prome:''' But please do not worry. I'll help you secure victory.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Silver Wolf is simply amazing...
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 105.ogg}} '''Prome:''' No, Silver Wolf is not amazing at all. When Silver Wolf installed me into your sword, her terrible welding skills actually reduced the sword's impact resistance by 12 percent.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi prome 106.ogg}} '''Prome:''' But please don't worry. I'll help you secure the victory because I actually am amazing.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 287.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Uh... how exactly are you going to defeat him?

===Go to Aurum Alley and talk to Skott{{subst:void|<!--802411404-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Silver Wolf pays no heed to March 7th's swordplay duel, but she implants a little something into March 7th's sword to repay her for her help in the last few days: A code that'll breach the inner defenses of an IPC Mech.<br />Silver Wolf's trick worked exceptionally well! Let's hear what excuses Skott can come up with.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO side2 baishi staffE 106.ogg}} '''IPC Worker (II):''' Specialist Skott, they're controlling our mechs! There's no way we can defeat them!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 227.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Heh... if we fought fair and square, you might call this a sparring session, but March 7th, your actions today have blatantly crossed the last line of the law!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 228.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You injected a virus into the IPC mechs and took control! That's an infringement of the IPC's intellectual property and assets!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 109.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' I'd be more concerned about yourself, Skott. Why were you storing your private data on an IPC computer?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 229.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Private data? I&mdash;I have no idea what you're talking about.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 110.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' No idea, huh? I noticed you paid a hefty sum for the "end-of-life data deletion" service, so I'm guessing there must be something worth seeing.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 230.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Y&mdash;You... you... you... stop! Stop right there! That's private! Who told you you could invade my privacy? Just stop it!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 111.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' What were the terms again, March?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 291.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Skott, you need to immediately apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl. You'll need to shout "IPC mechs are a total joke!" and print that on every mech on your transport ship! Oh yeah, almost forgot &mdash; you have to squeal like a pig!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 112.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' That's pretty much the same as barking like a dog, right? He's already barked like a dog, players are bored of it. Let's come up with something new... How about singing the SoulGlad jingle, but with a pig's squeal?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Players?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 113.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Oops, I meant "all of us." Sometimes I get carried away playing games &mdash; just a slip of the tongue.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much did SoulGlad pay you?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi silverwolf 114.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' Sam has been humming that blasted song every day since coming back from Penacony, it's all I can hear.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 231.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Fine, you've got me... I want to apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl! It's my fault for causing trouble and making a scene on purpose!
