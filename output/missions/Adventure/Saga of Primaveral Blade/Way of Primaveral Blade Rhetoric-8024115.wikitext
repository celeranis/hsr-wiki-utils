===Talk to Qingque{{subst:void|<!--802411501-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Qingque during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Qingque for some advice.}}

===Go to Aurum Alley and engage in the promised duel{{subst:void|<!--802411503-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Qingque believes Skott is only causing this much trouble for others because he's a diehard workaholic. And so, she volunteers to meet with Skott.<br />But Qingque isn't versed in swordplay, is she...? Could she be planning to reason with him instead? Whatever it is, let's head to Aurum Alley first.}}

And so, she volunteers to meet with Skott.<br />Qingque intends to appeal to his emotions and logic. Not... exactly optimistic about this. You and March 7th should support her as best as you can.}}
