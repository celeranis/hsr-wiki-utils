===Talk to Qingque{{subst:void|<!--802411501-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Great minds think alike. A duel victory is no longer March 7th's and your goal after all the swordplay training and adventure in the last fifteen days.<br />You've both experienced numerous "wanderlust escapades" with Qingque during this period. It could be a good idea to ask Qingque for some advice.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Qingque)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 296.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'm going up against Skott soon. Do you know why I'm visiting you, Qingque?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 101 f.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Yeah, with you, me, and (Trailblazer) here, the answer is pretty obvious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We can brainstorm ways to defeat Skott together.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 102.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' But I know nothing about swordplay or duels. Now, if you're talking about playing Celestial Jade, that's something I might be able to help with.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, we're here to play "Celestial Jade!"
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 103.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Yeah, you just have pre-fight jitters, March. Let's play a couple of rounds to help you relax.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 297.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wait a minute! I've been playing with you a lot lately, right? I've actually picked up a few insights. For example, I've been thinking lately that just defeating Skott with my swords might not be enough...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You? Thinking?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 298.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Yeah. You don't really think I'm dumb, do you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Care to share your insights?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 299.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, here's the thing. Even if Skott apologizes, do you think he'd actually feel sorry for what he did?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 104.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Nah, it's more he's just honoring a bet. Whether it's apologizing or squealing like a pig, I doubt he'd do it willingly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Remember when he barked like a dog? He definitely wasn't sorry then.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 300.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Exactly! He just wants to show off, which is why he picked Aurum Alley as the venue.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But defeating him like this would feel pretty satisfying!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 301.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' True heroes in Immersia don't merely settle for "satisfying!"
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 105.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' ...You're right. Even though I'm not a fan, I'll help you figure something out.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 302 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 302 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), why don't you fill her in on what happened at Aurum Alley earlier?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, any suggestions on what to do?
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 107.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' I don't have suggestions, only an opinion, and that is "He's a hopeless workaholic."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He deserves a good scolding!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 108.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Skott really needs to apologize to regular people like me.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 109.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Come on, March! Let's go find him!

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 239.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Well, well, if it isn't our hero March 7th! And who do we have here with you...?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 110.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Before you start the fight, I have a few words for you.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 240.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Huh...!? Who do you think you are? Is it like a Xianzhou thing to just show up uninvited?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 111 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 111 f.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' It's okay if you don't know who I am. Introduce me to him, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is the CEO of the Dynasty Corp, Miss Qingque!
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 112.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Don't freak him out. I work as the head of the Divination Commission most of the time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is Qingque, a renowned diviner from the Divination Commission.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 113.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' Yep, you're welcome to check out my credentials in the Divination Commission.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 241.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Heh, what's so special about being a diviner from the Divination Commission? I'm a specialist at the Interastral Peace Corporation! Tell me, what makes you think you're so great? Do you have more minions than me? Or do you earn more credits?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 114.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' You may not be young, but {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|your mindset is still that of a fresh-faced newbie}} who spends all their time on work, while proudly proclaiming to "love their job."
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 242.ogg}} '''Skott:''' You... shut up, you!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi qingque 115.ogg}} '''Qingque:''' In my opinion, you enjoy playing the role of a joker, spouting off outrageous opinions just to seem objective and indifferent whenever you feel like it.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 243.ogg}} '''Skott:''' E&mdash;Enough! Shut up! What do you know about me!? Don't act like you know everything!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 304.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wow, you really got under Skott's skin with just a few words.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 244.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Well, you almost got me. I'm here to... have a duel, not to debate with you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Skott got hit where it hurts.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 305.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah, Skott couldn't come up with a comeback.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Diviners are indeed not to be trifled with.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 306.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'd better not mess with the Divination Commission anymore.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this really the same harmless little sparrow we all know? More like one ferocious eagle.
::{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 307.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I guess not! Eagle sounds about right.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 308.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's the spirit! Strike while the iron is hot!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, I know a thing or two about convincing Skott...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me! I'm an expert negotiator!
