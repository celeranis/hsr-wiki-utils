:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 102.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Stop, don't call me a "guest." You're not even treating me as one. I want my tea just right, not too hot, not too cold, but the tea you served was either freezing or scalding! Is this how you treat your guests on the Xianzhou? How fantastic!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 103.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Your tea tastes like slop, and you even have the nerve to charge me for it! Are you trying to scam honest folks!?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 104.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And that name, "The Sleepless Earl," it's so hard to remember. How about we give you a new plaque that says "Xianzhou Slop?" It suits this place better, don't you think?

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 107.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Trouble? Hah! I'm just giving some feedback as a regular customer. The tea here is terrible, and now the Cloud Knights want to stop me from complaining about it? At this rate, who would want to ever come here for tea in the future?

:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 110.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Swordplay? Oh, I get it now. It's just another kind of play, right? That explains why you're dressed like you're in a show. You're not even from the Xianzhou, so why bother learning their swordplay? If you're feeling unsafe, I can sell you an IPC mech.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Pfft! As if anyone wants your junkyard scrap mechs!

:{{A|VO side2 baishi yunli 113.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Make any funny moves, and I'll smash those hunks of scrap metal.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 114.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Hey, hey, relax. I know the rules. These are my subordinates. They got stuck here because of the transport ship incident, and they need to vent their frustration... In the end, it's all the Xianzhou's fault.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 115.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Well, I can overlook the terrible tea, but now that you're questioning my security, I can't let it slide. After all, I have a courier business to run, and with so many clients watching, that just wouldn't look too good now, would it?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 116.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Instead of wasting your life learning useless swordplay, why not invest in our civilian mechs? You'll have your master kneeling and begging for mercy in no time.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 129.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Stop! Don't you dare insult Xianzhou swordplay like that! If you have the guts, I'll show your mechs what I can do!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 117.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Huh...!? A fight, you say? Hahahahaha! Now that you've thrown down the gauntlet, March 7th, I feel I'm obliged to accept your challenge!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 118.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Say whatever you want, but once you've seen what our mechs can do, you'll be practically begging us for them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's make a bet.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 119.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, come on, how could I say no to a bet?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 120.ogg}} '''Skott:''' So, I can see you're no master yet, March, but I'll play fair. You go back and learn swordplay from your teachers here, and in fifteen days, I'll come find you and challenge you with my mechs.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 130.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Only fifteen days? Alright... fine!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 121.ogg}} '''Skott:''' And if you lose, you'll have to bark like a dog in public and shout, "Xianzhou swordplay is a total joke!" You'll stand at the entrance of Aurum Alley and say it to everyone passing by.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 122.ogg}} '''Skott:''' Oh, and if that's the case, just forget about your master and become my apprentice instead! I'll teach you how to pilot a mech!
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' And... if I win?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 123.ogg}} '''Skott:''' I'll become your apprentice?
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Nah, I don't think so. I don't like you.
:{{A|VO side2 baishi scott 124.ogg}} '''Skott:''' ...Okay, how about this? If I lose, I'll squeal like a pig in public and say, "IPC mechs are a total joke!" And I'll even print that on every mech on the transport ship. Deal?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, he just changed "barking" into "squealing" and that's supposed to be a different story?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Feel like this has happened before...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your bets always sound so childish...
:{{A|VO side2 baishi mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Squealing isn't enough! You also need to apologize to the owner of the Sleepless Earl, and take back what you said about Xianzhou swordplay!
