{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Those who pursue the art of swordplay know to set goals for themselves, for they would have worked toward these goals even if they are never achieved eventually. March 7th's interest in swordplay came about from the Xianzhou's novels and immersia, which nurtured her fantasy of roaming the world as a great swordswoman.<br />To fully play out the role of a swordswoman, she has to first be taken under the wing of a swordmaster.}}

March 7th and Skott end up making a pact to cross swords in fifteen days.<br />The way you went to Mengming's aid was exactly what swordmasters would do. Don't stop now, go over and comfort the young innkeeper of the Sleepless Earl.}}
