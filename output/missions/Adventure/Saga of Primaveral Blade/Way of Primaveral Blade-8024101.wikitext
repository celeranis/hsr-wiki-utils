===Go to the Palace of Astrum's backyard and check in on March 7th's swordplay training===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Let us revisit the time when March 7th received a gift from her two young mentors. Accepting the pair of swords made her soar with anticipation as she imagined herself becoming a chivalrous swordsmaster, much like those depicted in immersia.<br />How about taking this opportunity to follow March 7th on her journey of mastering swordplay?}}

===Go to the Sleepless Earl and prepare to join a discipleship ceremony===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Those who pursue the art of swordplay know to set goals for themselves, for they would have worked toward these goals even if they are never achieved eventually. March 7th's interest in swordplay came about from the Xianzhou's novels and immersia, which nurtured her fantasy of roaming the world as a great swordswoman.<br />To fully play out the role of a swordswoman, she has to first be taken under the wing of a swordmaster.}}

===Talk to Mengming===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Alas, adversaries are wont to cross paths! The both of you encounter Skott, who is up to no good yet again. March 7th and Skott end up making a pact to cross swords in fifteen days.<br />The way you went to Mengming's aid was exactly what swordmasters would do. Don't stop now, go over and comfort the young innkeeper of the Sleepless Earl.}}
