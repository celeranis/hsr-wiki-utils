::'''Screwllum:''' The experience went smoothly, I assume, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer).
::'''Screwllum:''' Even if the wings of butterflies can sway a hurricane, its beauty needs to be adorned with foliage and flora. During your test, I borrowed the Divergent Universe's resources and spruced up (The Radiant Feldspar/The Trailblaze's Stern/The Tatalov/The Soaring Clock Hand) lobby.
::'''Screwllum:''' From many academic perspectives, art is a perception reserved exclusively for organic life, just like this splendorous dream.
::'''Screwllum:''' In my opinion, even if this concept was borne of a subjective feeling of organic life, the pantheon of art does not discriminate against any of its guests.
::'''Screwllum:''' Suggestion: Use both your hands to arrange these art pieces, to adorn this voyage of the mortal pursuit.

:'''Screwllum:''' There are also plenty of painting frames by the art display.
::'''Screwllum:''' Here's another interesting tidbit: The stories you've encountered during the test will be extracted in section by the system, then recorded in the form of a painting.
::'''Screwllum:''' You agree to decide their display placement as you deem fit.
::'''Screwllum:''' These intersecting anecdotes of infinitesimal odds will one day fill this entire art gallery.
::'''Screwllum:''' Assessment: From the analysis of organic life's psychological perspective, the sequence of the art pieces will reflect one's personality and mode of thinking.
::'''Screwllum:''' I very much look forward to the variables that you will generate, and the shape or form in which they may present themselves.
