:'''Immortal in a Vase:''' An eternity in the celestial realm, a millennium gone in a flash. {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young man}}, you've come back. You brought me some of the hustle and bustle of humanity last time. Thanks to you, my vase has everything now.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' You really should come in and see the world inside this vase. I call it my Cage of Freedom. Go on. Are you coming in for a look or not?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? There's no way the Trailblazer can fit in there!
:::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' Hahaha, really? That's because you still have mortal worries inside of you. Embrace the formless and shrug off thy mortal shell, then change into a thousand forms as thy mind desires.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Reach in with your hand.)
:::Last time, you easily reached into the vase and took out the Immortal's gift. But this time, your hand gets caught on the mouth of the vase. That's normal &mdash; how could a human hand hope to fit into such a small vase?
:::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' Can't fit? Haha... That's because you still have mortal worries inside of you. Embrace the formless and shrug off thy mortal shell, then change into a thousand forms as thy mind desires.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Stick your head in.)
:::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' The Immortal has miraculous powers, and it may be able to include you in the vase. But somehow, your head gets caught on the mouth of the vase. That's normal &mdash; how could a human head hope to fit into such a small vase?
:::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' Can't fit? Haha... That's because you still have mortal worries inside of you. Embrace the formless and shrug off thy mortal shell, then change into a thousand forms as thy mind desires.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' In this case... I actually have a request. There're some things on you that's preventing you from shrugging off your mortal shell, but are in fact quite useful to me.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' It's because of those things that you have to busy yourself in the mortal realm. You could've put your own satisfaction first, instead of wasting this short life of yours on your companions.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' But it's just what I need in this world inside my vase. That "hustle and bustle of humankind" is growing rampantly, filling every spot in this vase &mdash; but it doesn't recognize who is the real owner of this Cage of Freedom.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' I want you to hand those things over to me. Help me, and perhaps you'll be helping yourself.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't understand. What do you mean?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sound like the Riddlers...
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' It can shed the skin of beasts, teach aquatic bugs to live on land, and disappear without being seen. This strange thing cannot be provoked.
::'''Immortal in a Vase:''' It doesn't matter if you don't understand. Just stand there, and don't move. I'll get it myself.
