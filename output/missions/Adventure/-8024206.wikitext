:You see a person and a trashcan standing on the platform in front of the orphanage, laughing and talking as they stare into the distance.
::'''Bronya:''' (Trailblazer), it's been a while! Please say hello to the Express Crew for me when you see them.
::'''Bronya:''' Mr. Litter Pony has explained the situation to me. Fortunately, it seems there is a solution to all these recent strange happenings. Looks like we're counting on you once more.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Piece of cake.
:::'''Bronya:''' I'd like to thank you for all your effort too, Mr. Pony... Thank you for thinking of Belobog's safety.
:::I'm being forced to do this.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm being forced to do this.
::'''Bronya:''' But the fact that you have chosen to be here now proves that you are still willing to help Belobog resolve this problem, wouldn't you agree?
::'''Litter Pony:''' My friend, it is okay to take credit for good deeds! Just admit that you are the kind of person that is extremely concerned for others!
::'''Bronya:''' When you mentioned the Magic of Friendship, so many memories came flooding back to me. Before I knew it, I had been talking non-stop for ages with Mr. Pony. Sorry for getting carried away and rambling.
::'''Litter Pony:''' I was honored that you would share all this with me... This elegant young lady has made a new, like-minded friend and has been able to reunite with an old one, too.
::'''Bronya:''' Every experience is truly a Proof of Friendship that should be treasured. I have learned a lot through meeting all of you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like how to unite our efforts with our hearts aligned.
:::Bronya laughs softly and begins to reminisce about how your hearts were aligned and your efforts were united on your journey to save Belobog together...
:::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains Bronya's Magic of Friendship.
:::Like how to swear in foul language.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Like how to swear in foul language.
::Bronya laughs softly and begins to talk about Seele's tireless efforts to teach her "foul language"...
::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains Bronya's Magic of Friendship.
::'''Bronya:''' This picture on Mr. Litter Pony's body... is that me?
::'''Litter Pony:''' That's right. I will also inherit part of your combat style.
::'''Litter Pony:''' (Trailblazer), are you ready?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Enter Battle)

;(Talk to Bronya)
:'''Bronya:''' If you bring Seele along, I'm curious about how her abstract portrait would look like... Actually, the more I talk about it, the more I want to see it. If it's not too much trouble, would you take me with you to see her?

;(Talk to Bronya)
:'''Bronya:''' This fighting style... I never imagined that I would have such an extreme side.
:You feel like you can see the shadow of someone else...
