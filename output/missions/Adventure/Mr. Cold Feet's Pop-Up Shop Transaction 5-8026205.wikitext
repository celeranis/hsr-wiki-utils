{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sampo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620103--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620201-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620203--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620301-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Business people like us are all about buying things from one place and selling them to other places. You might think that this meme isn't working out in Belobog, but someone might actually love it on some other planet.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620303--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620401-->)
::'''Sampo:''' I jest, but the Knights of Beauty are most deserving of my utmost admiration. There are only two types of people as steadfast as them: Idiots and fools.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' Salutations, my dear Nameless &mdash; though we meet every day. Today's product is a bit special. You'll never guess what {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Feathers of Flame}} and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Basic Ingredients}} can be combined into. Shall we begin?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bring it on.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's talk about this deal.
::'''Sampo:''' If people get too obsessed with the outcome, they'll be driven mad. In other words, this thing's pretty dangerous. Let me teach you some tricks to avoid its influence.
::'''Sampo:''' To become more open-minded, one must first learn to be self-deprecating. If there ever comes a time when you're trapped in mental torment without hope of escape...
::'''Sampo:''' Just muster the courage to complain about your dinner, for it's always such a let-down!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
