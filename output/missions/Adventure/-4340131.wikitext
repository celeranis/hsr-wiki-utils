;(Talk to Cycrane with a sense of duty)
:'''Cycrane with a sense of duty:''' Hello, hello. I keep getting the feeling that someone's hiding here. Can you help me find that person?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you mean?
::'''Cycrane with a sense of duty:''' It's exactly as I said, I think that someone's hiding here and watching me from the shadows. It's gotten my steel feathers somewhat ruffled, but I can't seem to find anything.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why aren't you looking then?
::'''Cycrane with a sense of duty:''' I can't find anything, that's why I'm asking you. I get the feeling that someone's hiding here and watching me from the shadows &mdash; it's gotten me a little anxious.
:'''Cycrane with a sense of duty:''' Just see it as doing a good deed in passing. You can borrow my bird and take a look around. Once you've found that '''hidden person''', please bring me along.
