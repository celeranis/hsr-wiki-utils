{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Supply Zone|update|You planned to finish the investigation as soon as possible after checking Mare's data record. Unfortunately, the terminal's network signal is so poor that you have to ask for the engineer's help again...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Maintenance Engineer)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' What's wrong?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I only found one record.
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Good... Oh, you mean you couldn't find the others?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Insufficient computing power. Try again later?"
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Oh, that's normal. The terminal is not broken. It's nothing to worry about.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Although, it won't be operational until tomorrow.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Because the station was invaded. Originally, we had more than one terminal, connecting units on a much larger scale.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' During that debacle, some units were damaged. The computing power of the terminal was thus greatly decreased, not to mention it's only running on a single-core processor right now...
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' The lead researcher said she was going to purchase new equipment. But it hasn't arrived yet. Therefore, with the current computing power, you can only query once a day.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' And the current identity verification program has to be activated manually by me every day, so... please {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|come back tomorrow}}. Don't forget to ask me to turn on the verification.
