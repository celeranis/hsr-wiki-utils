{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Maintenance Engineer)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' What's wrong?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I only found one record.
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Good... Oh, you mean you couldn't find the others?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Insufficient computing power. Try again later?"
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Oh, that's normal. The terminal is not broken. It's nothing to worry about.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Although, it won't be operational until tomorrow.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Because the station was invaded. Originally, we had more than one terminal, connecting units on a much larger scale.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' During that debacle, some units were damaged. The computing power of the terminal was thus greatly decreased, not to mention it's only running on a single-core processor right now...
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' The lead researcher said she was going to purchase new equipment. But it hasn't arrived yet. Therefore, with the current computing power, you can only query once a day.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' And the current identity verification program has to be activated manually by me every day, so... please {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|come back tomorrow}}. Don't forget to ask me to turn on the verification.
