{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|It's time to go listen to what Mr. Xiyan will make up for the next part of the story. Hopefully he'll hold himself back this time and don't write any more ridiculous twists and turns... Never mind. That's not gonna happen.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|Mr. Xiyan invites you to meet him at Scalegorge Waterscape and says he prepared a "small surprise" for you. This sounds incredibly fishy, but he would never dare to hurt you out of all people. Just go.}}

===Forge "divine weapons" with the high elder===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Under Mr. Xiyan's direction, you're going to be playing against this "high elder" and drawing a perfect conclusion for this legendary tale. Thankfully this old thespian seems a little more reliable than Mr. Xiyan.}}

===The divine weapon is complete. It's time to head to the final battle===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The divine weapon has been completed, and victory is within reach. Mr. Xiyan is becoming more and more excited as he tells the story. His eyes are open wide as saucers and his voice gets louder and louder: "At this time, there is only one thought in (Trailblazer)'s head &mdash; The Lord Ravager must be destroyed so the Xianzhou can remain in peace."}}
