{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|Under Mr. Xiyan's direction, you're going to be playing against this "high elder" and drawing a perfect conclusion for this legendary tale. Thankfully this old thespian seems a little more reliable than Mr. Xiyan.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|The divine weapon has been completed, and victory is within reach. Mr. Xiyan is becoming more and more excited as he tells the story.
