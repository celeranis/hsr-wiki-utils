;(Talk to "Spirithief" Bartholos)
----
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' S&mdash;So this is your home?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' It was completely vacant the last time I was here. You were moved in before Aquila could blink. I just came to take a look around and honestly, honestly&mdash;
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did I invite you here?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Haha, isn't it luxurious?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' It's far too extravagant in here! The stench of its opulence and lavishness makes me sick!
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' While I was making my way through wind and rain, you were here living it up in a mansion, throwing back ambrosia, and living the good life?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' What is even more loathsome is that you live in such radiant luxury and would still squabble with me over a mere chest... Just the excess that leaks from the gaps in your teeth would keep me clothed and fed for a whole year.
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Is there any fairness in this world? Is there any justice? Are there no laws anymore? If Talanton knew of this, they would burst into tears!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton has no interest in this.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' I don't care if Talanton has no interest, but my interest is fixed now! Hehe. If you dare stand in my way, you'd best be prepared to pay the price!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you want to stay here, you can come whenever you please.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Huh? Uh... Are you serious? I'm not so free and easy as to just... Wait a minute. Are you making fun of me?
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' I'm the one that makes fun of others. No one has ever done it to me before... Hehe, you will pay for this!
