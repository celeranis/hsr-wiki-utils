;(Talk to Kelok)
:{{tx}}
:'''Kelok:''' Oho, it's you, dear customer! Long time!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've been released?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you two doing together again?
:'''Kelok:''' Those Talanton disciples bickered for a long time in the citizens' assembly, not knowing how to decide the case. Finally, we were declared innocent by a vote's difference, so we just paid the fine. It was a harrowing experience.
:'''Kilik:''' With your blessing, we discovered that there was an equally shrewd talent in Okhema! We hit it off instantly, and decided to do business together.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you intending to sell this time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Only honest trade, of course!
:'''Kelok:''' Speaking of that, we should really ask your opinion.
:'''Kelok:''' What business do you think is good now? Lamps that have had {{Rubi|Aquila's|Sky Titan}} eyes gazed upon them, or silks dyed by {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}}?
:'''Kilik:''' As long as we can spin, the world is paved with opportunity!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's truly no hope for you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just wait till you get caught again!
:'''Kelok:''' Haha, earning our pots of gold is inevitable now that we're working together. You just wait for our good news!
