;(Talk to Serena)
:{{tx}}
:'''Serena:''' What a great day, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}. How many breaking news alerts do you plan on listening to?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where did you hear about these wild rumors?
::'''Serena:''' Wild rumors? So long as there's one person who hasn't heard of something, it's all news!
::We all use teleslates nowadays. What are you talking about newspapers for?
::'''Serena:''' Who said I'm talking about a newspaper? Paper's too expensive &mdash; every line of this news is personally delivered by my mouth~
::I've got plenty of news myself, too. Name your price.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We all use teleslates nowadays. What are you talking about newspapers for?
::'''Serena:''' Who said I'm talking about a newspaper? Paper's too expensive &mdash; every line of this news is personally delivered by my mouth~
::I've got plenty of news myself, too. Name your price.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got plenty of news myself, too. Name your price.
:'''Serena:''' Hey, don't get me wrong now &mdash; I only sell news. I'm not into recycling it.
:'''Serena:''' We're having a sale to mark the grand opening: One line of news for just 5 Balance Coins. Want to hear one?
:The girl looks at you with puppy dog eyes that seem to say "I'll starve if I don't sell any news stories today."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go!!!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't tell me there's no option to refuse?
::That's right, could anyone ever hope to refuse that girl with those puppy dog eyes? Besides, you're so rich now that you can afford the price of ten news items.
:'''Serena:''' Tee-hee, thank you so much. Well then, I'll begin...

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:Inside the bamboo basket lies a few cheap gemstones, a pieced-together porcelain vase, and various other loose items... So many things, all mixed together, like birds building up a nest.
:Most things are worth at least a little money, but not much &mdash; barely enough to buy a shield and spear. Their owner seems only interested in collecting things &mdash; and has clearly been doing so for some time.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I hear that kid is hiding on the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|platform opposite}}. I can go around the roof to get there.
