:A single cushion catches your attention. Its presence seems clearly out of place with its surroundings.
:Under your careful observation, you notice that the surface of the cushion is a little strange... Logically, a cushion should be soft inside, but this cushion has something very hard sticking out of it.
:You decide to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How strange. This requires thorough inspection.
::After great effort, you finally manage to tear off the cushion's cover as a scroll falls out from inside.

::After great effort, you finally manage to tear off the cushion's cover as a scroll falls out from inside.
::A simple but strange pattern is drawn on the base of the scroll: An eye formed of branches staring at a divine statue ensnared in vines.
::From the content recorded inside, it seems that these are instructions for some kind of mysterious ceremony, attached with notes made by disciples.
::This scroll has aroused your curiosity. Though you have experienced all sorts of summoning ceremonies inside Okhema, this will be the first that you have experienced personally from the beginning.
::...Will you try it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Couldn't hurt, I guess!
:::Having made up your mind to carry out the ceremony personally, you begin to carefully study the contents of the scroll.
:::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Exit}} Forget it. Something doesn't feel right about this...
:::Of course, any exploration comes with risk, especially when it is directly linked to Titans and gods. Your caution is understandable. Maybe it's best to leave the scroll where you found it and make a quick exit.

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location="Eternal Holy City" Okhema|update|Unexpectedly, you come across an ancient scroll in Okhema, detailing a mystical ceremony. Follow the instructions carefully and gather all the necessary materials. What will be summoned at the designated location?}}

:The tree trunk is engraved with the mark of Cerces. As so many years have passed, only a thin layer of the original engraving remains, making it hard to notice at first sight.
:Comparing the location with the scroll's script, you are certain that this is the location for the mysterious ceremony. There is something strange about the dirt beneath you. Perhaps the countless ceremonies performed here before have hardened the earth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bury the offerings by the tree roots.
