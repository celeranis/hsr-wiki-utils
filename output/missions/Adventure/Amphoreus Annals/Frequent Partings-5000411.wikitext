:'''Hyacine:''' Oh, Grayie! Good to see you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You need something?
:'''Hyacine:''' Well, you see. During my treatment of a wounded from the Grove, I found a letter that appeared to be from a scholar to his wife.

;(Talk to Titus)

::You tell the man everything you saw in the memory, describing each moment in precise detail.
::'''Titus:''' Nowhere to go? What nonsense! Has he truly lost his mind? Can't even make up a decent excuse...
::'''Titus:''' And those legs he complains about? Last time I accidentally broke his favorite pipe, he chased me through half the Grove!
::'''Titus:''' Now suddenly he's a burden? Ha! When he should be stubborn, he gives in... That old fool, where was all this consideration during our arguments?
::'''Titus:''' ...
::'''Titus:''' Gods, I should've just dragged him back home with me... I got him this perfect house, right between the marketplace and the baths. Premium location, didn't spare any expense. Even built him a private library in the courtyard...
::'''Titus:''' All that care... all that money... Do you know how much money I wasted for that, old fool? Gods! It hurts just talking about it...
::'''Titus:''' Why didn't you... *sniff* try staying in that house for once...
::The anger in his voice shatters like glass, grief pouring through as his shoulders shake with silent sobs.
::You suddenly feel a pressure on your chest &mdash; like your clothes suddenly all became drenched in water and are sticking suffocatingly to your skin...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sorry for your loss...
::'''Titus:''' *bitter, choked laugh* Thanks, really... but I'll be fine. Could you... could you just give me a moment?
::{{tx}}
----
::'''Titus:''' You stubborn old man... Do you even know how much that house cost? Why didn't you... *sniff* try staying in there for once...
::'''Titus:''' *sniffles*...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was no challenge at all!

::'''Titus:''' ...
::'''Titus:''' That stubborn old fool, always clinging to the Grove, treating Okhema like it's poison to him.
::'''Titus:''' Now thanks to this little trip, I've burned through three years of saved vacation time, and my poor piggy bank's almost empty...
::'''Titus:''' Say, my friend &mdash; they say you can wield Oronyx's divine power, is that true?
::'''Titus:''' If so, could you help me out? Check if the old man left anything behind &mdash; I'll owe you one, and we can discuss payment...
::'''Titus:''' S&mdash;Sorry... it's not much, but once I'm back in Okhema, just name your price!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No need to pay me...
:::'''Titus:''' Please, I insist. I won't feel right if you don't take it, really.
