:'''Hekate:''' Don't worry. I'll be there as soon as I can.
:'''Demetria:''' Great... Good kid, thank you very much. You can blame everything on me for being so useless. I'll just be a burden once we leave the city...
:'''Hekate:''' Please don't say that, Aunty Demetria. You just hold on, and I'll be right back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Something wrong?
:'''Demetria:''' ...Ah, it's you there, youngster. Sorry, but I have something urgent on today, so I'm not opening up for a while...
:'''Hekate:''' Are you... an esteemed guest from the outlands? I've heard about you... someone who can use the power of Oronyx to observe the past.
:'''Hekate:''' Can I hire you for something? It's an easy job: Accompany me around town and use your powers to investigate a few things. We can haggle about compensation.
:'''Demetria:''' Come on, I should be the one giving payment... But would you be willing to consider our assignment?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Give me some of the details first.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll make that call.
:'''Demetria:''' Fine... My daughter Possephone left town about six months ago with her husband &mdash; Hadez &mdash; and an expedition team, and they have yet to return.
:'''Demetria:''' Based on reports from other members of the team, just as they were all about to head back, she and Hadez said they wanted to go back for more samples. They split off from the team for just a moment, but didn't make it back to the meeting spot at the agreed time.
:'''Demetria:''' Worried something had happened to them, the other team members frantically searched the area but were unluckily met with monsters of the black tide, which forced them to flee for the time being. They went back many times later, and I've been looking for them everywhere too, but...
:'''Demetria:''' And then just yesterday I had this dream... where they were arguing in a makeshift camp they'd rigged together... which might be where they disappeared to back then &mdash; i&mdash;it had to be a revelation sent to me by Oronyx...
:'''Hekate:''' Once she heard about this, Aunty Demetria asked a few more adventurers to go find them, and... they really did find a makeshift camp jury-rigged together just like in the dream... but with nobody in it.
:'''Demetria:''' So I asked Hekate to check in on things for me... No matter what, I just need a resolution for myself...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am duty-bound to do honorable things.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then step aside for the Galactic Baseballer. I'm as good as two where it counts.
::'''Demetria:''' ...I don't really understand what you're saying, but I believe you're in agreement, aren't you, youngster?
:'''Demetria:''' Thank you, thank you... Thank you... Please be careful out there. Come back safely... I'll be waiting...

:'''Hekate:''' First, Possephone noticed dodgy supplies sent to the expedition team, traced it back to Rhadaman, and secured ironclad evidence of his guilt. However, during this process, Rhadaman came to learn about everything.
:'''Hekate:''' Sensing potential danger, Possephone followed Hadez out of the city to escape and had no idea that her husband was actually caught up in everything.
:'''Hekate:''' While outside the city, Possephone learned the truth about Hadez being in cahoots with Rhadaman, and she was threatened. She secretly recorded some evidence and planned on using wandering Titankin as a distraction to make her escape. However...
:'''Hekate:''' Anyway, the camp was attacked and Hadez tried using a "Light of Aquila" to send for help &mdash; never realizing that he was in fact using dodgy supplies himself...
:'''Hekate:''' That's my analysis of the situation... Anything else to add?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not for now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think that covers everything.
:'''Hekate:''' Okay, let's head back then. Aunty Demetria is still waiting for us.
