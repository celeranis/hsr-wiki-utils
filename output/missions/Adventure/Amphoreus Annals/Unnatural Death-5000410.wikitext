:::'''Despairing Scholar:''' The black-clad swordmaster followed closely, overwhelming all those who still dared to resist.
:::'''Despairing Scholar:''' He's not just a mindless beast. He was on a mission to obliterate the Grove!
:::This terrain's a natural choke point. Set up some laser cannons from the world beyond the sky on both sides, and we'd have an impenetrable defensive position.
:::Unfortunately, there are no useful defensive facilities here, and the black tide's method of advance is far beyond what ordinary military forces can handle.
:::The only thing that the martyred can do is to use their lives in desperate combat to delay for a very limited time.
:::Before the flood of despair submerges people up to their necks, the roof is their only hope.
:::People pray to their gods here, believing in the 'Leap of Faith' as if it were a lifeline, hoping that it truly exists.
:::The cruel part is... even the most unwavering faith cannot overcome the limits of "this existence" itself.
