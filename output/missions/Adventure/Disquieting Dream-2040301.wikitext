:You Okhemans are so slothful! Has Kephale never taught you the virtue of punctuality in your labors?
:According to the School of Relative Cognition's First Law of Waiting, when you wait without purpose, the relative time your brain experiences will experience a state of exponential increase.
:You decide to give your brain some exercise and pass the time. You remember who we're looking for, (Trailblazer)?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hypatia.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have no idea.

:The lingering memories fade into the air. From today on, Pasithea's dreams will not be haunted by the echoes of "the ghost" anymore.
:Pasithea's lips curl up then inwards. She clenches her jaw, fighting to hold back her tears.
:'''Pasithea:''' ...
:'''Pasithea:''' I've never once thought this would be the truth. My mother... the last time I saw her, I wasn't {{Rubi|Oronyx's|Time Titan}} Holy Maiden yet.
:'''Pasithea:''' My friend, how did my mother's figure look?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Healthy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Skinny.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I couldn't see clearly.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There will be a chance to make amends.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one can escape destiny.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have both already transcended destiny.

:'''Enthusiastic Citizen:''' Outlander friend, I see you've been waiting long. You must be seeking a prophecy from the Oracle Dreammother?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know where she has gone?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ugh, don't tell me there's a queue.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello, Pasithea.
::'''Enthusiastic Citizen:''' How would I dare be mentioned on equal stature with the Oracle Dreammother? In the presence of her erudition, I am but a leaf in Cerces' forest.
:'''Dignified Citizen:''' Don't panic. Please allow us a moment of your time to introduce Pasithea &mdash; our prophet.
:'''Enthusiastic Citizen:''' None knows of her past. She emerged from the ruins of Janusopolis, leading refugees across the black tide.
:'''Dignified Citizen:''' She foresaw the trails of the future in her dreams, and hand-picked those summoned by destiny, bestowing prophecies upon them, to guide the lost through the fog.
:'''Enthusiastic Citizen:''' We even once suspected her to be one of the Chrysos Heirs because of her blind eyes. Either that, or one of {{Rubi|Oronyx's|Time Titan}} kin.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sound a lot like a drama troupe.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not paying a dime, even if your singing is fantastic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stop ruining the sci-fi theme of this story!
:'''Silent Citizen:''' Anyway, she's a good person. If she didn't remind me to return home earlier, my daughter would have been summoned to {{Rubi|Thanatos'|Death Titan}} kingdom by the fire.
:'''Enthusiastic Citizen:''' She even had an old person go to Okhema's city gates on the first day of the Month of Cultivation. There, he found the two brothers he thought lost during the war.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you even seen her before?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you seen her before?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've already washed my face.
::'''Scornful Citizen:''' Are you deaf or dumb? I'm telling you not to listen to that drivel. So-called prophecies are nothing but honeyed lies.
::Hello, Pasithea.
::'''Scornful Citizen:''' Tsk, no wonder you're foolish enough to believe this supposed Oracle Dreammother &mdash; your eyes are just as useless as hers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello, Pasithea.
::'''Scornful Citizen:''' Tsk, no wonder you're foolish enough to believe this supposed Oracle Dreammother &mdash; your eyes are just as useless as hers.
:'''Scornful Citizen:''' It'll be too late if you want to meet Pasithea. When I arrived, I happened to witness the city guards escorting that scoundrel away.
:'''Scornful Citizen:''' So many years, and someone smart finally saw through her tricks.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this what schadenfreude means?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've also been suspicious, actually.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why couldn't I be the one who thwarted her!
:'''Scornful Citizen:''' Before Janusopolis was destroyed, the priests of the Temple of the Three Fates frequently concocted prophecies, colluding with those scummy politicians.

:'''Lazing Guard:''' Isn't this Lady Aglaea's guest? What matter of business do you have here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} An honor to meet you, Pasithea.
::'''Lazing Guard:''' {{MC|f=Ma'am|m=Sir}}, just look at my burly build. I didn't even shave properly. How can I possibly be associated with that Dreammother?
::I'm looking for Pasithea.
::Pasithea, I'm here to save you!
::'''Lazing Guard:''' {{MC|f=Ma'am|m=Sir}}, I think you're mistaken.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm looking for Pasithea.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pasithea, I'm here to save you!
::'''Lazing Guard:''' {{MC|f=Ma'am|m=Sir}}, I think you're mistaken.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' If you're looking for Lady Pasithea, she has left. Judging by her troubled look, it's likely caused by that dream.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' It's also our fault, as we often trouble her to assist us for our work, yet we can hardly help her when it comes to her work. Janusopolis' Ghost... It would be great if we can catch it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ghost?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm familiar with this. Are we going ghostbusting?
::'''Lazing Guard:''' *sigh* Please don't tease us.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' Speaking of this "ghost," you could say it and I are old acquaintances.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' When the black tide descended, my father took me and escaped. But, the danger was greater than we could ever imagine.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' The people with us disappeared one by one in the darkness. Hunger and fear gradually turned into despair. But then, {{Rubi|Oronyx's|Time Titan}} Titankin appeared in front of us.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' It said that, within the dilapidated Temple of the Three Fates, a prophet named Pasithea was waiting for us. She will bring a prophecy from the Fate Titans, leading us to Okhema.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' Whatever happened next was exactly what the Titankin said. We found her among the ruins, and she saved us with her prophecy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This ghostly person seems quite nice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The tone of the story has shifted.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't this a really positive vibe?
:'''Lazing Guard:''' If things just ended there, it would have been fine. But since then, Pasithea often hears its voice in her dreams. Year after year, it's like a ghost haunting her.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' We've also tried returning to the Abyss of Fate, looking for that Titankin, but it was all in vain.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There may be another hidden reason...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So many twists and turns.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've gotten goosebumps.
:'''Lazing Guard:''' After arriving at Okhema, Lady Pasithea quickly integrated herself. She offers her help to those chosen by destiny and routinely bestows her prophecies on us, just like today.

:Some memories in this world are so chaotic that they can reversely devour the observer's consciousness. Unfortunately, your Memokeeper friends haven't yet taught you that fact.
:Helpless and unprotected, fear and fatigue assault you. As long as you close your eyes and let your soul sink into the ever-night, then all these woes will fade away.
:Pasithea, open your eyes. What did you see in Oronyx's prophecy?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Inescapable death.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The eternally silent black tide.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A corrupted and ailing world.
:But this should not be your end. Destiny will not treat you so unfairly. Do you not think it owes you a future?
:If you did not become the Holy Maiden then, would everything have turned out differently? Unfettered, free among the free, like a bird.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I might have become a craftsman.
::Craftsmanship is common work for Mountain Dwellers. But who knows? You might turn out to be an excellent craftsman.
::The weapons you forge will behead monsters, and the ballads of bards will forever laud your name.
::I might have become a scholar.

:Glory will follow your path, and after that, your heroism will be etched in epitaphs.
:But all this will not come to pass. You are just Pasithea, the Holy Maiden of the Temple of the Three Fates. A prisoner without dignity or freedom.
