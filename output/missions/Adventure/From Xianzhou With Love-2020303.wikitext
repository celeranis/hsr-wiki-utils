{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You received a message from Asta, and she seems interested in the Foxian Beauty Chat in Xianzhou.<br />Asta wants to meet in the master control zone to talk face-to-face. What could it be that can't be said over a message?}}

===Talk to Wen Furui===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Researcher Wen Furui is so addicted to the Foxian Beauty Chat that he wants to be posted to Xianzhou. You accept Asta's request to investigate this fishy situation. Best to have a chat with Researcher Wen Furui first.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Bring Wen Furui's gift to Starskiff Haven===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|To get the private invitation link to the Foxian Beauty Chat, you promised Wen Furui to send his gift to Xianzhou, but the Foxian Beauty Chat never disclosed the recipient's address. Instead, you have to find the in-person operative. And so the plot thickens...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask the people around about the Foxian Beauty Chat===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Wen Furui sent an address where the in-person operative can be found. You are open and forthright, but now you have to meet with people like a spy. The passphrase is "Acquaintance from the mortal coil, luxurious gifts from beyond." Gather your courage and ask the people around you.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Talk to Qingque===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Although you haven't found the in-person operative yet, intuition tells you that Qingque's appearance here is not a coincidence. She must know about the Foxian Beauty Chat. It's best to just ask her directly.}}

===Find the courier cycrane and send the gift===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You have a gift for Ms. Daiqing, and Qingque has a secret logistics identifier code. At least Wen Furui's precious gift can finally be sent. Go find the nearest place where you can access Heron Express' express service.}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Talk to Asta again===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|At Asta's request, you spent a ridiculous amount of money and let the other side delete the contact information. You don't quite understand this way of spending pocket money, but Asta seems to have a plan. It's Asta's money anyway, so it's best to ask her what she thinks.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to the location agreed upon with Ms. Daiqing===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Ms. Daiqing stopped broadcasting, her manager ran away, and her fans were at a loss for the sudden change. Since you can't find the manager, go to the agreed-upon place with Qingque and meet Ms. Daiqing face to face.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Listen to what Qingque's game mates have to say===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Just when you are deciding what to do with Ms. Daiqing, Qingque's game mate, who is a genuine fan of Ms. Daiqing, wants to have a conversation with you right away. You don't know why he hides around the corner instead of joining the conversation. Go talk to the game mate.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Decide what to do with Ms. Daiqing===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The game mates hope you don't bring "Ms. Daiqing" to justice. After all, you're just an occasional passer-by who exposed a carefully hidden truth. Whether the truth should be revealed is up to you.}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Go to Cloudford and catch up with Qingque===

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The manipulation of the Foxian Beauty Chat doesn't seem too great, but you can guess from her slightly vague words that if things carry on like this, some fraud is bound to happen. It might be best to discuss this with Asta again.}}

===Start up and follow the courier cycrane===
