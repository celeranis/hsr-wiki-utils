::'''Sampo:''' What are some tips there for self-deprecation, you ask? I'm not a comedic actor, I wouldn't know. But I have seen some who disregard the comedy of their routines and only doing their utmost to let others hear their own laughter...
::'''Sampo:''' Heavens, that's so scary. Please don't become someone like that.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620603--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620701-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Speaking of chaos, have you ever seen a farce? It's different from a regular comedy &mdash; there's no rhythm to the script, no main or secondary roles. The actors are heavily made up, stepping on each other's toes, twisting around together, with each one thinking they're the center of the world...
::'''Sampo:''' ...Oof, that sounds eerily similar to real life, and that won't do.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' This business will succeed for sure! Come back often, fam!
