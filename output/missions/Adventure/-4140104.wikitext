:----
::This kind of iron fencing is seen all over Belobog. It is coated with a layer of white frost due to the low temperatures.
::It looks... extremely tempting, like a cake covered in sweet frosting.
::Your curious mind begins to wander: Is it sweet?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Lick it.
:::----
:::----
:::Sticking to your experimental spirit as a "Trailblazer," you stretch your tongue out toward the frozen railing...
:::The first taste is sweet. The middle part... hmm, it's still sweet, but a little tart, too. And at the end &mdash;
:::&mdash; There is no end, because your tongue and the railing have already formed an intimate bond, never to be separated.
:::Your tongue is stuck fast, and the fence remains immovable. Don't even think about fixing this situation with brute force, unless you've already set your heart on never speaking again. That is just asking for trouble.
:::You're trapped. Who could have ever thought that the brave Trailblazer that defeated countless Ice out of Space would be defeated by an icy fence... But, don't panic, there are lots of people around who know you from the Pillars of Creation project. Someone will come and save you in your time of need.
:::So, will you call for help?
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Hook, help me!
::::'''Hook:''' Hm? Wasn't that the honorary member's voice?
::::----
::::'''Hook:''' Ah, how did you end up like this, honorary member!?
::::'''Hook:''' Don't worry, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great will rescue you!
::::{{Black Screen|With the roar of the Diggertron, you managed to perfectly separate your tongue and the fence. If this had been anyone else, both may have been lost.}}
::::{{Black Screen|With the roar of the Diggertron, you managed to perfectly separate your tongue and the fence. If this had been anyone else, both may have been lost.}}
::::'''Hook:''' You're welcome! We Moles members must always help each other!
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't say thank you yet...
::::The freezing sensation on your tongue disappears, but is replaced with a burning sensation throughout your body. You think to yourself: "Kids really don't know how to hold back!"
::::If Natasha were here, you know she'd suggest you find a Space Anchor immediately.
