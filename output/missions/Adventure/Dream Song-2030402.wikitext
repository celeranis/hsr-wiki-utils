::The blue origami bird is as quiet as a doll, it refuses to speak again.
::Fischer asked me to pass you this photo.
::The bird's feathers ruffle slightly, but ultimately, it does not accept the photo.

::'''Dr. Blues:''' The Dreamweaver lost the last of his family, so he built a shelter at the bottom of Penacony and is hiding there.
::'''Dr. Blues:''' He hides at the bottom of the Dreamscape, yet his gaze is fixed upon the heavens above &mdash; he scorns Fischer's proclamations, yet he yearns for the day when Fischer's words come to fruition.
::'''Dr. Blues:''' A long time passed... His body was unable to withstand the test of time, so that compulsive liar of a Hound made a new body for him &mdash; a sky-blue origami bird that the Watchmaker painted as a portrait for the Dreamweaver.
::That is Dr. Blues...
::Formerly, Orla...
::'''Orla:''' However, the prolonged wait has taken its toll. His mind and memories can no longer endure the wait...
::'''Orla:''' Ah, Fischer is just a huge liar. He has never been back, and neither has anyone else. The Watchmaker and Gallagher both waited for their own "perfect ending."
::'''Orla:''' Look at Penacony now, bustling, beautiful, bright, exactly what Joey promised me.
::'''Orla:''' For those who don't agree with this beauty, I offer the Dreamflux Reef as their sanctuary &mdash; no one will ever feel deserted in dreams.
::'''Orla:''' The Origami Dreamweavers have fulfilled their promise, but... I cannot accept a Dreamscape without them.
