:'''March 7th:''' You're finally here. I've been waiting for ages! I started to think you might not make it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I'm late. I'll pay the bill...
::'''March 7th:''' We're not going out for dinner. There are no bills to pay today!
::March, I feel like you're putting a lot of pressure on me...
::'''March 7th:''' Really? Sorry. I brought some mung bean soda with me. Why not have a can to take the edge off?
::It's only right that the hero is last to board!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} March, I feel like you're putting a lot of pressure on me...
::'''March 7th:''' Really? Sorry. I brought some mung bean soda with me. Why not have a can to take the edge off?
::It's only right that the hero is last to board!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's only right that the hero is last to board!
:'''March 7th:''' Well, that's a convenient excuse for bad time-keeping!
:'''Yanqing:''' There is no rush. You're here just in time, (Trailblazer).
:'''Dan Heng:''' The crew have run to and from the Luofu many times, so there's no need to go to all the effort of a formal send-off, surely? March said you were late because you had something else &mdash;
:'''March 7th:''' Didn't you know? The Xianzhou Yaoqing and the Xianzhou Zhuming messengers are heading back home!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I hadn't heard that!
::'''Yanqing:''' Sorry, I didn't explain properly in my message.
::I had no idea that was today.
::'''Yanqing:''' ...That was why I hoped that the crew would be here.
::Can't they just stay on the Luofu forever?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I had no idea that was today.
::'''Yanqing:''' ...That was why I hoped that the crew would be here.
::Can't they just stay on the Luofu forever?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't they just stay on the Luofu forever?
:'''March 7th:''' The pink-haired fox, the crow-feather weirdo, and Master Yunli staying... That's still not bad, I suppose.
:'''March 7th:''' But the two generals cannot possibly stay on the Luofu forever!
:'''March 7th:''' That's why I suggested that we save the Crew's farewell until the very end! Let's go and see off our guests from afar on their way with Yanqing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You make it sound like we're the hosts here!
::'''March 7th:''' This is Dan Heng's home. Of course we count as hosts as well!
::'''March 7th:''' I studied swordsmanship here. Plus, think about how many friends you've made here... The Luofu is basically our home too.
::I want to... say goodbye, too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to... say goodbye, too.
:'''March 7th:''' Right! We knew you'd feel this way, so we went ahead and decided for you!
:'''Dan Heng:''' That's why March was scared. She thought you'd miss getting to say goodbye.
:'''March 7th:''' I knew you'd regret it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I get it now!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, March!
::'''March 7th:''' No worries!
:'''Yanqing:''' The Merlin's Claw and the Flaming Heart have already said their farewells to General Jing Yuan at the Seat of Divine Foresight. They wanted to travel light without the Cloud Knights' escort so as not to attract too much attention. I originally thought it may be a little rude to come to bid them farewell on my own, but...

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Though there were some bumps in the road, the Wardance has successfully concluded.<br />As March suggests going with Yanqing to bid guests from the other Xianzhou ships farewell, Yanqing expresses similar wishes. For now, why don't you await your soon-departing guests with Yanqing?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to March 7th)
:'''March 7th:''' I didn't have much time, so the only souvenir I managed to buy was the Luofu people's favorite drink.
:'''March 7th:''' If they're visitors from afar, then I imagine returning to their Xianzhou will take a long time. If they get thirsty, they can drink this and get a taste of authentic Luofu flavor...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not mung bean soda, is it?
::'''March 7th:''' That's right!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not Immortal's Delight, is it?
::'''March 7th:''' Do you not know the people of the Luofu by now? Of course it's mung bean soda!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm worried they'll be sick if they drink that on the journey...
::'''March 7th:''' Is it really that disgusting? This is a gift from the kindness of my heart!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The taste of the Luofu, a must-have anywhere.
::'''March 7th:''' Hehehe, I saw that advert, too!
:'''March 7th:''' We can't send our guests off empty-handed!

;(Talk to Dan Heng)
:'''Dan Heng:''' Miss Himeko and Mr. Yang have already begun their return from the Calenga Abyss as well, and they'll be arriving at the Luofu today.
:'''Dan Heng:''' If the timing is right, we should be able to meet them at the Starskiff Haven port.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's line up to welcome them!
::'''Dan Heng:''' I don't think we need all this fuss... Ah...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is a great opportunity!
::'''Dan Heng:''' I don't know if I'd call it that...
:'''Dan Heng:''' We still have some time before they arrive. Let's focus on sending off our Xianzhou guests for now.

;(Talk to Yanqing)
:'''Yanqing:''' Judging by the standard vessel transfer time, the Yaoqing guests should be arriving at any moment.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay, I'll wait here.
:{{DIcon|Exit}} Wait a moment. There's something I need to do.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It is a shame that we never got that duel.
::'''Huaiyan:''' Oh? You wish to see my skills?

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was just joking.

:::I am very curious about your true strength, General.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am very curious about your true strength, General.
::'''Huaiyan:''' Ah, please don't allow Feixiao to mislead you about me.
::'''Huaiyan:''' I am but an old man that has grown to love craftsmanship. My interest in competitions and fighting beasts faded long ago.
:'''Huaiyan:''' But I want to hear more from the youngsters! Yunli, did you not have lots prepared that you wanted to say before you left?
:'''Yunli:''' Ahem, as a master, I should pass on some words of advice to March before I leave.
:'''March 7th:''' Hehe, Master Yunli!
:'''Yunli:''' Come to think of it, you never took part in the Wardance in the end, did you?
:'''March 7th:''' Ah, well, no... I didn't.
:'''Yanqing:''' Weren't you and March both being treated in the Alchemy Commission at the time?
:'''Yunli:''' You think I don't know that? What I mean is, as she has not yet completed the initial target for her training, March has still not completed her tuition. I don't want you slacking on your training while I'm back on the Xianzhou Zhuming!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on her.
::'''Yunli:''' Good, no spoiling her like you normally do!
::Even if she had, she would still need to train.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even if she had, she would still need to train.
:'''Yunli:''' Quite right! Swordsmanship practice cannot be neglected!
:'''March 7th:''' Come to think of it, Master Yunli, weren't you originally after the reward that General Huaiyan was offering? Aren't you sad you weren't able to take part in the Wardance?
:'''Yunli:''' I'm not that sad! I heard Yanqing took victory as the ringmaster. So the sword still rests in worthy hands.
:'''Yunli:''' Plus, my grandfather has brought the prize all the way here. So does it not seem a little unceremonious for me to just win it and take it straight back? I will not steal Yanqing's thunder this time, as I don't want to embarrass him.
:'''Yanqing:''' Hmph, such gracious generosity, Yunli. You really helped me save face as the Luofu swordmaster.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Woah, Yanqing loves that sword more than his life, and yet...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gift-giving is quite an art...
:'''March 7th:''' Woah! Are you really thinking about giving your sword to Yunli, Master Yanqing?
:'''Yunli:''' Really? This sword is your proof of victory in the Wardance... Now I feel bad about taking your sword before.
:'''Huaiyan:''' What generosity! I knew I was right about you.
:'''Yanqing:''' You're such the humorist, Yunli. This was the sword I won as the ringmaster. I was just thinking that as you were leaving, you would not see it for a while. I brought it so you could touch it one last time and ease your regrets.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, Yanqing really does love that sword more than his life!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Communication is quite an art...
:'''March 7th:''' Let me translate for you, Master Yunli: "Nuh-uh, this is my sword, and you can't have it."

:{{tx}}
:'''Fu Xuan:''' I have been devoted to divining the cause and effect outcomes of so many things, yet I never divined that there would be so many people here to meet me on my return to the Xianzhou. I see the Xianzhou Luofu really just can't go on without me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Diviner Fu, we have been waiting a long time.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Hmm, thank you for the warm welcome. I have returned.
::Diviner Fu, what brings you back here?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Huh? So, you all standing here has... absolutely nothing to do with me?
::Who's this sassy, lost, short pink-haired girl?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Diviner Fu, what brings you back here?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Huh? So, you all standing here has... absolutely nothing to do with me?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who's this sassy, lost, short pink-haired girl?
:'''Fu Xuan:''' Huh? I cannot pretend I didn't hear that.
:'''Yanqing:''' ...Let me explain.
:Yanqing explained about seeing off the Xianzhou guests and the "reality" that they had no idea that Fu Xuan was returning.
:'''Fu Xuan:''' I understand what has happened. Although this was merely a coincidence, it is still a fact that you are all here now. How about you meet me halfway... "Meet me halfway" is a strange expression for this, but why don't we pretend you were awaiting my triumphant return?
:'''Fu Xuan:''' Actually, Yanqing, forget it. You have all been on the Luofu for all this time, and you didn't even notice that I wasn't here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I noticed, the Divination Commission has been so empty and lonely.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Very good. I see you truly care about the Luofu.
::If you were here, we would never have had so many issues!
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Precisely. There's no way so many things would go wrong with me around!
::I didn't notice at all. I thought you were still here...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you were here, we would never have had so many issues!
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Precisely. There's no way so many things would go wrong with me around!
::I didn't notice at all. I thought you were still here...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't notice at all. I thought you were still here...
:'''Fu Xuan:''' Did you hear that? It's a sound of something smashing to pieces... That was my heart thinking about working on the Xianzhou Luofu again.
:'''Fu Xuan:''' If I didn't have so many inquiries to deal with on the Xianzhou Yuque, then Jing Yuan would... Forget it, it's not important.
:'''March 7th:''' You must be tired, Master Diviner Fu. I have some mung bean soda. Please take one cup as a welcome back gift!
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What did you learn about the Yuque?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' I was mainly supporting General Yaoguang with providing details about the Ambrosial Arbor disaster and discerning the truth from the lies in Jingliu's confession... Honestly, I had no time to rest or learn anything new.
::{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Did you hear about Hoolay's escape from prison, Master Diviner?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' News about his escape has spread like wildfire. Of course, I am aware. Although, much like the citizens of the Xianzhou, I had nothing but joy when I learned that the entire matter was under the control of the Seat of Divine Foresight and the Ten-Lords Commission.
::{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should have told us you were coming back!
::'''Fu Xuan:''' I do not like fusses. This was simply a work trip, and there was no need for a welcome party.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' Although, I did contact Qingque in advance and tell her to come and meet me at Starskiff Haven... Hmph, I see she's nowhere to be seen. Looks like it's time to head back to the Divination Commission and see exactly what excuse she has this time.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Qingque, run!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You brought this on yourself, Qingque.
::'''March 7th:''' It's okay! Yanqing was planning to say their farewells to the Crew, so he could be your welcoming party, too! We have to take a group picture together first though!
