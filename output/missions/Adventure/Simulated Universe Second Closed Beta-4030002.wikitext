:::'''Herta:''' Yes?
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are the Aeons in there really simulations?
::::'''Herta:''' Ha, do you find THEM awe-inspiring, too? A virtual Aeon is not the same as any old AI. Ruan Mei and I came up with a way to connect virtual Aeons with THEIR real Paths.
::::'''Herta:''' Aeons in the Simulated Universe are the equivalent of a terminal, and THEIR divinity and wisdom come from the real Aeon. Otherwise, what would be the value in any information we get?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you decided on what to do with Aha?
::::'''Herta:''' I have a basic consensus with Screwllum. First, he'll try reducing the partiality values of the simulated Aha, even going as far as blocking THEIR Intra-Cognition &mdash; but that's a little dangerous and may attract the real Elation...
::::'''Herta:''' If we feel that method is unfeasible, then we'll probably leave this Aha to play however THEY like, while isolating THEM from communicating with the other simulated Aeons.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Who's this Stephen you keep going on about?
::::'''Herta:''' Oh, he's our fourth partner, member #84, Stephen "Weirdo" Lloyd. That guy's a genius with no interest in using his abilities, and spends two-thirds of his time in his adoptive father's fruit shop.
::::'''Herta:''' He can't even get himself excited about something as cool as the Simulated Universe. Stephen did us a favor and asked to remain anonymous &mdash; he doesn't want to make a big splash at all. Perhaps some geniuses wish they weren't one.
