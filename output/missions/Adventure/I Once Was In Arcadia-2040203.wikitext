::'''Furiae Archer:''' Hah. It sounds like no more than a story created by those that fear strife and death.

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location="Eternal Holy City" Okhema|update|Living in this unfamiliar city, the master of this memory is experiencing new feelings and changes within themself. There are many things here that she has never seen before, just like this banquet at the Marmoreal Palace... To the Kremnoans, Phagousa is nothing worth singing about. They may simply throw them a passing mention when they indulge in heavy drinking.<br />It seems that the dance of Strife cannot fully express its grace at a banquet of the ocean. When prejudice and fear rage like giant waves, no blade or shield can hold them back. The only assistance that you and Paris can offer is to prevent her little boat from being overturned so soon.<br />"It is shameful to accept a lover too quickly. One must take their time &mdash; as time is often the best test."}}

:The Furiae Archer sits alone, staring at Kephale in the distance. Their carved stone face shows no emotions at all.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' ...Can I help you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you okay?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Paris is looking for you.
:::'''Furiae Archer:''' Hah, he just doesn't give up.
:::Don't cry. Your enemies will laugh.
:::'''Furiae Archer:''' Why would I cry...? I'm not even capable of producing tears.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't cry. Your enemies will laugh.
:::'''Furiae Archer:''' Why would I cry...? I'm not even capable of producing tears.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' I am indeed thinking about what that captain said, but I am not sad. I am thinking about whether what he said is true.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' Humans are different to us. Kephale has bestowed you with infinite possibilities. Your bodies can be used for any kind of work, you can worship any Titan you choose, and you can do whatever it is you please.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' But we Titankin are not the same. My body is created for strife. I cannot taste food, dance with man, or create future generations. If it were not for Cerces' power overflowing into the world, I would not even have the right to thought or language.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' Perhaps I should return to the battlefield. That is the only way that I can truly know who I am... A warrior that does not even have a name. That is my fate.
::'''Paris:''' Girl, how is it that you are still speaking of fate? If the chains of fate were truly unbreakable, you would have long since been reduced to gravel in Castrum Kremnos.
::'''Furiae Archer:''' Paris...
::'''Paris:''' What is there to fear about fate? The Titan that bears the scales is themself confused. The Titan that pulls the curtain is blind, and the Titan that guides the way is lost. They are no more than three blind mice that guide the strings of fate!
::'''Furiae Archer:''' Hah. You cower on the battlefield, yet wield the courage to curse the gods of fate. I believe this courage of yours is misplaced.
::'''Paris:''' The gods would never pierce my heart with their blade personally, unlike the warriors of Castrum Kremnos. What's more, they cannot find it in themselves to assist their most devoted disciples. Do you think they have time to address a rambling mortal like me?
::'''Furiae Archer:''' ...This is true. To the Titans on their golden thrones, we are no more than insignificant ants.
::'''Paris:''' So, why not curse them with me? Come and vent your dissatisfaction with the arrogance of fate!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Janus' mechanisms are boring!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton's scale puzzle is boring!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The puppy Oronyx gave me wasn't cute enough!
:::'''Mem:''' How am I not cute enough... Wait, I'm not a dog!
::'''Paris:''' I'm not entirely sure what that means but... Our savior has led by example. It's your turn!

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location="Eternal Holy City" Okhema|update|Unbound, the spectators leap through time: Skipping past how it was that she suppressed the concerns in her heart, how she wore down the cold stares of those around her and how she won the acceptance of her former enemies. She has done so much to finally become a true subject of Okhema, as opposed to a guest or an enemy... But is this truly what she wants to do?<br />Is she not the same as you, being blindly led along by fate towards her mission?<br />Sometimes play interludes are used to represent the passage of time. Some playwrights criticize this approach, saying that time, location, and characters should be unified in order for spectators to resonate with the scene... But this is very difficult.}}

::'''Paris:''' Oh Mnestia, please grant me a romantic miracle!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's wrong?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you need my help again?
::'''Paris:''' Ah, my savior! It has been far too long! You always appear when I need you most. I cannot help but feel that fate is always watching out for me!
::'''Paris:''' I'm sure you are aware that Okhema is in grave danger. As the forces of Castrum Kremnos have made it to the city gate, now we have to mobilize the guards of the city garrison to battle.
::'''Paris:''' The enemy forces are attacking with the Revelation of Nikador. I fear any soldier that face them will meet a grim fate... But I don't want to die!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is your duty.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You are truly useless.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want to desert your duty again?
::'''Paris:''' My savior, it is not that I do not love this city that raised me. It's just that I have a dream that I have not yet completed... I have still not seen Arcadia. I don't want to enter the River of Souls without ever having laid eyes on it!
::'''Paris:''' So, let them say what they will about me. Traitor, deserter, coward... My duty, my responsibility, and my mission, I will happily abandon them all, but I must reach that place.
::'''Paris:''' I have already prepared my bags for my escape. But, before I go, there is someone that I hope would accompany me. You know who that is, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Titankin, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aren't you two moving a bit fast?
:::'''Paris:''' Hah, we have spent many days and nights together now. Anyone with sense can see how I feel for her.
:::Me? But wouldn't that be wrong?
:::'''Paris:''' Haha, my savior, this is not the time to be joking with me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Me? But wouldn't that be wrong?
:::'''Paris:''' Haha, my savior, this is not the time to be joking with me.
::'''Paris:''' I want to leave with her. Even if we die on our path, we can fly into the hands of Thanatos together on the wings of romance. We can become butterflies and fly to that place together.
::'''Paris:''' Savior, this love of mine has always relied on your assistance. In my heart, you are like an embodiment of Mnestia herself.
::'''Paris:''' Now, I will confess my love and wishes to her. Please bear witness and give me your blessings and strength... This is the last favor I will ask of you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have my blessings. Go for it!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing is more important than your happiness.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll be here with my popcorn.
::'''Paris:''' Thank you, savior. I will go now. I pray that you can bring me good fortune once more.

:'''Paris:''' Elder Oenone, I am sorry... I cannot take part in this judgment. I must go. Someone is waiting for me outside the city.
:'''Oenone:''' You... You are going to desert us? You are going to flee with that Titankin that is attacking our city as we speak?

:'''Paris:''' But...
:'''Oenone:''' If you side with her, you will forever bear her sins. You will become a villain, hated by the people of Okhema for eternity!
:'''Paris:''' But...
:'''Oenone:''' Further... Furthermore, the garrison guards will all place the death of Philoc on both of your heads! They may even bring you back to Okhema and see that you receive the most brutal of judgment!
:'''Paris:''' But... But if I don't have her, who else will help me escape my terrifying duties and responsibilities? Who will believe my stories and go in search of Arcadia with me?
:'''Oenone:''' ...Me.
:'''Oenone:''' Paris, my hero. I am here for you. Why would you give the golden thread to a vile, evil creature like that and not return it to its original owner?
:'''Oenone:''' With my influence, you can be spared from the battlefield and kept far away from the nightmares of strife. Let us escape to Dawncloud and spend our days in peace under the protection of Kephale.
:'''Oenone:''' Then, when the black tide falls and strife has been defeated, we can ride in our grand carriage as nobles and go in search of our city of romance...
:'''Paris:''' Arca... dia.
:'''Oenone:''' That's right, Arcadia. With the golden thread as my witness, it is a land known to the people of my hometown. I can help you find it...
