:'''Young Heartthrob:''' Hee-hee, look who's here! Boss, another blockhead has come to our territory.
:'''Young Sweetheart:''' Boss, {{MC|f=She|m=He}} doesn't know anything. {{MC|f=She|m=He}} is not welcome here at all. Hahahaha!
:You see a boy called Little Johnny and a girl called Little Susie. They are discussing their plan to conquer the world with Stonker, a cycrane. You happen to be their newest target.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Your boss is a cycrane?
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Our boss is smarter than grown-ups. Bossman here can help me with my homework even better than my mom.
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Exactly. Without bossman, we would still be back at home doing homework right now.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Since when did the Xianzhou become your territory?
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' You've got it wrong. The Xianzhou Luofu still belongs to Jing Yuan. We only own this small piece of land.
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Indeed. Do not take the liberty of expanding our territory. We won't be able to defend it all.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, I'll just leave then.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Stay right where you are! This is not a place where you can come and go as you please. Don't you know about the unspoken rules of the land?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, I know the rules. Guess that means we'll have to duke it out.
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' D&mdash;Duke it out?
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' If you dare to start a fight, I'll burst into tears first!
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Please simmer down. We don't go by the rules of gangsters here.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What rules? Please enlighten me.
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Wow! How cocky.
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Boss, this newcomer doesn't know a thing about our rules. Please explain the rules to {{MC|f=her|m=him}}.
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Alright, please pay attention to what I'm going to say.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll make myself scarce now. Please let me off the hook.
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Boss, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} is begging for mercy. I don't think we should give it to {{MC|f=her|m=him}}.
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' I agree, Boss. There is no better grown-up to bully than this one.
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Excellent points! All the more reason not to let {{MC|f=her|m=him}} go.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Listen, we're the Luofu Infamous Four. We despise fools who think violence can solve everything. In this cosmos, only wisdom counts!
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' And I am a cycrane who has been conferred wisdom, understand? Even{{Rubi| the Wisdomwalker|Nous}} will take notice of me! I'm different from ordinary humans like you...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just like Screwllum?
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Who's Screwllum? Have you heard of such a person?
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Could {{MC|f=she|m=he}} have made that odd name up just to fool us?
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' ...You two are so shallow. That's right! I'm just like Screwllum!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh really? What's your membership number in the Genius Society?
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' What number? I don't have a number.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Screwllum is actually a name I made up.
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Ahem, I just remembered &mdash; I really don't know any Screwllum.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There are quite a number of cycranes with the ability to speak.
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Boss, aren't you special? Please tell us you're special...
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Don't believe any of {{MC|f=her|m=his}} jibber-jabber... Have you seen any cycrane like them? I, for one, haven't. I'm the only cycrane in the whole cosmos whose intelligence exceeds that of humans.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, you're amazing!
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Hehe~
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Boss, is {{MC|f=she|m=he}} being sarcastic?
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Eh? Is that how you compliment others!?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's beside the point. About the Infamous Four...
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Are you talking about the Luofu Infamous Four? Fuporo isn't here today &mdash; he has the runs.
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' That's not the point! You should be impressed by my matchless wisdom.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' ...Stop talking about irrelevant details!
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Listen, if you want to leave our territory unscathed, you must prove that you have wisdom!
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Boss, there's a bonus question in our unfinished homework. How about we let {{MC|f=her|m=him}} have a try?
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Splendid idea! If {{MC|f=she|m=he}} can't solve it, it proves that {{MC|f=she|m=he}} is lacking in wisdom. If {{MC|f=she|m=he}} can solve it, it means we can just copy the answer.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Shh!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Tell me the bonus question.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Well, this is a challenging one. Even someone as intellectually endowed as myself can't make heads or tails of it, so it's the perfect question to test your intellect. Bring the workbook over here.
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Since you've accepted the challenge on your own accord...
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Don't blame us for picking on you.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' The question is...
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' There is a boy called Little Johnny, and a girl called Little Susie. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|They have each been tasked with planting flowers in ten pots.}}
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' I'm Little Johnny. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|It takes me five minutes and Little Susie ten minutes to till the soil for one pot.}}
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' I'm Little Susie. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|I can sow the seeds three times faster than Little Johnny.}}
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' I'm a capitalist, but I only have ten strales for them. How many strales should Little Susie get?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Please repeat the question.
:::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' There is a boy called Little Johnny, and a girl called Little Susie. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|They have each been tasked with planting flowers in ten pots.}}

::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got the answer.
:::'''Young Sweetheart:''' How much should I get?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 3 strales!
::::'''Young Sweetheart:''' That's not fair!
::::'''Young Heartthrob:''' How so?
::::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Both of us planted ten pots of flowers. Why should you get more?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got it! You should get 5 strales each!
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Let me think about it...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 5 strales!
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' 5 strales... I think that makes sense...
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Let me think it over...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 7 strales!
::::'''Young Heartthrob:''' That's not fair!
::::'''Young Sweetheart:''' How so?
::::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Both of us planted ten pots of flowers. Why should you get more?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got it! You should get 5 strales each!
::::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Let me think it over...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Both of you get nothing!
::::'''Young Sweetheart:''' From the capitalist's perspective, your answer might not be wrong.
::::'''Young Sweetheart:''' But this is just a homework question. I don't think it's supposed to be about the dark side of society...
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Return}} Hold on. Please allow me to think it through...
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Please repeat the question.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just here to make a scene on your turf.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' How dare you! Not only did you not ask for our permission to enter our territory, but now you want to make a scene. Don't you know about the unspoken rules of the land?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, I know the rules. Guess that means we'll have to duke it out.
:::'''Young Heartthrob:''' D&mdash;Duke it out?

----
:'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' I've got it. Since the workload is the same, each of you should receive 5 strales.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmph, it was just a simple brain teaser.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' S&mdash;Simple? I think so too...
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Boss, didn't you tell us to just skip the bonus question after thinking about it for a long time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was challenging, but we solved it together.
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' Don't be modest. You basically solved the question by yourself.
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' Boss just told us to skip the bonus question.
:'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now what?
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' There is no place for me here. I should leave now. It's not too late for me to return to Heron Express, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ziqiao sent me to get you back.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Really? Ziqiao needs me... There is no place for me here anymore. I should leave.
:'''Young Heartthrob:''' Boss, what are you talking about? You're still our boss, and this is still our territory.
:'''Young Sweetheart:''' He's right! We still need you to help us with our homework!
:'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' ...I thought I earned my position with my wisdom. I didn't realize your admiration for me was genuine.
:'''Young Sweetheart:''' It's all in your head.
:'''Young Heartthrob:''' Exactly. We don't need any reason to like you. Any boss who can help us with our homework is good in our books.
:'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' I'm afraid I must leave, but I'll still come back to visit every now and then. We'll always be the Luofu Infamous Four!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you recruiting new members?
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' Under normal circumstances, we could permit a fifth member to join the Infamous Four. But I won't allow anyone smarter than me in the group. I'm sorry to inform you that you can't join us.
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' If you can help me with my homework...
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' The answer would still be no!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you ever come back?
::'''Young Heartthrob:''' We still have work to do, and there's still plenty for the boss to do. Please don't interfere with our business.
::'''Young Sweetheart:''' That's right, we won't be letting boss leave unless we know for sure that they're going to come back.
::'''Cycrane with the Moniker "Stonker":''' I'm touched. I'll definitely be back.
:Seeing how happy they are, you wonder who the boss actually is here. In any case, it seems like the matter has been resolved, which is something to celebrate.
