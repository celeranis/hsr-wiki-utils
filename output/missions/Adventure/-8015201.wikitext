:What a sumptuous fight that was!
:Looks like this "fragmented record" really is a genuine lost martial arts manual. But these moves seem to be for a different purpose than you expected: Not useful in actual combat, but rather used to simulate actual combat training.
:What a fantastic treasure. Looks like we can use these moves to train our combat skills in the future. Scott really has put together something rare here.
