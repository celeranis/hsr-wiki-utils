===Head toward the Artisanship Commission and supervise Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040402-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|Chengjie decides to complete Master Ryan's design and hopes you can accompany him while he works. You don't know if supervision like this can yield any result, but go ahead and do it anyway.<br />When someone requires supervision before they have the confidence to complete a task, that says a lot about that supervisee.}}

;(Talk to Chengjie)
:'''Chengjie:''' I'm exhausted... I'm totally... drained...
:'''Chengjie:''' Hi, there. No matter who you are, please don't be bothered by my presence. I just want to lie down and be alone for a while.
:'''Chengjie:''' Oh... (Trailblazer), it's you. I'd appreciate it if you could talk some sense into me and help me pull myself together!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're... a hopeless good-for-nothing?
::'''Chengjie:''' Tsk... It does nothing to me. In fact, I even have an urge to laugh! Well, I think you should say something like this...
::'''Chengjie:''' I'm an idiot with no talent and a worthless bug who achieves nothing in his life. That thing on my neck is the most worthless thing in the universe. It's empty inside, without a single idea. It's worse than a black hole...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you can do it better than me.
:::'''Chengjie:''' Indeed, but when I'm the one who says it, I can't feel the impact of those words.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please don't insult idiots, bugs, and black holes by associating yourself with them.
:::'''Chengjie:''' I'm feeling it... There's a spark of anger rising deep down inside me. Hold on. Alas, that feeling's gone.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Humiliation can't keep you going for long...
::'''Chengjie:''' I know. There's only so much that self-motivation can do. I wonder how other craftsmen manage to stick with their jobs so persistently.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your master gave you his precious time...
::'''Chengjie:''' Isn't that what I've said before? Why am I not doing anything here when my master has given me his precious time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you ever thought of giving up?
::'''Chengjie:''' I have. It's been on my mind for the past 200 years.
::'''Chengjie:''' But as I said, Master Ryan gave me his precious time. If I give up now, that time will be wasted and cease to exist.
::'''Chengjie:''' I must become a craftsman of the Artisanship Commission to make everything worthwhile.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try it again. This is your master's dream.
::'''Chengjie:''' My master's dream...
::'''Chengjie:''' Yes, Master Ryan has given me his precious time. I must complete the starskiff to fulfill his dream. Otherwise, the time will be wasted and cease to exist.
::'''Chengjie:''' I have to complete it, to make everything worthwhile.
:'''Chengjie:''' (Trailblazer), thanks for coming here. I'll tell you when I complete the starskiff.
