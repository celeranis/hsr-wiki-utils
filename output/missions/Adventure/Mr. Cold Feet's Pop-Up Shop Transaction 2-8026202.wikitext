::'''Sampo:''' Mm, care to hear the story of the tavern still? I thought the friends of Trailblaze would've already visited it. Alas, Old Sampo's not all-knowing, and there are many stories that aren't convenient for me to share.
::'''Sampo:''' But I hear that the tavern will actively seek those out with stories. You look like a talent with a penchant for "elation." Perhaps you might receive an invitation one of these days? Haha.
:;(Return to previous option selection)

::'''Sampo:''' Take care, friend. Come back tomorrow!
