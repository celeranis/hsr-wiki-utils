:'''Fervent Follower:''' H&mdash;How could this happen? The all-mighty master seems so powerless against those giants, who are supposed to be weak despite their size...
:'''Uproarious Followers:''' This... doesn't make sense. The master is the Emanator of the Four-Foot Aeon and a capable leader of all diminutive races in the world.
:'''Boothill:''' ...Aeon? Leader? I guess you guys have been taken for a ride by this dude.
:'''Boothill:''' Heh, by the way, my offer just now still stands. I'll give you another 40 seconds to release the hostage and get out of my sight. Otherwise, I'll let you taste my bullets!
:'''Royroy the Master:''' Um... Th&mdash;This is just a small hurdle on our path to cultivation. Don't let these despicable thugs impede your enlightenment!
:'''Royroy the Master:''' I&mdash;I just need to raise the membership fee... That's right. As long as the Four-Foot Hall has sufficient funds, we'll surely be able to finish off these giants!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hear that? He's just after your money.
::'''Royroy the Master:''' Y&mdash;You shut up!
::Isn't your uncle loaded?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't your uncle loaded?
:'''Royroy the Master:''' Wh&mdash;Why did you mention Uncle Oti! Zip it!
:'''No-Longer-Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Is... Is that true, master? Is the Four-Foot Hall just your scheme to scam our money?
:'''Boothill:''' Still not moving? There isn't much time left for you!
:'''Fervent Follower:''' It's not worth it to risk my life here. Let me run while I still can!
:'''Uproarious Followers:''' What "Four-Foot Follower"? He's just a fake emanator... I want a refund for my membership!
:'''Royroy the Master:''' A bunch of weak-willed fake followers! Run all you want, you will never get a dime from me. Never!
:'''Royroy the Master:''' I knew that girl with Celestial Jade addiction was a bad omen... Even though you win this time, don't think you will have it easy again next time we cross paths! Keep that in mind!
:Royroy flees at lightning speed and disappears. You swear to your Nameless predecessors that he is definitely the fastest Pepeshi you have ever seen...
:'''Qingque:''' My friend! I knew you would come to my rescue!
:'''Qingque:''' I saw the whole thing when you guys were teaching that evil cult leader a lesson. The two helpers of yours are really something! I can tell they are pros just by looking at their attire.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Boothill and Argenti, this is Qingque.
::'''Argenti:''' It's my pleasure to meet you, Miss Qingque.
::'''Boothill:''' Huh, you from the Xianzhou, miss? Hello there!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Qingque, this is Boothill and Argenti.
:'''Qingque:''' Hi, everyone!
:'''Argenti:''' It's my pleasure to meet you, Miss Qingque.
:'''Boothill:''' Huh, you from the Xianzhou, miss? Hello there!
:'''Qingque:''' I owe you guys a big one! Looking back, I realize I was really foolish... That invitation message was so shady. Why didn't I notice it? I was totally blinded by greed.

::'''Boothill:''' Wait, so what (Trailblazer) means is... these Pepeshi are the thugs we're looking for?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've verified it &mdash; this is an evil organization.
