:::{{DIcon|Talk}} You have great martial skills for a merchant.
::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 115.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' The universe is a dangerous place. The IPC and the Alliance can only ensure that we travel in safety. Our personal security is dependent on our own capacities.
::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 116.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' That's how I trained my swordplay and healing skills. You are also a wanderer. Surely you understand.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What's in that coffin?
::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 117.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Ahh, that was some ill luck. I got involved in a conflict by accident and ended up owing a favor, so now I have to help send a deceased body back to Xianzhou.

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} How much do you know about the Luofu being sealed off?
::::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 108.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Almost nothing. I was scheduled to leave the Luofu when I heard there was a disturbance.
::::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 109.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Miss Sushang here is a member of the Cloud Knights. You can try asking her.
:::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Who is this Cloud Knight girl?
::::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 110.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Her name is Sushang. She apparently just transferred here from the Yaoqing.
::::::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 111.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Every Xianzhou ship operates individually, but the Cloud Knights are all commanded by the Marshal. Therefore, it's normal for Knights to transfer between ships.
