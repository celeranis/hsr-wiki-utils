;(Talk to Randolph)
:'''Randolph:''' (Trailblazer), you came! Do you want to help me photograph some "memoria" today? As before, send their location to me once you get a picture and leave the containment work to me.
:'''Randolph:''' I have to say, finishing my research in time for my deadline is no longer a crazy pipe dream now that I have you to help me! My stomach was starting to hurt from the stress!

;(Talk to Randolph)
:'''Randolph:''' My beloved assistant, (Trailblazer)! If you want to retake any pictures, you can come and find me any time.
:{{DIcon|Travel Log}} Let's begin today's shoot.
:<pre>{
	"$type": "RPG.GameCore.SetPerformanceResult",

:{{DIcon|Exit}} I've got something else to do.

:'''Randolph:''' Thank you so much, (Trailblazer). These pictures will make collecting and containing the memoria much easier.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is scattered memoria?
:'''Randolph:''' How should I explain this... I'm sure you must have tried SoulGlad before, right? It's Penacony's signature soda. I'll try and use that as a comparison.
:'''Randolph:''' No matter how tightly a soda bottle is sealed, some gas will leak out after the bottle has been lying around for too long. Similarly, human thoughts produce tiny amounts of "memoria," but they are so diluted that they are almost completely negligible.
:'''Randolph:''' Penaconian therapists have long preferred going deep into the Dreamscape to research concentrated memoria. However, I don't believe in this practice. The trash that people cast aside still has value &mdash; people just don't know how to make use of it.
:'''Randolph:''' I plan to begin by studying the scattered memoria of long-life species to broaden the study of psychological therapy. Perhaps there will come a day when I will be able to unveil the secret behind what the Xianzhou people call the "mara-struck."
:'''Randolph:''' Either way, (Trailblazer). If you have time in the future, remember to come back and see me again.
