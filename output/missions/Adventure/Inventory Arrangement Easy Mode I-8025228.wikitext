:'''Virtual Skott:''' Top dog (Trailblazer), here to play the goods stacking game? Come in, the game entrance is right inside, top dog.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Skott also gave you his image rights?
::'''Virtual Skott:''' That is correct, top dog.
::Did he even give you his image rights?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did he even give you his image rights?
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Of course he did!
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Skott is actually fairly easy to negotiate with &mdash; he'll do anything for the right price, top dog.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still prefer that curt demeanor of yours.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You end every sentence with "top dog"?
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Understood, top dog. You dislike my current conversational format. Allow me to restore myself then, top dog.
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Why're you here to stack goods again? What, didn't tire of running errands at Aurum Alley, itching for more sweaty labor at the temple fair?
:'''Virtual Skott:''' If you've got value to spare, why not let me squeeze the rest out of you. Don't waste your time on this trash game.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's my Skott!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Err... Perhaps a little too intense?
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Doesn't matter. I'm a virtual NPC in this Empathic Immersia. I'm still at your beck and call regardless of my attitude. This whole affair is so annoying!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Tell me a joke then.
::'''Virtual Skott:''' Tsk! Fine! I'm only gonna do one, and just one!
::'''Virtual Skott:''' One day, the teacher asked Blanca, Scarlett, and Vernon a question: "Bring the biggest thing in your house to school."
::'''Virtual Skott:''' The next day, Blanca brought her fridge to school, and boy it was a big one. Scarlett drove her dad's truck to school, and it was definitely bigger than Blanca's fridge.
::'''Virtual Skott:''' All eyes were on Vernon at this point. His hands were empty. So the teacher asked: "Vernon, what have you brought?"
::'''Virtual Skott:''' Vernon smiled, and said...
::Tell me a horror story then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Tell me a horror story then.
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Tsk! Fine! This story of mine'll scare the color off of your skin, so watch out!
:'''Virtual Skott:''' In the deep night, Scarlett and Vernon were going home together. When they walked into a deserted narrow alley, Vernon suddenly yelped in surprise, dragging Scarlett with him out of the alley.
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Pulling on Scarlett's hand, Vernon ran for a long time before stopping. His whole body was shivering, and he was at a loss for words.
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Terrified, Scarlett asked: "What happened back there?"
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Vernon pointed to that narrow alley they just ran past, and in a quivering tone, he said...
:'''Virtual Skott:''' Ah, we've exceeded 800 words! This chat will end now. Go stack your goods, goodbye.
