;(Talk to Abraham)
:'''Abraham:''' P&mdash;Please rest assured that this zone is now completely under the con&mdash;control of the Curio Collection Squad!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why is your voice shaking?
::'''Abraham:''' Shaking? It i&mdash;is not. You must've misheard.
::'''Abraham:''' Phew, phew... Calm down, Abraham. As a member of the Curio Collection Squad, you must always stay calm.
::'''Abraham:''' Fear, if picked up by others, will not only make everyone distrust you, but also ruin your chance to avenge Alfred.
::'''Abraham:''' Mrs. Hinkel transferred me here from the Obstacle Detection Terminal so that I could follow the lead of Wen Mingde, head of the Curio Collection Squad, to toughen myself up on the front line.
::'''Abraham:''' But as soon as I came here, I encountered a problem about, about...
::'''Abraham:''' Reactivating the Space Anchor over there!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's too hard.
:::'''Abraham:''' You think so too!? Great, I'm not alone.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even I can do it.
:::'''Abraham:''' Don't put it like that... You are the big hero who saved the space station. This's not something that anyone can do. You are being too modest...
::'''Abraham:''' Well, actually, the activation itself isn't the difficult part. You just need to get close to the Space Anchor, and the biological polarity of your body will be enough to activate it.
::'''Abraham:''' The real challenge is all the monsters along the way.
::'''Abraham:''' Back when I was working at the Obstacle Detection Terminal, they were nothing but distant shadows that I could just brush aside.
::'''Abraham:''' Then the invasion happened. And when I learned that they got Alfred, my heart began to fill up with hatred.
::'''Abraham:''' But when I became a member of the Curio Collection Squad and met them face to face, all I felt was fear!
::'''Abraham:''' At that moment, Alfred's fading eyes flashed in my head. I felt short of breath, with cold sweat all over my body and my legs trembling...
::'''Abraham:''' What a loser, right? I just couldn't find the courage to go through with it and activate the Space Anchor. And it had been like this for several days...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I remember you. You are that guy who is morbidly scared of death.
::'''Abraham:''' Remember me? I&mdash;I also remember you... But now I'm not a&mdash;afraid of death anymore...
::'''Abraham:''' The friends who had once stood by my side day and night have already taken the lead in entering the eternal night, and yet I'm still here, not knowing when my life will end.
::'''Abraham:''' Life is but a path to death, but not today.
::'''Abraham:''' I don't want to die at the hands of those monsters until I avenge Alfred!
::'''Abraham:''' Mrs. Hinkel transferred me here from the Obstacle Detection Terminal so that I could follow the lead of Wen Mingde, head of the Curio Collection Squad, to toughen myself up on the front line.
::'''Abraham:''' But as soon as I came here, I encountered a problem about, about...

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The solution is just a few steps away!
:::'''Abraham:''' It may look like a few steps, but I can't do it, even if I muster all my courage...

:::'''Abraham:''' So, (Trailblazer), do you think you can...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me!
::'''Abraham:''' I really admire you. Your perserverance and courage in the face of death have inspired me.
::'''Abraham:''' I'm well aware of my limitations, so I'll just wait here for an update from you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go together. We can look out for each other.
::'''Abraham:''' N&mdash;N&mdash;No, I can't. I'll just get in the way...
:'''Abraham:''' (Trailblazer), please {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|activate the Space Anchor}}. I am counting on you!

;(Talk to Abraham)
:'''Abraham:''' L&mdash;L&mdash;Left, The Hunt...
:'''Abraham:''' The Hunt on the left, Harmony on the right, and Erudition in the heart...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's done.
::'''Abraham:''' I can hear something... but no matter what happens, even if I die the next second, I must finish reciting this phrase.
::'''Abraham:''' The Hunt on the left, Harmony on the right, Erudition in the heart, and Preservation on the chest!
::'''Abraham:''' Okay, well done, Abraham.
::'''Abraham:''' Wow, you are back already? I only recited this morale chant 167 times, and the Space Anchor is already activated.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you doing?
::'''Abraham:''' Hey, you're back already! So soon! I've only recited this morale chant 167 times.
::'''Abraham:''' Before you say anything, please allow me to finish reciting it, otherwise, I will feel very uncomfortable.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I understand!
:::'''Abraham:''' Thank you, you're very kind.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, hurry up...
:::'''Abraham:''' Yes, I am going as fast as I can.
::'''Abraham:''' The Hunt on the left, Harmony on the right, Erudition in the heart, and Preservation on the chest!
::'''Abraham:''' Phew... Okay. Well done, Abraham.
::'''Abraham:''' Now, let's get back to business. I see that the Space Anchor over there has been reactivated.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The dragon on your chest!
::'''Abraham:''' On the chest is Preservation!
::'''Abraham:''' This is the chant of Aeon protection that I came up with myself. Please don't alter the wording, lest we offend the Aeons.
::'''Abraham:''' But I only recited this chant 167 times and you already activated the Space Anchor.
:'''Abraham:''' Actually, when I was reciting the chant, I figured it all out... Since you've helped me complete my task already, I can now continue to stay on the team. And I will eventually hunt down the monster that killed Alfred and avenge him.
:'''Abraham:''' I will prove to you that I have the courage to take that step before the long night of death.
:'''Abraham:''' I hope this is not our last encounter. Farewell, (Trailblazer)...
