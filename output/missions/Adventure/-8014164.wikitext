:'''Ruan Mei:''' "A new world slice." Ruan Mei's figure flutters and shines with a gentle sheen. "Shhh, (Trailblazer), don't tell Herta what we are up to here."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How can we help?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I will keep this a secret.
:'''Ruan Mei:''' "A reward." Ruan Mei blinks and gives a closed-mouth smile. "{{Color|keyword|nobold=1|You will always encounter my world slice}} here. Thank you for your contribution to my nurturing slice. This is simply a gift &mdash; A gift for our 'future'."
