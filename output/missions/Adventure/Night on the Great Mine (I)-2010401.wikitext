{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Elaine)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Any place worth visiting underground?
::'''Elaine:''' Worth visiting? Let me think...
::'''Elaine:''' The Goethe Grand Hotel probably. And then it's the Fight Club.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about the Goethe Grand Hotel.
:::'''Elaine:''' The Goethe Grand Hotel is right there. It's fancy, isn't it? After all, this is the Goethe family's first shop in the Underworld. It's the main store in Belobog!
:::'''Elaine:''' Gertie is the owner of the hotel and also my master. Not sure if you've met her...
:::'''Elaine:''' She's a great cook. You should try the food she makes.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Tell me about the Fight Club.
:::'''Elaine:''' The Fight Club... it's said that there are professional boxers fighting and monsters everyday... it's especially lively at night.
:::'''Elaine:''' But I don't like those. They scare me... I've never been there. I only heard this from other people. I'm sorry.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Return}} I see. Thank you.
:::'''Elaine:''' No worries! Although the Underworld is not as fancy as the Overworld, I hope you'll enjoy your time here!
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do you want to catch olms?
::'''Elaine:''' Hmm... because they are delicious?
::'''Elaine:''' It may sound funny but it's true. Olms are a common food in the Underworld. Many people would buy them for cooking.
::'''Elaine:''' Speaking of which, make sure you try the Iron Pot Braised Olm at the Goethe Grand Hotel.
::'''Elaine:''' I can assure you, that is the most delicious olm dish in the Underworld!
::'''Elaine:''' Ahhh... it makes me drool whenever I think of the crispy puff and the juicy olm meat. Master Gertie is such a wonderful cook...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you take any side jobs?
::'''Elaine:''' Well... I do. I will grab a net to catch olms after work...
::'''Elaine:''' However, I don't think I'm making any money. I usually can only catch two or three. When I try to sell them, I am told the price of olm has dropped...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you ever tried any other part-time job than catching olms?
::'''Elaine:''' Well... I did, actually quite a few.
::'''Elaine:''' But I only tried once or twice... In the end I realize the other jobs are more tiring than catching olms. Also, I'm not making much more money...
::'''Elaine:''' But catching olms is already not very profitable! I really don't get it... am I just unlucky? *sob*
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I shouldn't keep you. Best of luck.

;(Talk to Antonia)
:'''Antonia:''' Let's see... oh, yes, there is indeed something that could use your help.
:'''Antonia:''' An elderly mine cart operator intends to retire, but... he's not really hitting it off with his current apprentice. I guess you already know what I'm getting at. If the apprentice can't complete his training, then the master won't be able to retire in peace.
:'''Antonia:''' So, I'd like to ask you to be... um... assistant instructor for that not-so-bright apprentice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Assistant instructor?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uh, no. I know nothing of mining carts.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know just the man for this job. His name is Sampo...
::'''Antonia:''' Huh? No way. He'd bring nothing but trouble.
:'''Antonia:''' Relax. Though the title is "assistant instructor," it doesn't actually require much technical know-how.
:'''Antonia:''' That senior mine cart operator is very capable, but he has a bad temper and can be very stubborn. Things would be good if he had a gifted apprentice to begin with, but that's sadly not the case right now... So please find a way to help him.
:'''Antonia:''' What say you? Can you do me this favor?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a problem. Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I suppose I can give it a try...
:'''Antonia:''' They usually stay at the vagrant shelter in the mines. I've already told that senior mine cart operator about this. When you see him, just say my name, and he'll know.

;(Talk to Gertie)
:'''Gertie:''' Sure. I'm not too busy right now.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What dishes would you recommend?
::'''Gertie:''' Dishes? Check the food review book on the wardrobe and see what interests you. They are all my masterpieces!
::'''Gertie:''' ...Well, basically everything.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Wild Herb Soup?
:::'''Gertie:''' Yes, moss in the cave is the main ingredient. It is refreshing, sour and sweet, and especially good to open your appetite. Although it doesn't look too appealing, the taste is just fine according to our customers' feedback.
:::'''Gertie:''' However, the moss is really not easy to dig. This dish is not always available...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Iron Pot Braised Olm?
:::'''Gertie:''' Ah, not this one... look at the one below &mdash; this is the modified version! We specifically use an iron pot to braise olm meat. That way the meat becomes really tender... I learned it from a book, hahaha.
:::'''Gertie:''' People love this dish. It should be available very soon. I can cook some for you if you are hungry.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Candied mushrooms with pepper?
:::'''Gertie:''' Oh, it's a cold dish, as an appetizer.
:::'''Gertie:''' Can you eat spicy food? I use hammer pepper powder to enhance the flavor. Don't try this if you can't take spicy.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Rat Jelly?
:::'''Gertie:''' Well... I've renamed this Flavorful Jelly! This is a specialty of Boulder Town. Highly recommend!
:::'''Gertie:''' Don't get scared away by its original name... Hahaha.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Any other dishes...
:::'''Gertie:''' That's all for now... The rest of the dishes don't come out very nice. I'm still working on them. I'm so sorry.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you usually have a lot of guests?
::'''Gertie:''' Many people come here for our food. But not many people stay in our hotel...
::'''Gertie:''' After all, most of our guests are from Boulder Town. People would gather here after work to chill and chat with each other. It's pretty lively.
::'''Gertie:''' I'm the owner and also the chef of the hotel! Many people come here because of my cooking.
::'''Gertie:''' You outsiders are certainly very well-traveled. Let me know if you have any preferences for food, maybe I can also learn something from you!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Is this hotel under the administration of Wildfire?
::'''Gertie:''' Hahaha! What do you think Wildfire is?
::'''Gertie:''' Wildfire is just a peacekeeping organization started by people in the Underworld after the withdrawal of the Silvermane Guards. If there is a relationship between us... I would probably say they are our guests.
::'''Gertie:''' The people who join Wildfire are all kindhearted, good folk. Oleg wouldn't let any lazy good-for-nothings join. I have a nephew who works for Wildfire, he says they are really busy every day.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Can you tell me about the Goethe Hotel in Overworld?
::'''Gertie:''' Sure! Let me think where I should begin with...
::'''Gertie:''' I'll start with the Goethe family! After all, both hotels are our family business. It is said that our family was already here before the Eternal Freeze. We had a good relationship with Alisa Rand, the Supreme Guardian.
::'''Gertie:''' Our family used to be very influential. Have you heard of the Landau family? I guess we were similar to what they are today!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, a prestigious family!
:::'''Gertie:''' Hahaha, that's all in the past. It's not worth mentioning.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I do know the Landau family.
:::'''Gertie:''' Really? Now you know the Goethe family too. Congratulations! Hahaha.
::'''Gertie:''' After that, several scoundrels in the family lost all of our wealth. Fortunately, later on, someone revived our family business and they opened a hotel in the Underworld.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't know it had such a long history...
:::'''Gertie:''' True. Hundreds of years. My parents never told me the details. They just said this hotel was a legacy from my ancestors.
:::'''Gertie:''' As our hotel's business grew, some people wanted to expand the business to the Overworld.
:::'''Gertie:''' That Goethe must be very talented to be able to buy a shop in the busiest area of the Administrative District! That's how the Goethe Hotel in the Overworld was started.
:::'''Gertie:''' However, our family was divided ever since then, and now there are two separate branches in the Overworld and Underworld.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know Old Goethe from the Overworld?
:::'''Gertie:''' Of course! Although our family was divided, we do keep in touch. We hold family gatherings during festivals such as the Solwarm Festival.
:::'''Gertie:''' As for the Old Goethe you mentioned... According to seniority, we are actually the same generation, hahaha!
:::'''Gertie:''' But we haven't been able to get together since the Overworld and the Underworld were blocked. It's been many years...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then why is there another one in the Overworld?
:::'''Gertie:''' Be patient! I was about to talk about that.
:::'''Gertie:''' As our hotel's business grew, some people wanted to expand the business to the Overworld.
:::'''Gertie:''' That Goethe must be very talented to be able to buy a shop in the busiest area of the Administrative District! That's how the Goethe Hotel in the Overworld was started.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all.

;(Talk to Fidora)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you a mechanic?
:::'''Fidora:''' Of course. No one but a mechanic could make robots, could they?
:::'''Fidora:''' ...Well, actually, many people among the vagrants also possess that skill.
:::'''Fidora:''' But I'm different from them! They make robots for the Modified Robot Fight &mdash; the robots they make fight each other... I don't get the fun in it.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you need a language module for?
:::'''Fidora:''' It's... Why are you being so nosey?
:::'''Fidora:''' Okay, I'll tell you... I'm trying to build a robot that can interact with humans emotionally.
:::'''Fidora:''' Not the kind of machine that only follows a program or answers the question you ask &mdash; A robot that understands human language, and speaks and acts like a normal human being.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you want to build something like that?
::::'''Fidora:''' Why? Because it's my dream, of course!
::::'''Fidora:''' I want to create a robot with emotions... it's my ultimate goal as an amateur mechanic!
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you making an android?
::::'''Fidora:''' Android? What's that? It sounds weird... Right now, all I want to do is to equip the robot with a language module and do some additional optimization and improvement.
::::'''Fidora:''' In my opinion, mechanical structures are much more beautiful than the human body... I'm not stupid enough to try to make a robot look like a human. How boring would that be?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought you were making a humanoid mech that could be driven.
::::'''Fidora:''' I've thought about that... I heard that boys all dream of fighting in mechs.
::::'''Fidora:''' I get why they think that's cool. But for me, the most worthwhile research is to make robots that have human emotions...
::::'''Fidora:''' Anyway, that's all. Do you have any other questions?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Exit}} Um... Nothing.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you a mechanic?

;(Talk to Balaway the Miner's Lamp)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What are relics?
::'''Balaway:''' ...Are you sure you're not here to mess with me?
::'''Balaway:''' Fine, fine. I understand. You are an Outsider. It's normal that you don't know the history of Belobog.
::'''Balaway:''' Now that you've asked, let me explain to you. Do you know the "Eternal Freeze?"
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes.
:::'''Balaway:''' Good. You seem to know some of the history here.
:::'''Balaway:''' Although it's warm inside the wall all year round, there are constant snowstorms outside the wall. If you are really from the Outside, you must have seen it.
:::'''Balaway:''' This snowstorm isn't just temporary... Since seven hundred years ago, this heavy snow hasn't stopped for a minute.
:::'''Balaway:''' Before the snowstorm, Belobog's technology level was way much higher than it is now. Belobog residents call that "ancient times."
:::'''Balaway:''' As the name suggests, relics are antiques from before the Eternal Freeze.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know.
:::'''Balaway:''' ...Are you really from the Outside? You are not lying?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What have you appraised?
::'''Balaway:''' Ha! Too many! I can keep talking about it for two or three days.
::'''Balaway:''' But the most interesting thing is the torture device from the Old World.
::'''Balaway:''' Like... collar around the neck or anvil that automatically heats up? Tsk tsk, the life of criminals in the Old World must be hard.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is your appraisal process?
::'''Balaway:''' Well... First of all, people bring their relics to me, okay?
::'''Balaway:''' After it is handed over to me, I will start to evaluate it. After the appraisal, I will tell them the relevant functions and a price reference.
::'''Balaway:''' Basically, that's it. The last step is I'll charge according to the difficulty of appraisal.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm interested in your appraisal method.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you distinguish the difficulty of the appraisal?
::'''Balaway:''' It's a bit complicated. Most smaller items have relatively simple structures. You can find out its function structure by referring to respective documents.
::'''Balaway:''' The bigger items are the real trouble. Generally speaking, I have to disassemble them and check everything carefully.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Disassemble?
:::'''Balaway:''' Right. The function and value of relics can only be appraised accurately after they are disassembled.
:::'''Balaway:''' By the way, once the relics are disassembled, there is a risk that they can't be reassembled.
:::'''Balaway:''' And the risk... Naturally is to be borne by customers themselves.
:::'''Balaway:''' There is a lot of knowledge about relics, right? It must be eye-opening for laymen like you, haha!

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Refer to documents?

:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' All ready... Hey kid, come over here! Do you see what's in front of you?
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' I'm not going to explain how mine carts and tracks work. You grew up in the Underworld, so even if you've never seen them before, you've probably heard of them.
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Yeah.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' The thing you need to pay attention to is this &mdash; the track controller.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' The principle is very simple. Operate the controller like I just told you, and the disconnected tracks on the turnout will then be connected together.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' After that, the Geomarrow light on the connected track will light up. You can then use this to judge which direction the mine cart will go.
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm?
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Then comes this blocker. As the name implies, the blocker will block the route of the mine cart. If the mine cart is stopped by one of these, then the only thing we can do is send it back to where it just came from.
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm...
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' All we need to do is plan out the path and adjust the track direction through the controller to push the mining cart to its destination.

:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' That's it, I'm done. You just groaned and moaned and didn't say anything, so I'm not sure if you're getting all of this...
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' But, I have a way to test you. See, the test rig has been set up for you already. Show me how you'll go about operating it!
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Uh... I'm not sure about this.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' What do you mean by that?
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Well... it's way too hard.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' ...What did you say?
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Like I said, it's too hard. How should I go about it... I don't understand.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' ...
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' How many times have I taught you this already, huh? When we talk about the theory, you seem to be pretty onto it, but why's it always a cop-out when it comes to the real thing?
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Anyone with any shred of intelligence should have mastered this a long time ago! Operate the controller, change the track, move forward, operate the controller again, and then reverse. Where's the difficulty in that?
:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' ...I still can't figure it out, hehe.
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' ... Brat, you're trying to send me to an early grave, aren't you!?
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' You, come here! Show him how it's done. Anyone with half a brain can do it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm only an instructor assistant...
::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Enough nonsense. Isn't this why Antonia sent you here in the first place?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't get it either. Hehe.
::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Stop playing dumb. You were there when I was explaining everything. You should know just by watching!
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Then let's get started. If you want the mine carts to be reset, feel free to talk to me.

:'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' ... Oh, it's you. My master is still preparing his new puzzle, so I'm taking the chance to relax for a while...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still have some more questions...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What drove you to become a mine cart operator?
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? Why the sudden interest?
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Well, I guess, life happens. You see, my parents... they died a long time ago. My master, who was a friend of my father, adopted me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' The old man has been very good to me. I know he's worried that I wouldn't be able to make a good living in Belobog without the right skills. I guess that's why he decided to pass his skills to me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' But I just can't help being lazy... I mean, that's okay, right? I'm still young, so I still have plenty of time...
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' My master said that the mine cart operator is the lifeblood of the mine. The operator ensures the Geomarrow can be continuously transported out of the depths of the mine.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Geomarrow can only be delivered to the place it's supposed to go through the tracks we lay.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' I mean it sounds pretty important... But still I want to do something much bigger in life. I don't want to be trapped in these mines forever.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Forget it. I guess there's no point thinking so far ahead... I have to stay here for the time being to repay the debt of kindness I owe to my master. If I think like this, I feel more at ease.

:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You mean the kid... Well, that's a long story. He's had a pretty tough life so far.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' His father was working with me in the mines before. But he decided to try his luck scavenging in the Fragmentum with a group of vagrants... He never came back.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' I saw he had no one to rely on, so I thought to pass on my track-laying skills to him. With those skills, he can make a living for himself.

::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' That's right! I've been with this mining team for many years. I can't remember exactly how long, but this mine has been operating for nearly twenty years now.

:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Forget it. I guess there's no point thinking so far ahead... I have to stay here for the time being to repay the debt of kindness I owe to my master. If I think like this, I feel more at ease.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What drove you to become a mine cart operator?
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? Why the sudden interest?
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Well, I guess, life happens. You see, my parents... they died a long time ago. My master, who was a friend of my father, adopted me.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' The old man has been very good to me. I know he's worried that I wouldn't be able to make a good living in Belobog without the right skills. I guess that's why he decided to pass his skills to me.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' But I just can't help being lazy... I mean, that's okay, right? I'm still young, so I still have plenty of time...

;(Talk to Senior Mine Cart Operator)
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You're early. I'm still working on a new puzzle, so you'll have to come back later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still have some more questions...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How did you meet your current apprentice?
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You mean the kid... Well, that's a long story. He's had a pretty tough life so far.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' His father was working with me in the mines before. But he decided to try his luck scavenging in the Fragmentum with a group of vagrants... He never came back.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' I saw he had no one to rely on, so I thought to pass on my track-laying skills to him. With those skills, he can make a living for himself.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' That's right! I've been with this mining team for many years. I can't remember exactly how long, but this mine has been operating for nearly twenty years now.
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Do you see that big vein in the middle of the mine? Absolutely stunning! Why didn't those useless surveyors find it earlier! To think that the most valuable prize was hiding in plain sight...
