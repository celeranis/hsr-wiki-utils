Naturally, the burden of demonstrating the correct way to operate mine carts for his apprentice has been relegated to you, the "Ace Assistant."<br />Before getting started, you should check in with the senior mine cart operator and see how his preparation is going.}}

;(Talk to Senior Mine Cart Operator)
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You're early. I'm still working on a new puzzle, so you'll have to come back later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still have some more questions...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How did you meet your current apprentice?
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You mean the kid... Well, that's a long story. He's had a pretty tough life so far.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' His father was working with me in the mines before. But he decided to try his luck scavenging in the Fragmentum with a group of vagrants... He never came back.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' I saw he had no one to rely on, so I thought to pass on my track-laying skills to him. With those skills, he can make a living for himself.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' That's right! I've been with this mining team for many years. I can't remember exactly how long, but this mine has been operating for nearly twenty years now.
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Do you see that big vein in the middle of the mine? Absolutely stunning! Why didn't those useless surveyors find it earlier! To think that the most valuable prize was hiding in plain sight...

:::{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all the questions I have.
