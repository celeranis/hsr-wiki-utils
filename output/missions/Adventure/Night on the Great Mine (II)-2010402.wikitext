{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Great Mine|After a series of challenges, you seem to have finally gotten the knack for being a mine cart operator's assistant.<br />The Senior Miner says that he's also prepared a series of questions to test his apprentice. Naturally, the burden of demonstrating the correct way to operate mine carts for his apprentice has been relegated to you, the "Ace Assistant."<br />Before getting started, you should check in with the senior mine cart operator and see how his preparation is going.}}

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still have some more questions...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What drove you to become a mine cart operator?
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? Why the sudden interest?
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Well, I guess, life happens. You see, my parents... they died a long time ago. My master, who was a friend of my father, adopted me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' The old man has been very good to me. I know he's worried that I wouldn't be able to make a good living in Belobog without the right skills. I guess that's why he decided to pass his skills to me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' But I just can't help being lazy... I mean, that's okay, right? I'm still young, so I still have plenty of time...
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' My master said that the mine cart operator is the lifeblood of the mine. The operator ensures the Geomarrow can be continuously transported out of the depths of the mine.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Geomarrow can only be delivered to the place it's supposed to go through the tracks we lay.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' I mean it sounds pretty important... But still I want to do something much bigger in life. I don't want to be trapped in these mines forever.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Forget it. I guess there's no point thinking so far ahead... I have to stay here for the time being to repay the debt of kindness I owe to my master. If I think like this, I feel more at ease.

:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Well, I guess, life happens. You see, my parents... they died a long time ago. My master, who was a friend of my father, adopted me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' The old man has been very good to me. I know he's worried that I wouldn't be able to make a good living in Belobog without the right skills. I guess that's why he decided to pass his skills to me.
:::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' But I just can't help being lazy... I mean, that's okay, right? I'm still young, so I still have plenty of time...
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' My master said that the mine cart operator is the lifeblood of the mine. The operator ensures the Geomarrow can be continuously transported out of the depths of the mine.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Geomarrow can only be delivered to the place it's supposed to go through the tracks we lay.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' I mean it sounds pretty important... But still I want to do something much bigger in life. I don't want to be trapped in these mines forever.
::::'''Apprentice Mine Cart Operator:''' Forget it. I guess there's no point thinking so far ahead... I have to stay here for the time being to repay the debt of kindness I owe to my master. If I think like this, I feel more at ease.

;(Talk to Senior Mine Cart Operator)
:'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You're early. I'm still working on a new puzzle, so you'll have to come back later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I still have some more questions...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} How did you meet your current apprentice?
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Hmm? You mean the kid... Well, that's a long story. He's had a pretty tough life so far.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' His father was working with me in the mines before. But he decided to try his luck scavenging in the Fragmentum with a group of vagrants... He never came back.
:::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' I saw he had no one to rely on, so I thought to pass on my track-laying skills to him. With those skills, he can make a living for himself.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you been working in these mines for a long time?
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' That's right! I've been with this mining team for many years. I can't remember exactly how long, but this mine has been operating for nearly twenty years now.
::::'''Senior Mine Cart Operator:''' Do you see that big vein in the middle of the mine? Absolutely stunning! Why didn't those useless surveyors find it earlier! To think that the most valuable prize was hiding in plain sight...
