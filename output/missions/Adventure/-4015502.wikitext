:'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' I feel like my inner bird is about to take flight and sing anytime!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There is indeed a bird on the dial.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your mind's not playing tricks on you.
:'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' I feel my gears transforming... Something is starting to sprout on the dial... I can't wait to see the world!
:'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' ...Perhaps your kindness is what set all this in motion. It's time for my journey to start. Stay well!
