:The child who disappeared into the bustling market earlier on suddenly appears before you again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where have you been?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Here comes the loot ninja.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your SPD is pretty maxed out.
:'''Urania:''' Sorry, {{MC|f=big sis|m=big bro}}, please hear me out...
:'''Urania:''' The gods' eyes are ever lonely. Our years in the flux of time are but a speck of dust, floating about in Oronyx's billows.
:'''Urania:''' We were blown to a mortal's grave yesterday, and drift to a godly palace today. We see justice, hysteria, glory, betrayal, madness... but we have no right to judge.
:'''Urania:''' Because eyes have no stance nor purpose, only the duty of observance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What eyes? What duty?
::'''Urania:''' "...The Eye of Twilight is all-seeing, its vision as far-reaching as the sky dome..."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm mad bright. How can I be dust?
::'''Urania:''' ...True.
::So some weird kid is dishing out riddles now?
::'''Urania:''' Ah, they're just warnings from elders at home.
::'''Urania:''' "...The Eye of Twilight is all-seeing, its vision as far-reaching as the sky dome..."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So some weird kid is dishing out riddles now?
::'''Urania:''' Ah, they're just warnings from elders at home.
::'''Urania:''' "...The Eye of Twilight is all-seeing, its vision as far-reaching as the sky dome..."
:'''Urania:''' My clan is the eye of Aquila in the mortal realm. Even though they have closed their hundred eyes, we still persist in our duties.
:'''Urania:''' I wanted to impart this sacred duty to {{MC|f=big sis|m=big bro}}, but it looks like I've picked the wrong person &mdash; you are not a silent "spectator."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Obviously not. I'm the main character.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course not. I'm not mute.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A narrative without interaction is so pass√©!
:'''Urania:''' Heh heh, if we do meet again, I hope you will let {{Rubi|my master|Eye of Twilight}} see even greater things.
