:{{DIcon|?}} Bodybuilder SoulGlad
:'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Ah! {{MC|f=Madam|m=Sir}}, please allow me to get a good look at your brilliance! Your body is more dazzling than a supernova! Not even an ascetic who has traveled many stars could aspire to match your virtue!
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' One look at you and it feels like two million years of rain has fallen on my heart, and what was once bitterly cold and frozen has thawed to form a vibrant rainforest!
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Meeting you here, I am certain that the Great One Xipe is taking pity on me for my tough times.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you want?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Get to the point or put a cap on it.
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Such a direct and outspoken hero! Then I shall make a long story short... Have you heard of the SoulGlad Auditions?
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' The SoulGlad Auditions are to the soda world what the Festivity Auditions are to you.
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' The most outstanding SoulGlads in all of Penacony are gathered together and engage in a vicious battle to find the SoulGlad Superstar.
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I was a shoo-in for first place this year, but one of my arch-competitors spent a fortune and hired a crate of fine rose wine bottles that seduced me into popping my cap, and pouring all of my contents into the embrace of sweetness...
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' When I realized what had happened, my biggest competitive edge &mdash; my powerful bursting bubbles &mdash; were all gone!
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' {{MC|f=Kind lady|m=Kind sir}}, the competition is imminent, can you really bear to see a SoulGlad with such lofty aspirations fall flat like this?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to buy you a pressurizer?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to buy you a gas pump?
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' There's no time for such things now. A bottle of SoulGlad that has lost its fizz is nothing more than a bottle of gross syrup. But, I have a more traditional solution.
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I want you to insult me, the harsher the better!
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' When my anger reaches its peak, the pressure will build up and a huge amount of air will come bursting forth from my bottle. With this rage, I'll obtain infinite bubbles and snatch the audition crown!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a pretty unique request.
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Bring it on. Insult me to my face!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That doesn't sound like a good idea...
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' This is for my future. I have no problem!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then I won't hold back!
::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Hold on, let me groom myself a little... As the future SoulGlad Superstar, I must learn to face even insults with a sense of ceremony.
::The SoulGlad bottle wriggles about grotesquely a few times, but you can't see a difference at all.
::Perhaps this method of "looking like it's doing something but actually did nothing" is also part of the ceremony?
::It puffs out its chest proudly. Its remaining few bubbles stir with a gurgle to indicate that it is ready for your insults.
:'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' {{MC|f=Madam|m=Sir}}, I am prepared. Let us make this a swift battle!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Get ready for a taste of hell!

:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I... I fear nothing!
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Don't go getting all soft on me. Give me your worst! Whether I can enter the collection display cabinet and become the SoulGlad Superstar is counting on that mouth of yours!
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' As you know, us SoulGlads' emotions are quite easily stimulated. So, no matter what happens to me, you must not stop! I know how mad I have to be to take victory!
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Come, let me feel your baptism of bullets!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You little...
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Wait, wait, wait, wait. Slow down. Let me take a deep breath... And another one... May Mr. Sousa bless me, may Boss Aideen bless me.
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Alright, let's start again.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You think cheap trash like you is worth my insults?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I thought we had an agreement? Are you saying you're going to go back on your word after all this? You wretched, shameless human!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' They say the hearts of humans are like water... But I'd say that's an insult to water! You see these bubbles? They represent my rage and contempt for you!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Wait, these bubbles... So that was your plan all along? I get it!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you still be used to clean a toilet?
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' If you've got no fizz left in you, that is.
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' How many times have I said this? SoulGlad being used to wash toilets is a racist stereotype! It's defamation of our name!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' What can't be used to clean a toilet? Why not use an anti-matter grenade? That'll get it so clean there won't even be a toilet left!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Darn it, look at these fresh bubbles. That may not have been very original, but it was effective.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What flavor do you like the most?

::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Me? Ice SoulGlad, obviously. The danger of staying in that state just before you freeze completely is perfect!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' That flavor, just thinking about it makes me... No, wait. You're supposed to insult me! Insult me!
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I'm not even one ten-thousandth of my full fizz right now. Try again!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The SoulGlad company is heartless.
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' If I say insult me, then insult me! Bringing my manufacturer into this is going too far. What did SoulGlad even do to you?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' The SoulGlad enterprise is one of the top public benefactors in Penacony! Their products have maintained excellent quality with low prices for millennia, and you say they are heartless!?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' ...Woah! That's got my bubbles going! My bottle cap is ready to burst! Alright, you know how to insult someone!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You'll never get into Paperfold University by drinking SoulGlad!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Why are you blaming SoulGlad for everything? What does not getting into university have to do with a drink anyway?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Those supplements and health tonics get sold for tens of thousands of credits elsewhere in the universe, but you can walk off with a bottle of SoulGlad for just a few Alfalfa credits! What is there to gripe about?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I don't even want to keep talking to you anymore in case my cap bursts off with rage and hits you in the face... Insult me more!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I like your haircut.

::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Of course, this is the most fashionable bottle cap style in all of the SoulGlad world.
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' No... {{MC|f=Lady|m=Bro}}, I said insult me, not compliment me!
:::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I've still got nowhere near enough bubbles in me! Hit me with another insult, quickly!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I like cumin-flavored SoulGlad.
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' What the BUBBLE!? What kind of cursed drink is that? How could the universe allow such a blasphemous SoulGlad to exist?
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' I'm going to report this to the Intelligentsia Guild. I cannot believe that some mad scientist would defy the ethics of SoulGlad like this!
::::'''Bodybuilder SoulGlad:''' Look at all these bubbles. I'm about to explode! I admit that this story you made up has angered me... You did make it up, right?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I can't do it.
