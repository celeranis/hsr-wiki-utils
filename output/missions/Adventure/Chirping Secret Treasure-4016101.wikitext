:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that the corpse of a bug talking?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me help you understand with my bat.
:'''Joyworm:''' Uh, sorry, sorry. It's all my fault &mdash; this loud mouth of mine. It's been so long since I've talked to a real person, I barely remember how to speak... Hehe. Since you're alive, I shouldn't stop you &mdash; there's treasure up there, go take a look!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That I do.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if I don't?
::'''Joyworm:''' *whoosh* We're doomed. I can't teach you. Goodbye, it was nice meeting you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just kidding, I actually know how to use it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's fine, I just figured it out.
:'''Joyworm:''' You almost got me... Anyway, using the prayer isn't such a big deal. Listen carefully, as long as you make {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|all the balls stop on the pressure plates}}, it's done!

:'''Joyworm:''' By the way, have you tried using the ball to hit monsters? It's so fun! Just like when you first arrived... Oops, I didn't say anything.
:'''Joyworm:''' I even named each move! The left spin is "Flash Strike," the right spin is "Earth-Shattering," and the straight shot is just "Straight Shot."

::'''Joyworm:''' Stage mechanism? I don't know what you're talking about, but if you say so, then sure.
:'''Joyworm:''' I remember the old priest saying that the puzzles would keep expanding over time... Looks like this is what he meant. The priest of {{Rubi|Oronyx|Time Titan}} &mdash; impressive, isn't it?
:'''Joyworm:''' No time to waste. Let's begin! Be sure to remember the position of the balls!
