;(Talk to "Spirithief" Bartholos)
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Stop for a moment... I have to tell you something about you. In all of my years of thievery, I have never met someone like you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The same exact introduction, huh?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hmm? What do you mean? Have we met somewhere before?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Or am I losing my memory like Oronyx?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Ah &mdash; I see! You must have seen a show about my magnificent career! Well, that's natural &mdash; I do have many admirers. But anyway...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Remain silent)
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' No precious gems or ancient relics in here. Looks heavy and important, but really? Just like these dusty books &mdash; the world wouldn't skip a beat without them.
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' But you're still gonna haul it away? What's your deal &mdash; wallet so thin you're scraping for pennies, or mind so empty you need worthless junk to fill it?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems like this chest is actually QUITE valuable.
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' ...Hm? Caught on, have you?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Y&mdash;you bet! This box means more to me than you could imagine! Still going to fight me on this?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cos your reactions amuse me.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Oh! I get it now &mdash; this is all a game to you!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Now this is getting interesting...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is grown-up stuff, kid. Run along.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hey, watch that attitude! The universe was young when I came into being a mud puddle &mdash; long before your great-great-grandparents were even a twinkle in the Cosmos!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Although... perhaps that spark of yours makes you worth keeping around.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Smile silently)
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' ...
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hmph, think you're better than me?
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Then I'll have to surprise you...
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Alright, I, Bartholos, have decided! You can have this &mdash; but don't celebrate too soon. Take this cursed gift, and you'll have the world's most annoying thief master on your tail from now on!
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehehe, you'll see... Like all these books here, everything turns to ash eventually.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Every sacrifice, even the briefest moment of life, carries meaning.
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Tch... you sound just like the priests here. Or are you one of those &mdash; what do they call it &mdash; performance artists?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cos your reactions amuse me.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Oh! I get it now &mdash; this is all a game to you!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Now this is getting interesting...

::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Yeesh... that smile of yours is rather disturbing.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cos your reactions amuse me.
