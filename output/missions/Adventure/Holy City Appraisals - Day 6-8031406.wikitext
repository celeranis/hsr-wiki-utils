::'''Theodoros:''' The last Chrysos Heir dolium just got snatched up, dear customer. If that's what you came for, I'm sorry for the disappointment!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is a "Chrysos Heir dolium"?
:::'''Theodoros:''' Haha, it looks like I misread your interest. Lately, it seems like everyone who stops by is on the hunt for that specific line of products.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does such a business exist?
:::'''Theodoros:''' Haha, it looks like I misread your interest. Lately, it seems like everyone who stops by is on the hunt for that specific line of products.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I placed an order for a dolium ten years ago! And it still hasn't arrived!
:::'''Theodoros:''' My apologies once again! Even though my shop has been around for a decade, most recent visitors have been on the lookout for my Chrysos Heir Dolia, and I've never managed to keep enough in stock.
::'''Theodoros:''' As for their origin, one day, while spotting Lord Phainon patrolling the city, I felt inspired and painted the epic tales of Okhema's Chrysos Heirs on a dolium.
::'''Theodoros:''' Their courage and elegance must come from the fluttering wings of Mnestia, the Chrysalis of Gold! Their magical powder must have imbued them with such perfection!
::'''Theodoros:''' Naturally, my dolia carry this same honor. Now, fans of the Chrysos Heirs flock to my humble shop on sale days.
::'''Theodoros:''' Honestly, it's all a bit surreal to me. Not too long ago, I was still a struggling artist lost in my thoughts, setting up a booth on the plaza across the street, painting on dolia here and there to make ends meet.
::'''Theodoros:''' After the frenzy over these Chrysos Heir Dolia, I opened this shop and gained some recognition. Tomorrow, I'm off to the Marmoreal Palace to paint a portrait for a distinguished elder's grand birthday bash!
::'''Theodoros:''' However... something feels off...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I get where that comes from!
:::'''Theodoros:''' It's remarkable to see someone as young as a new crescent moon with such profound insights into life.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't it amazing to achieve both fame and fortune?
:::'''Theodoros:''' Well, I'm nothing special.
::'''Theodoros:''' ...Let's just bask in the bright light of the {{Rubi|Lucid Hour|Third of the Five Moments}} and forget the days of sorrow.
::'''Theodoros:''' Apart from the Dolia, I also offer a range of ancient artifacts I've gathered from all over. If anything piques your interest, just let me know.

:'''Theodoros:''' Ha, this scam artist is truly a joke.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's the story of this treasure?
::'''Theodoros:''' Artifacts deeply integrated into daily life often have origins obscured by the passage of time.
::'''Theodoros:''' Some claim the bottle's neck resembles a Kremnos Guardian's helmet, hinting at its origins in Castrum Kremnos, with the red shade at its edge a trace of Nikador's blood.
::'''Theodoros:''' I'm skeptical of that tale. Kremnoans, with their advanced metalworking, would more likely favor metal vessels.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} See you tomorrow.
::'''Theodoros:''' And yes, come for more training tomorrow.
