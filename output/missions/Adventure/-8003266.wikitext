;(Talk to Tall Auntie)
:'''Tall Auntie:''' I'm working my tail off while that slumber-bot of a cycrane is slacking off...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
:'''Tall Auntie:''' Oh, it's you, (Trailblazer)! You came at just the right time. I've got myself tied up in knots over what to do about this unruly cycrane.
:'''Tall Auntie:''' Here's the deal: I've received some take-away orders, but the cycrane that is supposed to deliver them just keeps slacking off instead.
:'''Tall Auntie:''' I've been on a wild goose... err, cycrane chase trying to catch it, but it's way too quick for me.
:'''Tall Auntie:''' At this point I know that bird's habits like the back of my hand &mdash; it's probably {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|napping on a pile of boxes down at the dock}} this very moment.
:'''Tall Auntie:''' Speaking of which... it's gone missing again today. I'm pretty sure it's taking a nap {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|down at the dock}}, but I'm too busy to go looking for it myself. Could you track it down and give it a little nudge?
