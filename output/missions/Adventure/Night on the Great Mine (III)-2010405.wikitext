{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Great Mine|You have become a superstar in the Underworld and have caught the attention of thousands of miners. Throughout Belobog's history, no one else has mastered the art of directing mine carts as quickly as you... Even though you were only supposed to be an assistant instructor.<br />What is a mine cart? Where does it come from? Where should it go? These are the holy trinity of questions that haunt all miners. You are only one step away from uncovering the answer.<br />The answer to this question is embedded deep into the final test that the senior mine cart operator has prepared for you. Let's see what he has in store for you.}}
