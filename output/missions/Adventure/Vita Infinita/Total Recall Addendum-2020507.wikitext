;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 251.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey, the "me" in the Light Cone looks kinda cute, don't you think?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Sure.
:::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 252.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hee-hee, just telling it like I see it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cuter than the real you.
:::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 253.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmph, don't believe you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not as cute as the real you.
:::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 254.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Obviously! How could "Light Cone me" be cuter than actual me?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 244.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh, I just found this in my pocket... How did it get there?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it?
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 245.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Looks like a Light Cone. Didn't that weird voice in the Matrix say something about a parting gift? I guess this is it.
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 246.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' My "origin," huh... I don't know why, but the voice sounded friendly to me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I trust your intuition.
:::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 247.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Well, guess I'll keep it then!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know about that...
:::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 248.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* You're too cautious. A gift is a gift &mdash; it's rude not to take it!
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 249.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Jumping through all those hoops in the Matrix was pretty exhausting, but this little gift makes me feel like it was worth it.
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 250.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'll have to find time to thank Miss Fu Xuan properly. I really owe her one.
