:'''Pela:''' Let's start searching for Miss Molly's things from here. We don't need to go up the stairs. That place is not part of the old city fortress and has nothing but ancient battlefields.
:'''Pela:''' Thankfully, we didn't encounter any enemies coming here, but I can't promise it'll stay that way on our way back. Keep your eyes peeled. This place gives off a strange vibe today.
:{{DIcon}} You seem familiar with this place?
::'''Pela:''' Yeah. I used to come here with Gepard to survey the terrain &mdash; but that was a long time ago.
::'''Pela:''' Needless to say, it was very important for an intelligence officer to personally map the battlefield. Unfortunately, the pressure on the front line increased so quickly that we had to retreat to the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone... And those pieces of intelligence were not very useful in the end.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon}} What's so strange about this place's vibe?
::'''Pela:''' It's... too quiet. Normally, we couldn't have come all this way without any fights.
::'''Pela:''' That may seem like a good thing... But deep down, I'm disturbed by this strange quietness. Anyway, let's be more careful from now on.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Why should we start searching here?
::'''Pela:''' The old citadel runs from the north to the south, and we are now at the southernmost end&mdash;
::'''Pela:''' If we start from here, we can save a trip going backward. Technically, it'd be the same if we were to start from the north. I just picked this direction at random when we came.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay, let's go.
::'''Pela:''' Great, let's go. Even though we didn't encounter any enemies coming here, it's still hard to say what will happen later. If we get into a fight, I will cover you.
::'''Pela:''' If it so happens that you are defeated, I will definitely fight my way to bring you back to a safe place and continue our exploration when you are ready.
::'''Pela:''' But it's best to avoid that. After all, there is only so much help I can give you... So stay sharp, (Trailblazer).

:'''Pela:''' Here we are. Now, on the left, it's a road towards the Fortified Zone, which is just behind the fortress defense line. And on the right, it's the path leading to the Frontline Fortress's parapet.
:'''Pela:''' Let's split up for now. In the Fortified Zone, there is a revolving gear bridge that has the same structure as the one in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. I have to go there to investigate its control terminal.
:'''Pela:''' So, I'll pick the road on the left. In the meantime, please use the path on the right to go to the Frontline Fortress and look for clues there.
:<!--0.5-second delay-->
:{{DIcon}} What if you run into a Fragmentum monster?
::'''Pela:''' On the way here, I checked and found that that road is full of roadblocks and debris. Monsters wouldn't get close to where I'm going.
::'''Pela:''' Plus, all those obstacles are much easier for someone as small as me to pass through, even though I hate to talk about my size. Anyway, I can do it alone.

:{{DIcon}} Aren't there control terminals all around the gear bridge?
::'''Pela:''' This kind of gear bridge is pre-equipped with a data storage terminal. Only through this very specific terminal can you view essential data about the gear bridge.
::'''Pela:''' I need to verify some theories of mine, so I have to investigate this data terminal myself, which is just down the road on the left.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see. Stay safe.
::'''Pela:''' Humph, never underestimate an intelligence officer &mdash; I've worked out every possible scenario, and nothing will go wrong.
::'''Pela:''' So let's split up. After we finish our respective investigations, we shall meet on the other side of the bridge.

:'''Pela:''' Ah, finally! I almost began to think you couldn't make it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A piece of cake.
::'''Pela:''' You handled that with such elegance. Looks like you truly are worth your salt.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you all right?
::'''Pela:''' Thank you for your concern, but I'm fine. I'm an intelligence officer of the Silvermane Guards, after all.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You thought I couldn't do it?
::'''Pela:''' Haha, I was just kidding.
:'''Pela:''' Let's recount what just happened. After checking the data storage terminal, I found that the gear bridge brakes can be released by following the sequence of these given patterns.
:'''Pela:''' However, I still don't quite understand why old Balakin left these passwords behind. So I thought I should meet up with you first and discuss it together.
:'''Pela:''' But who would have thought... The moment I crossed the gear bridge, it started rotating by itself, leaving me on the other side!
:'''Pela:''' I tried to control that thing, but the bridge was locked by an emergency brake.
:'''Pela:''' There was nothing I could do. In a hurry, I called out your name... Fortunately, you heard me. Thank god.
:{{DIcon}} I suppose you know how to release the brakes?
::'''Pela:''' To be honest, before looking at the data terminal, I really didn't know it could work this way... The braking system of the bridge in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone was modified by Serval, and is much easier to use.
::'''Pela:''' Anyway, the strange thing is... I tried operating the terminal according to the instructions, and the gear bridge didn't move at all.
::'''Pela:''' I guess old Balakin somehow modified the instructions himself and purposefully used some outdated instructions as a ruse. If it weren't for you, I would have been stuck here forever. So, I really can't thank you enough.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Why did the gear bridge move on its own?
::'''Pela:''' I was careless... I didn't notice the pressure pedal on the ground.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then let's go kick its butt!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank God, it's over...
