;(Talk to Maintenance Engineer)
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' What? Is it broken again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It kept asking me to refresh...
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' It seems to be some compatibility issues...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Broken "again?"
::'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Well, it sometimes breaks down during maintenance.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Oh no! This is caused by the old units I installed into the terminal today. They looked good to me at the time and I thought they could boost the terminal's computing power.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Looks like we'll have to wait until the replacement units are delivered.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' Sorry, please give me some time. Let me remove these units. I assure you the existing computing power won't be affected.
:'''Maintenance Engineer:''' However, I'm afraid you'll have to {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|come back tomorrow}}. I'm sure by tomorrow there will have been sufficient computing power!
