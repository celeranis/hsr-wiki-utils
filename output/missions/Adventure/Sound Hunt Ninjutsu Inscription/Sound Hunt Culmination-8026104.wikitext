===Help Rappa collect inspiration for composing a song{{subst:void|<!--802610422-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Penacony Paperfold University College|You've become the manager of the music party's performing band, and now your band needs to complete 3 performances on the stage in the middle of the campus.<br />The academy rep kicks the band out of the practice room and declares they want to cancel your eligibility to perform. You decided to forcibly perform on the closing ceremony stage in order to fight against the academy, and you still need to prioritize collecting enough inspiration to help Rappa with composing.}}

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (The closing show is about to start. Time is definitely running short.)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (Huh? That person standing beside Rappa... Isn't that Mr. Reca?)

;(Unused &mdash; EnterDistrict_G179)
:'''Mr. Reca:''' Mm... there's enough of your behind-the-scenes footage to be edited into a whole new film. It's a real pity I wasn't able to follow you guys to film.
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Let me guess... Your plot is near approaching its climax, but you've suddenly run into a few speed bumps?
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Such a plot structure is so yesterday's news. I wouldn't mind giving a little nudge if you need it and see if I can help you all breathe new life into this uninspiring script.
::'''Rappa:''' Thank you, Ninja Gama, for your help... An initiate of our sound ninja school has gone missing. We're trying to find her whereabouts.
::'''Mr. Reca:''' A missing cast member... I don't know who you're looking for, but I've noticed a strange set that popped up in the academy &mdash; or rather, a miniature dreamscape.
::'''Mr. Reca:''' The method to unlock the entrance is recorded in this memory bubble. However, the exact structure of this dreamscape is unknown, as is its origin. It could even have been left behind by one of Dr. Primitive's people.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even so, we have to go!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} For (Dazzling Band/Dazzling Collective/Dazzling Airship/Dazzling Initiate Hotel/Dazzling School Party)!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Worst case, we'll just be turned into monkeys!
::'''Mr. Reca:''' Heh-heh, let me be a spectator this time. I hope you all can weave an exciting tale.

::'''Dafanchy:''' Head Ninja Rappa!
::'''Czipo:''' I've heard some news about the new band. They were also assembled on short notice and are still scrambling to prepare for their performance.
::'''Czipo:''' If the negotiation goes well, there's a high chance that they'll give us the opportunity to perform!
::'''Dafanchy:''' Dreamweaver Academy won't interfere with our actions, but what's more troubling are... those two representatives of the academy.
::'''Rappa:''' Thank you, everyone, for all your help! Now that Sound Master has returned, and our time on stage is about to end, the Dazzling Ninja must split into groups and beat our rivals in the contest.
::'''Rappa:''' ...Ninja Initiate Keyboard, Ninja Initiate Bass &mdash; will you keep studying Sound Ninjutsu, and organize full preparations for subsequent contests?
::'''Czipo:''' No problem! If we can't find a place to practice, you can all use my house's basement &mdash; it's all top-notch equipment!
::'''Dafanchy:''' Yes, if there's not enough time for composition, I can help out too.
::'''Rappa:''' Also, now that we've learned Ninja Initiate Guitar has been imprisoned by scoundrels, I cannot stand idle as Head Ninja.
::'''Rappa:''' No one member of the Dazzling Ninja will be left behind. I will set off now &mdash; I swear to rescue Ninja Initiate Guitar from the clutches of evil, and return to partake in the final stage!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you be able to make it back in time?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about my task?
::'''Rappa:''' The path of dreams is meandering. I know not when I shall return on my journey, but this ninja hero shall forge forth undaunted, unwavering &mdash; if for nothing more than the fact that my companion has been entrapped in danger. If I do not return...
