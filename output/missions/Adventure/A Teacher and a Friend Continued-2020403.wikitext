===Head to the Artisanship Commission and find Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040302-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|Chengjie's enthusiasm has visibly faded, to the point that he even asks Qingque for tips to slack off... What happened to the Chengjie who was shooting for the stars? Let's pay him a visit.<br />You know it is nearly impossible to sustain a career with passion and dreams alone, but Chengjie's excitement seems to have died down a little too quickly.}}

===Head to Machinery District and look for standard aurumaton parts{{subst:void|<!--202040303-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|You only need to change a few parts to install a starskiff's system on an aurumaton? Well, the artisan said so, so you just have to look for the parts.<br />No matter what build an aurumaton is on the Xianzhou, they use standardized parts, what an efficient design.}}

===Hand over the parts to Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040304-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|It is as if you picked up trash by the side of the road. You pick up some standard aurumaton parts, so go ahead and hand it over to Chengjie.<br />It was supposed to be a production material requested from the Artisanship Commission... but let's not worry about that now.}}

===Repair the jade abacus module of the aurumaton{{subst:void|<!--202040391-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|As expected, whenever there is an opportunity to make you fix jade abaci, Luofu residents will take it. Go and give them a hand.<br />You've done it a few times by now. Honestly, it's not difficult to fix, but why does nobody want to do it themselves?}}

===Head to Divination Commission and ask Fu Xuan for help{{subst:void|<!--202040308-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|Qingque mentioned that the Ten-Lords Commission might be able to reunite Masters Chengjie and Ryan for a final time. No matter what the price is, you have to try your luck at the Divination Commission.<br />Luck smiles upon you! Just when you need a helping hand, a judge from the Ten-Lords Commission is present at the Divination Commission!}}

===Head to the Stargazer Navalia and help Xueyi capture the criminal{{subst:void|<!--202040392-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Stargazer Navalia|update|Both the Ten-Lords Commission and the Divination Commission need something of you, and you only need to apprehend the criminal for Madam Xueyi to ask for a favor from her. This is a great deal!<br />Which poor sod needs capturing and questioning?}}

===Activate the Matrix of Prescience Ultima{{subst:void|<!--202040390-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|To accurately locate Master Ryan in the Hall of Karma, you need to activate the Matrix of Prescience Ultima and search for information about the deceased.<br />It sounds like the Matrix of Prescience Ultima can be used to do anything.}}

===Return to the Matrix core and wait for Xueyi to guide the spirit{{subst:void|<!--202040313-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|The three base terminals have been activated, what was left to do is for Madam Xueyi to guide Master Ryan back to the living world. Let's go, to the Matrix core.<br />Chengjie is prepared for the aurumaton to be inhabited. It can't be the one that attacks people, can it?}}

===Speak with Chengjie{{subst:void|<!--202040314-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|Master Ryan tears apart the last of his manuscripts and wants Chengjie to pursue his own dream. What does Chengjie think about that?<br />You understand that having a pursuit is something to be encouraged, and giving up a pursuit is the same... Which decision is the right choice, that depends on you.}}

===Leave the Divination Commission{{subst:void|<!--202040315-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|Only an awkward silence hangs in the air now. Go, leave the Divination Commission and let the Master Diviner and the judge busy themselves with their own business.<br />You understand, you should allow Chengjie some time to digest what has transpired. He'll look for you in a few days anyway.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Chengjie seems to have recovered from his depressed episode. As he said, completing his master's final work could be a good closure, but this did not happen... Go to Starskiff Haven and talk to Chengjie again.<br />His master helped him unload the pressure he placed on himself, but it is still up to him to decide where to go next.}}
