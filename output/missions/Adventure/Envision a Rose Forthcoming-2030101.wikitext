:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel it too...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She looks really tired...
:'''Clockie:''' That lady with the nice voice... she's lacking something in her. You saw what she wrote too, right? She thinks there's a void in her heart, like she forgot something really important.

;(Talk to Giovanna)
:'''Giovanna:''' If you've just woken up from a dream, remember &mdash; this is reality.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Miss Cocona's not feeling well.
:'''Giovanna:''' Cocona? Oh, that luxury goods shop owner... What's wrong with her?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She suddenly became very depressed.
::'''Giovanna:''' A common symptom. Looks like her old problem is acting up again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It feels like she's become somewhat dazed.
::'''Giovanna:''' Ah... probably side effects from the prior treatment.
:'''Giovanna:''' I recall that she received special treatment not too long ago... Did something happen again to upset her?
:'''Giovanna:''' She has a decent job and great income, but is always plagued by such problems &mdash; it really baffles me.
:Giovanna nonchalantly continues working on whatever she has on hand as if it isn't the first time she has encountered this problem.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Miss Cocona ill?
::'''Giovanna:''' High-intensity work will severely burden one's mental well-being. Perhaps she's too stressed at work? Over time, that would eventually cause depression.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What sort of treatment did you give her?
:'''Giovanna:''' The relevant personnel have already "handled" her emotions accordingly. She should have already forgotten all the unhappy memories. Conversely, forgetfulness, sleepiness, and dulled reactions are unavoidable side effects.
:'''Giovanna:''' Please forgive me for not being able to reveal too many details regarding the "treatment." It's a rule set by The Family.
:'''Giovanna:''' Thank you for informing me of Miss Cocona's recent situation. I will dispatch people to deliver more of the "special drink" to her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Special drink?
:'''Giovanna:''' Ah, it's a very special recipe of SoulGlad, specially prepared for those like Cocona &mdash; a special drink unique in the Dreamscapes.
:'''Giovanna:''' Drink it within the Dreamscape and she will temporarily forget her troubles and suppress those negative emotions, allowing her to properly focus on her work and lead a normal life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me deliver it to her then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can deliver it quicker for you.
:'''Giovanna:''' You mean...
:'''Giovanna:''' I understand. I'll give the special drink to you then. Please deliver it to Miss Cocona.
:'''Giovanna:''' You're such a helpful Dreamchaser. I've met many guests from all walks of life &mdash; those with character comparable to yours are few and far between.
:'''Giovanna:''' I'll be troubling you with this matter then. Just as well, I have other guests to look after right now.
:Giovanna is visibly pleased that she can end this conversation quickly. She turns away and busies herself with her many tasks.

;(Talk to Clockie)
:{{tx}}
:'''Clockie:''' Tick-tock, (Trailblazer), I think something's very wrong!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everything is too "normal."
::'''Clockie:''' This is the greatest anomaly!
::Cocona's change is too abrupt.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cocona's change is too abrupt.
:'''Clockie:''' I'm really worried about what she's thinking.
:'''Clockie:''' We patched up Cocona's lost emotion and made her memories somewhat more lucid... But it just made her sadder! I've got a feeling she's being tortured by something horrific!
:'''Clockie:''' I've got a bad feeling that if we leave her alone here, something very bad will happen. We can't leave her alone!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, we can't leave Cocona alone.
:'''Clockie:''' It may be a bit intrusive, but the only thing we can do is to take a look inside her heart! We have to give her a hand if necessary!

:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Cocona... Where could she have gone?)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (I have to find her quickly... I hope everything's all right.)
:'''Cocona:''' Ah, it's you... I felt like I just had a long dream within a dream &mdash; and you were in it too.
:'''Cocona:''' The dream's details... I can't remember them clearly, but I can vaguely feel that...
:Cocona's gaze and yours meet, and her face suddenly flushes red.
:'''Cocona:''' ...I somewhat feel that the reason I'm standing here... is all thanks to you.
:'''Cocona:''' But I've always been in a dream. How could I have fallen asleep? It's all very confusing to me. Could it have been an illusion...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't have to get everything clear...
::'''Cocona:''' That's true...
::It's good that you're all right.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's good that you're all right.
:'''Cocona:''' Thank you... As for the rest of what happened, I think I'd better leave that be.
:'''Cocona:''' I've lived a long time in Penacony &mdash; I'm more than clear that some things are best left unasked.
:'''Cocona:''' I'm now... feeling very good. The last I felt so... refreshed... It felt like a lifetime ago.
:'''Cocona:''' It may be a little embarrassing to say, but I now really want to... sing. I don't know if you know how I feel right now...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It is your dream, after all.
::'''Cocona:''' ...Huh? How did you know that? Have I ever mentioned it to you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go forth and let loose your voice then.
::'''Cocona:''' ...Huh? But I... I don't sing very well...
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come on. Let everyone hear your singing voice!
:'''Cocona:''' ...Huh!? Please... Please hold on...
:You grab Cocona's wrist and take her to Clockie Plaza...
:'''Cocona:''' I... {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mister}}, I'm nervous, and I can feel my knees going weak...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't be afraid. I'm your most avid fan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everyone will love your singing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I will keep applauding you!

;(Talk to Prezzo)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Hmm? It's someone different...)
:'''Prezzo:''' Hello, welcome. What do you need?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} May I ask... where Cocona is?
:'''Prezzo:''' Ah... You mean the previous shop owner? She resigned not long ago.
:'''Prezzo:''' Are you an old customer of Cocona's? I'm really sorry. It's because of... personal reasons... that Cocona has left this store.
:'''Prezzo:''' If you wish it, we can arrange for a new staff member to service you. And don't worry about the quality &mdash; each and every staff member is immaculately professional. I promise you'll be able to find what you want.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm an old friend of Cocona's.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did she mention me?
:Prezzo's brows tighten, his expression a little contorted.
:'''Prezzo:''' Ah... So you're an old customer of shop owner Cocona. I'm truly sorry.
:'''Prezzo:''' I may have some unfortunate news to tell you: Cocona is probably not returning to Penacony. This luxury goods store will have a new owner very soon...

;(Talk to Cocona)
:'''Cocona:''' ''"Close your eyes and look ahead."''
:'''Cocona:''' ''"Those unfinished paintings and the songs that are still playing."''
:'''Cocona:''' ''"What would that vibrant world look like?"''
:With the crowd's encouragement, Cocona loses herself in her song. Her voice becomes more euphonious and confident...
