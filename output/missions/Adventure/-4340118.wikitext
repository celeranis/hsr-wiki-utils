:A notebook &mdash; its corners are yellowed and the majority of the notes within have been rendered incomprehensible by some kind of red rust-like stains.
:When you flip that rather withered, brittle page, a burst of bubbles brimming with bright colors rises from it. They do not linger long in the air and shifts into mirages &mdash; at that moment, you hear a faint sound next to your ears...

:When you focus and try to track down the source of the sound, you only discover that they have disappeared like morning dew in the light that pours down from the curtains, fading without a trace.

:'''Robin:''' I... Sorry, I'm fine. Thank you, (Trailblazer).
::This is the only clue I found.
::'''Robin:''' It is... enough. Thank you, (Trailblazer).
::'''Robin:''' This is... definitely my big brother's handwriting, it should be one of his belongings. But this scripture... The ''Odes of Harmony'' has nothing like this recorded in it.
::'''Robin:''' And... this red residue. So he really...
::Robin chokes on her words.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm really sorry.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We might still be able to turn this thing around.
::Robin simply bows her head, staring dumbly at the journal in her hands, and says nothing. She finally speaks after a long silence.
::'''Robin:''' Yes, we will.
::'''Robin:''' When we reunited at Dreamflux Reef, I had an ominous feeling. That maybe, our paths would not cross again...
::'''Robin:''' It's just... I didn't expect this day to come so soon.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Heaven's will certainly is cruel.
:::'''Robin:''' "Heaven's will"... Heh-heh, who said it wasn't.
:::What do you intend to do?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you intend to do?
::'''Robin:''' I... don't know. There are too many things happening, I'm too confused to process them right now.
::'''Robin:''' All of us &mdash; you, me, my brother, all of us &mdash; we obviously have nothing but kind intentions, to do the best we can in all we do, and to give it our all... but our countless kind acts only end up in tragedy.
::'''Robin:''' This world... is really not very beautiful at all.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But we can make it better.
:::'''Robin:''' You're right. There's plenty more we can do.
:::We can't always get what we want.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We can't always get what we want.
::'''Robin:''' You're right, but... we still have much more to do.
::'''Robin:''' The dream is on the verge of collapse, and many sinister characters are raring to capitalize on the situation. I have to protect this place at all costs, cull it of all impurities, then turn it into something better... I'm sure Sunday would also want me to do so.
::'''Robin:''' Speaking of my brother... though we only found this journal, I don't think it means anything right now. My instincts tell me that he's definitely alive and well somewhere in this dream... and looking for a new way out for the ideal that we share.
::'''Robin:''' I mean... the sky is where the birds belong.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} May your ideals come true soon.
:::'''Robin:''' Yes, I will gladly take your blessing. I'll never back down &mdash; nor have I ever.
:::No matter what, I hope you have no regrets.
:::'''Robin:''' Yes, I hope so too. I'll never back down &mdash; nor have I ever.
:::But first, you have to protect yourself.
