;(Talk to Esther)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 300030105-->)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Have you found your own fashion style?
:::'''Esther:''' To be honest, I'm still looking. It's a bit difficult to fix my bad habit of only paying attention to the latest products.
:::'''Esther:''' But I have a general direction now. I won't fall into the trap of modern fashion again and I have you to thank for that, young one.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Does the Department of Insight suffer the most from this invasion?
:::'''Esther:''' I'm not sure about the other departments. But this invasion is undoubtedly a disaster for us.
:::'''Esther:''' A lot of our files were destroyed. Unlike experimental documents, which they can get the data by repeating the experiment, many Aeon mysteries will be lost forever...
:::'''Esther:''' I may have to contact some ex-colleagues to transcribe some of the files. Things stored in our heads last the longest.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Is there anything I can help with?
:::'''Esther:''' You're such a good kid. You don't look like you are from the Department of Insight. I shouldn't trouble you.
:::'''Esther:''' We've got enough people. A few of my old friends are willing to help.
:::'''Esther:''' If even someone as strong as Wen Tianweng couldn't handle this, I guess I'll have to seek help from you.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} You have great fashion sense.
:::'''Esther:''' Oh, I am flattered. I'll be embarrassed if you keep talking like that.
:::'''Esther:''' However, I guess you are a stylish youngster yourself if you can see my fashion style and my makeup.
:::'''Esther:''' Dressing up every day is my secret to staying energetic and happy. This is my secret.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all I have to ask.
:::'''Esther:''' Feel free to come to me if you have any questions.
