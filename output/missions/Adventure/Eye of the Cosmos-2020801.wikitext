;(Talk to Wenwen)
;(If {{cx}}<!--during performance 202080102--> and {{cx}}<!--Hidden Mission ID 2020802--> has been started)
::'''Wenwen:''' You must be (Trailblazer), right? I've heard a lot about you! I'm Wenwen, a specialist from Heron Express.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's me.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've got the wrong person.
:::'''Wenwen:''' But Xikui gave me a picture of you.
:::'''Wenwen:''' Don't worry. We're legit.
::'''Wenwen:''' I believe Xikui has told you that many Heron Express cargo have been lost in transit.
::'''Wenwen:''' Heron Express wants to commission you to go to the place where these goods were lost and search for them with cycranes from a high vantage point. That would be much more efficient than getting people to manually look for it with just eyes.
::'''Wenwen:''' Those places are complicated in topography and not very safe... You might encounter some dangers along the way.
::'''Wenwen:''' If you're ready, we'll go ahead and move out.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What am I here to do again?
:::'''Wenwen:''' Allow me to repeat... Heron Express hopes to entrust you to go to places where the goods went missing and find them by controlling cycranes.
:::'''Wenwen:''' Side note, these places are not entirely safe, so there might be some dangers along the way. Please be prepared.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go.
:::'''Wenwen:''' What an honor to be able to work alongside {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} (Trailblazer)!

::{{DIcon|Exit}} Maybe later.
:::'''Wenwen:''' Sure. Lemme know when you're ready. We'll head out straight away.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--not during performance 202080102--> and {{cx}}<!--Hidden Mission ID 2020802--> has been started)
::'''Wenwen:''' You're here, (Trailblazer)?
::'''Wenwen:''' We still have some missing cargo to search for with cycranes... If you have the time, can you come over and lend a helping hand?

::{{DIcon|Exit}} I have other things to do...

:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't need my help again, do you?
::::'''Wenwen:''' Did I leave such a bad impression on you last time? Hahahaha
::::'''Wenwen:''' But anyway, if you have time to spare and nothing to do... You catch my drift?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No items have gone missing recently, right?
::::'''Wenwen:''' Hahaha. It shouldn't be a regular thing for a logistics company.
::::'''Wenwen:''' ...Well, Heron Express has indeed lost some items recently. You know what I'm saying?
:::'''Wenwen:''' Don't get all worked up first. I come bearing good news!
:::'''Wenwen:''' I have activated permanent access authentication for you. As you already have access to the roost you managed before, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|you can go back anytime and use the cycranes}} to... uhm... maybe, take photos?
:::'''Wenwen:''' I'd be even happier if you could help me and Heron Express...
:;(If {{cx}}<!--Hidden Mission ID 2020802--> has not been completed and {{cx}}<!--not during performance 202080104-->)
:::'''Wenwen:''' (Trailblazer), we meet again. ...Well, Heron Express has indeed lost some items recently. You know what I'm saying?
:::'''Wenwen:''' Without your experience and expertise, the retrieval efficiency would simply be disastrous. I have no choice but to ask you to help me and Heron Express...
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What do I have to do?
:::'''Wenwen:''' Heron Express hopes to entrust you to go to places where goods have gone missing and find them by controlling cycranes.
:::'''Wenwen:''' Side note, these places are not entirely safe, so there might be some dangers along the way. Please be prepared.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem.
:::'''Wenwen:''' But... our retrieval budget for this has been cut, so we won't able to pay you for your help. Are you still fine with it?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Say no more. Show me the way.
::::'''Wenwen:''' ...You're so nice! Let's hit the road right away.
