===Hit the streets of Starskiff Haven and talk to Tantan{{subst:void|<!--202030102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|There's a message from Secretary Xikui at the Palace of Astrum, who's heard that the speed tester Tantan is planning a trial program called Xianzhou Speed Tester.<br />Counting vehicles is supposed to be easy. If you have the time, go find the speed tester Tantan for a chat.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Tantan)
:'''Tantan:''' You're the person sent by the Palace of Astrum to experience being a starskiff speed tester, aren't you?
:'''Tantan:''' Hold this. We're starting soon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't I need any training?
:'''Tantan:''' Stand on the bridge and hold on to the counter, then look down and count how many starskiffs go past in a set time period. Once you're done, just tell me the count.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's so easy!
::'''Tantan:''' ...Are you saying that counting skiffs on the bridge is not challenging enough?
::'''Tantan:''' Now do you know the kind of work I've been doing all this time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a relaxing job...
::'''Tantan:''' "Is your job really that boring?" "Is this what people mean by getting paid to do nothing?"
::'''Tantan:''' You didn't say it out loud, but I know what you're thinking...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is too hard!
::'''Tantan:''' ...
::'''Tantan:''' Hearing you say that makes me feel a little better. You're not saying that just to console me, are you?
::'''Tantan:''' Of course, you might also just be sarcastic.
:'''Tantan:''' Ahem. So, the position of starskiff speed tester is known by everyone in the Palace of Astrum as the bottom of the occupational pecking order. Anyone who got sent here for a one-day experience would think that this job is an insult to their intelligence and skills.
:'''Tantan:''' Why do we need someone to supervise when we could just deploy an ingenium to measure the speed and issue a ticket?
:'''Tantan:''' Most people are just judging the job based on first impressions. Statistics can of course be done by a machine, but when there is trouble, it is still necessary to rely on humans like us.
:'''Tantan:''' How 'bout this, to give you an idea about how troublesome this job is, let's have a small quiz.
:'''Tantan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Starskiffs of different colors and models will pass through the lanes in Starskiff Haven.}}
:'''Tantan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|You will need to remember the models and colors of all starskiffs that pass by within the specified time period, and I will ask you a few questions at the end.}}
:'''Tantan:''' For example, I might ask {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"How many blue passenger starskiffs went past?"}} That should add some challenge to the experience. What do you think?
:'''Tantan:''' We can start once you're ready.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Wait, I have some questions.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What are the rules again?
:::'''Tantan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Starskiffs of different colors and models will pass through the lanes in Starskiff Haven.}}
:::'''Tantan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|You will need to remember the models and colors of all starskiffs that pass by within the specified time period, and I will ask you a few questions at the end.}}
:::'''Tantan:''' For example, I might ask {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"How many blue passenger starskiffs went past?"}} You will need to answer my questions according to your observation.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What models are there?
::::'''Tantan:''' At the moment, there are only two types of starskiffs allowed on the streets of the Starskiff Haven: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|passenger-type and cargo-type}}.
::::'''Tantan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Freight starskiffs}} are differentiated by the amount of cargo they carry, and are typically colored {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|either in red or green.}}
::::'''Tantan:''' Although {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|passenger starskiffs}} do vary, they generally come in {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|blue, green, or white.}}
