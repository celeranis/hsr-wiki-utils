{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Phantom A:''' Wow! This magic cube is really fun!
:'''Phantom B:''' You're right! Hexanexus truly is the most enjoyable game in the world!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Zhaoxia, your temple fair is haunted!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this some horror game?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ghost-hunting squad! Assemble!
:'''Dahao?:''' Simmer down, player (Trailblazer). These are just AI NPCs to make up the numbers.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dahao? What're you doing here?
::'''Dahao?:''' I've transferred my image rights to the Luofu Temple Fair Preparatory Group, so they can use my virtual emulation as a temple fair guide.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dahao? How'd you die?
::'''Dahao?:''' Don't worry. I'm not dead. I've just transferred my image rights to the Luofu Temple Fair Preparatory Group so they can use my virtual emulation as a temple fair guide.
:{{tx}}
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't sound like the real Dahao at all.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' The budget was severely slashed, and we couldn't hire a professional writer. We called in a lot of favors to hire a borisin called Arma from the Shackling Prison to write the dialogue script for the virtual NPCs.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' "The Arma Correctional Group is sincerely at your service! Snacks and drinks, daily necessities, service with a smile, medicine for our guests! We aim for your every need at Arma Correctional Group!"
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Sorry, saying keywords triggers my tagline.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Anyway, don't mind the details. We're just here to hype people up.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Look, it's not just me. Many colleagues in the Six Commissions have also transferred their image rights to the temple fair &mdash; the entire place will brim with vigor!
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' I mean, otherwise it'll just be the player on their own in the arena, all sad and lonely &mdash; so scary!
:You scrutinize the surrounding virtual NPCs &mdash; you see several familiar faces. You have to say, this all looks very... ominous.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's obviously made everything more creepy.
::'''Virtual Dahao:''' That's all we could muster with our budget. Just make do.
::The time spent on this rubbish could've been better used to raise more funds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The time spent on this rubbish could've been better used to raise more funds.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Raise more funds? Haha, you sure are funny.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' All right, enough chatter, come play the Hexanexus. I trust I don't have to describe this game to you?
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' This game was once the bane of the Realm-Keeping Commission, and now it's featured on the Empathic Immersia platform at the Realm-Keeping Commission's temple fair! What a dream collab!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How did you end up partnering with the Hex Club?
::'''Virtual Dahao:''' Easy, we made 'em an official offer they couldn't refuse!
::I'm really tired of this dang cube...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm really tired of this dang cube...
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Change a gameplay environment, and you might just discover a new experience.
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' Ah, this conversation has almost reached 800 words. The virtual NPC is going to start charging additional server operational fees if you exceed 1,000 words.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eh? You're sentient?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What exactly is the principle behind the virtual NPCs?
:'''Virtual Dahao:''' I'm out of words to elaborate. Have fun by yourself, goodbye.
