;(Talk to Aymille)
:'''Aymille:''' Pleased to meet you. You are much younger than I thought.
:'''Aymille:''' But I shall leave the banter for later. I have come to explain the circumstances on the ground in simple terms.
:'''Aymille:''' I'm sure that you, as one of those who are involved in the incident, are highly aware of the situation regarding the Order's remnants. The decision to have you assist in the search also took confidentiality issues into consideration.
:'''Aymille:''' Sunday has indeed been caught. However, as the Dreammaster had toiled for so many years, he must have nurtured more than one traitor.
:'''Aymille:''' Can you even imagine this? The Hounds have been searching for these traitors all these years, never finding a trace of their whereabouts &mdash; And yet they were hiding right in this Grand Theater! In the painting right behind me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is why the spot underneath the lamp is always the darkest.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You people were incompetent.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A superb move. I'll remember it.
:'''Aymille:''' After enjoying an extended period of peace, our attitudes have indeed grown indolent. We thought the traitor would never be in the Grand Theater because of the building's status in Penacony. This error is a result of our own ignorance.
:'''Aymille:''' The traitors all hid or ran, but it must have been difficult for them to clean up the scene in the rush.
:'''Aymille:''' They set many traps, turning the room in the painting into a maze to impede our search. Come to think of it, there must still be plenty of stolen loot in the room.
:'''Aymille:''' Now, with your help, those traitors won't be able to stop the Hounds no matter how crafty they are. Let's step into the painting and carry out justice for Penacony!

;(Talk to Aymille)
:'''Aymille:''' I remember him... I remember these memories these things are tainted with!
:'''Aymille:''' He was a professor at the Paperfold University twenty years ago. Then, one day he walked into the library and borrowed a collection of historical documents only available to internal staff, then vanished without a trace.
:'''Aymille:''' We once thought he was a History Fictionologist who infiltrated The Family, but now it seems like he wanted to hide this report regarding the trial of the Order's remnants.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did he succeed then?
:'''Aymille:''' In our current perspective? No.
:'''Aymille:''' After all... many witnesses of the trial are still alive.

:'''Aymille:''' The senior butler overseeing The Reverie's affairs, and trusted members of The Family who have been serving faithfully for many Amber Eras &mdash; He's got information on lots of important clients.
:'''Aymille:''' He announced that he was leaving Penacony to find a peaceful world for a holiday a while ago, then disappeared.
:'''Aymille:''' Who knew that he was hiding here and waiting for the Order to create Paradise for them?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, this list of clients...
::'''Aymille:''' A few big fish have gotta be in there. I wonder what their faces would look like when they see this list.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He didn't take such an important item with him?
::'''Aymille:''' He was on the edge of getting caught himself, so the fate of others naturally seemed less important than before.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Won't he get bored?
::'''Aymille:''' With the Order suppressing your desires, a human won't feel "bored" no longer how long they spend holed up in hiding.
:'''Aymille:''' Going by the efficiency of the Dreamweavers, there can only be a max of three spacial overlays in a room that they modified while on the run.
:'''Aymille:''' Just to be sure, let's go make a final round in the painting.

:'''Aymille:''' Darn it! Darn it! Didn't you die during the expedition against the memes? Isn't that the reason why you abandoned me and Ma?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe he had his reasons.
::'''Aymille:''' What kind of reason would get him to betray The Family!? Betray the Great One!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a horrible father.
