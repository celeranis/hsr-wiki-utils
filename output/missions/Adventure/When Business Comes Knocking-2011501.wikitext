:::'''Himeko:''' What's up, (Trailblazer)? Back on the Express slacking off, huh?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here to listen to your stories...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm free for now and want to hear you talk about the past...
:::'''Himeko:''' Oh, I almost forgot about that... Then, to make a long story short, where should I begin?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Himeko, when did you first board the Express?
::::'''Himeko:''' Now that's got me stumped...
::::'''Himeko:''' Seven years, eight years... No, that's not right. I'm sorry. I'm not Dan Heng &mdash; I've never kept a diary aboard the Express.
::::'''Himeko:''' The Express traverses through different worlds, and the flow of time can become blurry...
::::'''Himeko:''' But I'm clear about the beginning of my story with the Express. That day just so happened to be my birthday. Back then, I was hiking outdoors and looking for a place without any light pollution to observe the light and orbit of Heaven's Finger.
::::'''Himeko:''' Then, using a telescope, I saw a bright spot streak across the sky. I thought it was a comet and thought nothing of it.
::::'''Himeko:''' But it wasn't until the spot grew bigger and bigger that I realized there was something wrong... That thing pierced straight through the atmosphere without burning up, and flew straight at me.
::::'''Himeko:''' So I drove as fast as I could to get out of there, until I heard a loud crash behind me as if the entire world had been flipped upside down...
::::'''Himeko:''' I saw a train half-buried in a huge crater. When it happened, I said to myself that this cannot possibly be a thing of this world. It's too dangerous to get close to it...
::::'''Himeko:''' But, out of basic human curiosity, I dared to take a closer look. I keep thinking to myself, just one look, just one look.
::::'''Himeko:''' So, I figured out a way to go inside the Express. The internal structure was incredible, especially its engine...
::::'''Himeko:''' By the time I came to my senses, I had already passionately finished fixing the Express and was already embarking on a journey aboard it.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of wild plot is this?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is mind-control, right?
:::::'''Himeko:''' Many developments in life are inherently unexpected or uncontrollable, just like your experience with the Express.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} When did you and Mr. Yang meet?
::::'''Himeko:''' About that... Um... When did Welt get here?
::::'''Himeko:''' Many years ago, Pom-Pom and I were tasked by Herta to go to the abandoned and ruined world of Salsotto, looking for a special material called Cadence Glass...
::::'''Himeko:''' Just as the Express finished its warp jump, we picked up an unknown signal. It was coming from the wreckage of a huge starship.
::::'''Himeko:''' Based on the ''Express Safety Manual'', such an obviously dangerous signal should be ignored. You have no idea whether the party sending the signal is a victim needing rescue, or a bandit lurking behind a trap...
::::'''Himeko:''' But out of basic human curiosity, we decided to take a look and immediately set out for Salsotto to do our business.
::::'''Himeko:''' Welt joined up with us after that.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait... You're missing lots of details, aren't you?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What exactly happened?
::::'''Himeko:''' There was no torturous rescue process, just the normal procedures. In the end, there were two new passengers on the Express.
::::'''Himeko:''' They chose to work for the Express as a way to say thanks for saving their lives and pay off their rescue-related expenses.
::::'''Himeko:''' How about that? Is that good enough to satisfy your curiosities?
::::'''Himeko:''' Well, satisfied or not, you can ask Welt if you have any more questions. If you'll excuse me, (Trailblazer), I have to get on my work now.
:;(If {{cx}}<!--not during performance 599000103-->)

::'''Himeko:''' Oh, back so soon?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We narrowly averted disaster, and now we're home.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We almost didn't make it back...
::'''Himeko:''' Hah, it seems this world is a dangerous place, too. Ever since the Astral Express embarked on this journey, every world contaminated by the Stellaron has been problematic.
::'''Himeko:''' Before the three of you boarded the Express, Welt, I... and someone else were adventuring together. It was the same back then as well &mdash; we would slowly trailblaze new worlds, find the Stellaron, and clear a path...
::'''Himeko:''' No matter what world we were on, some difficulties remain constant &mdash; misunderstandings caused by communication, enmity caused by cultural differences, and enemies with malicious intentions. But there is always something new.
::'''Himeko:''' Keep up the good work, (Trailblazer).
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've never mentioned these things before...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to hear about your past...
::'''Himeko:''' You've still got work to do. As for me, I've got to maintain the Express while it is parked.
::'''Himeko:''' We can take a long break after we're done with this world. Come find me if you're still interested then.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the history of the Express...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 119.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Astral Express was a tool created by Akivili the Trailblaze, who used it to transport THEMSELF and the Nameless across the galaxy. It is rumored that there are other vehicles like it, but the Express has no such records.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' When I found the Express, its memory had been severely damaged, with much of its valuable information lost. All I know is that the Express is an Aspect of Creation built by Akivili themself, and used to travel the cosmos.

::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 122.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Express is traveling on a route that the Trailblazer once embarked on. The names of some destinations have been lost, but the first and final stops were both at Pegana &mdash; Akivili's home world.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 123.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' We speculate the Astral Express started its journey from Pegana, stopping at each destination along the way before returning there for its next journey. However, the appearance of the Stellarons has caused a delay at each stop.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Express' source of power...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 124.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' There is a legend in the galaxy: The heart of Akivili themself lies in the core of the Astral Express, providing it with the power to travel between worlds. But I found no evidence of that aboard the Express.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 125.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Besides, the Express existed before the Trailblaze fell. There's no way they could have had two hearts, right? However, it is likely that the Express possesses some sort of mechanism to transfer power from the Trailblaze.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 126.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It wouldn't be possible with a normal Pathstrider.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Akivili...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 127.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The fallen Aeon, deceased Trailblaze &mdash; THEIR passing is still a mystery, but of all the known Aeons, Akivili was the closest to mankind.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 128.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' In the databank aboard the Express, it is recorded that THEY walked among the mortals &mdash; adventuring, fighting, and celebrating with THEM. Although THEY were an Aeon restrained by the "Primum Mobile," Akivili enjoyed a freedom similar to us mortals.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 129.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' THEY were different from most... But THEIR passing came so suddenly that it was thought THEY were killed by another Aeon. I don't believe that to be the case.

:::{{DIcon|Return}} I have another question...
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the galaxy...
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 130.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The galaxy is endlessly vast. I wouldn't know where to begin, especially if you ask me that so suddenly...
:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About its nature...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 131.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I've been to many different worlds, yet I still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. As for its nature, there are a few theories that I can share with you.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 132.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The most popular is probably the Cosmos Tree theory, proposed by Zandar, Emanator of Erudition and the first member of the Genius Society. He compared the galaxy to an enormous imaginary tree, with its leaves being individual universes.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 133.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Therefore, only Aeons, who draw their energy from the imaginary, and Emanators, who are blessed by Aeons, can travel through the spaces filled with imaginary energy. That's why planets where civilizations exist are so similar.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 134.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' However, the theory has its flaws. Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society, invented remote detection, disproving that the imaginary is unique. This shook the foundation of the "Cosmos Tree" theory.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 135.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' There are other theories as well: The "Stretching" theory, the "Heat Torch" theory, and the "Parallel Imaging" theory... The Riddlers claim the galaxy is just a dream and IX's followers seem to like that claim.
:::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Aeons...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 136.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Aeons are the most mysterious beings in the galaxy. All we know is that THEY ascended from the form of intelligent beings. As for the how and why, even the geniuses over at the Genius Society haven't the slightest clue.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 137.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Upon ascending to Aeon-hood, that being gains power over the Paths, free to choose the allocation of imaginary energy however THEY wish, while suffering the restrictions of the "Primum Mobile."
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 138.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Aeon of Destruction seeks only to destroy the universe, while the Aeon of Erudition wants to find the answer for all that exists.

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the factions...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 140.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Compared to the Aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. Mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of Aeons and the Paths.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 141.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Many Aeons are unreachable, but the factions are close to us. After Akivili trailblazed across the galaxy, people became aware of the existence of other worlds. Gradually, more people started trying to use the power of the Aeons to travel between worlds.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 142.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Interastral Peace Corporation is a good example: They worship Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 143.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Another example is the Genius Society: There is no shortage of eccentrics like Madam Herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the Erudition.

::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 146.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' A person is considered to be on a Path when their will overlaps with that Path. If the person has a strong enough will, they can draw power from that Path. Those who can do so are called Pathstriders.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 147.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Pathstriders possess extraordinary power, but are still insignificant compared to the Aeons, like a drop of water in a vast ocean. Sometimes, Aeons will bestow a mortal with their power, making them an "Emanator" of that Aeon.

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About its nature...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 131.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I've been to many different worlds, yet I still know very little about the galaxy, simply because it's too vast. As for its nature, there are a few theories that I can share with you.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 132.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The most popular is probably the Cosmos Tree theory, proposed by Zandar, Emanator of Erudition and the first member of the Genius Society. He compared the galaxy to an enormous imaginary tree, with its leaves being individual universes.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 133.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Therefore, only Aeons, who draw their energy from the imaginary, and Emanators, who are blessed by Aeons, can travel through the spaces filled with imaginary energy. That's why planets where civilizations exist are so similar.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 134.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' However, the theory has its flaws. Elias Salas, the 56th member of the Genius Society, invented remote detection, disproving that the imaginary is unique. This shook the foundation of the "Cosmos Tree" theory.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 135.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' There are other theories as well: The "Stretching" theory, the "Heat Torch" theory, and the "Parallel Imaging" theory... The Riddlers claim the galaxy is just a dream and IX's followers seem to like that claim.

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Aeons...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 136.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Aeons are the most mysterious beings in the galaxy. All we know is that THEY ascended from the form of intelligent beings. As for the how and why, even the geniuses over at the Genius Society haven't the slightest clue.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 137.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Upon ascending to Aeon-hood, that being gains power over the Paths, free to choose the allocation of imaginary energy however THEY wish, while suffering the restrictions of the "Primum Mobile."
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 138.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Aeon of Destruction seeks only to destroy the universe, while the Aeon of Erudition wants to find the answer for all that exists. Meanwhile, the Aeon of Preservation continues to forge walls, and the Aeon of Enigmata devotes themself to obscuring all that is known...

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the factions...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 140.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Compared to the Aeons, the factions are much easier to understand. Mortals with the same objective gather together to practice their understanding of Aeons and the Paths.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 141.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Many Aeons are unreachable, but the factions are close to us. After Akivili trailblazed across the galaxy, people became aware of the existence of other worlds. Gradually, more people started trying to use the power of the Aeons to travel between worlds.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 142.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Interastral Peace Corporation is a good example: They worship Qlipoth, the Aeon of Preservation, but somehow became the largest economic entity in the galaxy;
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 143.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Another example is the Genius Society: There is no shortage of eccentrics like Madam Herta who dedicate themselves to scientific research under the protection of the Erudition.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 144.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' These factions possess the same power as us to voyage between worlds. It would be hard to travel through the galaxy without them.

:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Paths...
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 145.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The birth of an Aeon gives rise to a Path. The nature of the Paths remains a mystery, leaving us to draw an analogy in a way that mortals can understand: It's a philosophical concept of sorts.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 146.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' A person is considered to be on a Path when their will overlaps with that Path. If the person has a strong enough will, they can draw power from that Path. Those who can do so are called Pathstriders.

::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 147.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Pathstriders possess extraordinary power, but are still insignificant compared to the Aeons, like a drop of water in a vast ocean. Sometimes, Aeons will bestow a mortal with their power, making them an "Emanator" of that Aeon.
::::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 himeko 149.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I should mention that once a Path is open, it cannot be closed, even with the fall of its Aeon. That is how we are still able to travel across the stars, despite Akivili's passing.

:'''Himeko:''' It was the Express.
::'''Himeko:''' I saw a train half-buried in a huge crater. When it happened, I said to myself that this cannot possibly be a thing of this world. It's too dangerous to get close to it...
::'''Himeko:''' But, out of basic human curiosity, I dared to take a closer look. I keep thinking to myself, just one look, just one look.
::'''Himeko:''' So, I figured out a way to go inside the Express. The internal structure was incredible, especially its engine...
::'''Himeko:''' By the time I came to my senses, I had already passionately finished fixing the Express and was already embarking on a journey aboard it.

:'''Welt:''' Good work, (Trailblazer). And with that, we can finally have records on the time before and after the Eternal Freeze in our data bank.
:'''Himeko:''' You never let us down, (Trailblazer). I suppose if we ever have a problem, we can just leave it in your capable hands. Now then, we can finally give that reward to...
