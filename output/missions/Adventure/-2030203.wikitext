:'''Tizocic III:''' Dear Dreamchaser! The late Emperor has left Penacony. I, Tizocic III will inherit the throne and carry on the duties of the late Emperor.
:'''Tizocic III:''' If you are in need of help or are in any kind of trouble, feel free to approach me.
:'''Tizocic III:''' It is my duty and honor to serve my subjects!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know what kind of person is the late Emperor like?
::'''Tizocic III:''' That's not important, my dear subject. What matters most is what kind of Emperor I am!
::'''Tizocic III:''' I am an Emperor who is dedicated to the happiness of her subjects!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's your relationship with the late Emperor?
::'''Tizocic III:''' I was not chosen by the people. The reason why I am willing to ascend to the throne is because I am willing and able to continue the legacy left by my predecessor.
::'''Tizocic III:''' To take over her greatest political legacy &mdash; goodwill!
:'''Tizocic III:''' In any case, whatever you need, feel free to discuss it with me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to have a chat with you.
::'''Tizocic III:''' No problem. It's the Emperor's duty to communicate with her subjects.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} The late Emperor was apparently a tyrant.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' Yes yes yes... I know she was a tyrant, and many have died by her hand.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' More than one subject has brought this issue up to me. I am fully aware!
:::'''Tizocic III:''' So what if she was a tyrant? The good deeds she accomplished cannot be overshadowed by the wrongs she committed, just as the evils she committed cannot tarnish the good she had done.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' I will continue her legacy of kindness till the day I die.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why do you want to inherit the throne?
:::'''Tizocic III:''' Because this is Penacony, the greatest money pit in the cosmos. It is full of evil, greed and betrayal.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' If the remaining kindness here is not inherited, it will soon disappear. It will be neglected, forgotten and trampled on by people.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' Hence, I must become the next Emperor, to ensure that kindness will endure.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Exit}} I don't have any other questions.
:::'''Tizocic III:''' Sure! If you encounter any troubles, remember to come to me anytime! It gives me untold happiness to dispel any troubles for my subjects!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's nothing at the moment.
::'''Tizocic III:''' Sure! If you encounter any troubles, remember to come to me anytime! It gives me untold happiness to dispel any troubles for my subjects!
