;(Screen fades to black)
:You &mdash; or more precisely &mdash; the protagonist of the dream bubble, wake up with a throbbing head.
:Right when Brother Hanu takes control of the prison, an accident occurs: A chaotic Synesthesia Dreamscape engulfs you all, and pulls the entire prison in it.
:The once-familiar corridors have become completely different, and your companions, who have been fighting alongside you, are nowhere to be found.
:You realize that someone has to step up and save everyone. It is time to become a hero.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think they are being trapped elsewhere.
:'''Your Cellmate:''' ...Looks like we're on our own. Let's go find the others, or at least locate Hanu. He has a knack for uniting the other prisoners.
