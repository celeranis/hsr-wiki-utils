;(Talk to Dunn)
:'''Dunn:''' Alright, what would you like to chat about?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} I heard you also do a bit of rock and roll?
::'''Dunn:''' Haha, it all happened when I was still in cadet school... Although we were reserve officers, we were still students at the end of the day. So we needed some after-school hobbies to spend our excess energy.
::'''Dunn:''' I formed a rock band with a few like-minded friends, which was quite famous in the cadet school back then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who was in your band?
::'''Dunn:''' Serval, she's our guitarist and lead singer. She was absolutely charming and talented. She totally deserved her position.
::'''Dunn:''' I was her keyboardist... and the two of us always worked quite well together. I always felt like we were... Ahem, nothing.
::'''Dunn:''' The next one is the drummer &mdash; this one will shock you! Do you want to guess who it is? Here's a hint &mdash; they're also a member of the Silvermane Guards.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Gepard?
:::'''Dunn:''' Uh... he's a high-ranking officer in the Guards for sure, but he doesn't get along with his sister.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Pela?
:::'''Dunn:''' What a guess! She didn't tell you beforehand, did she?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Could it be Cocolia?
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Be careful with your words, outsider!
::'''Dunn:''' The correct answer is Pela. Hard to believe, right? The petite, meticulous intelligence officer is actually a drummer in a rock band... I guess there's too much pressure on the job?
::'''Dunn:''' I heard that Pela and Serval still do band practice and live performances together regularly, just like old times...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There were only three of you in the band?
::'''Dunn:''' No, I remember there was another person... Who was it again? I can't believe it, I actually can't remember who it was...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Doesn't a rock band need a bass player?
:::'''Dunn:''' Ah&mdash;yes, yes, the bass player! I just remembered it after hearing it from you. Haha...but what was his name again? Wait, was the bass player a guy or a girl...
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Eh, never mind. I just can't remember. Don't worry about that person, it's not important.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know much about rock bands, sorry.
:::'''Dunn:''' ...Eh, never mind. I just can't remember. Don't worry about that person, it's not important.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You and Serval...
::'''Dunn:''' ...
::'''Dunn:''' It's history already. Sometimes letting go is the best choice...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of job did you do in the military?
::'''Dunn:''' I am responsible for the general management of the support lines in the restricted zone. Munitions, logistics, energy... all of these are under my control.
::'''Dunn:''' I am also responsible for direct communication with the front line. If the front line was breached... my boys and I would have to form the last line of defense to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the city.
::{{DIcon|Return}} That sounds dangerous.
:::'''Dunn:''' Fortunately, we have Captain Gepard... So things like that have never happened.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Return}} That doesn't sound very dangerous.
:::'''Dunn:''' It's all thanks to Captain Gepard... At least so far, there has never been a record of a Fragmentum monster getting out of the restricted zone.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all.
::'''Dunn:''' Later!
