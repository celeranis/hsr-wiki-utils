{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Herta's Office|The Simulated Universe's storage was more limited than Herta expected! The data packs are at their limit and soon, the entire thing is going to stop working. Herta is prepared to see this thing through to the end by your side. Hurry and save all the previous Aeon data and ensure a proper end to this test before experiencing THEIR glory once more.}}

:'''Herta:''' Screwllum just reminded me, "Universe data encapsulation is about to reach capacity. Timely storage is highly recommended."
:'''Herta:''' Looks like this is the limit for data capacity in one test. We'll have to clear the previous data if we want to continue.
:'''Herta:''' But I think this is enough. Let's make a final summary and wrap up this topic.

;(Talk to Herta)
:{{A|VO SideX sys2 herta 132.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Don't forget to test my Simulated Universe!
