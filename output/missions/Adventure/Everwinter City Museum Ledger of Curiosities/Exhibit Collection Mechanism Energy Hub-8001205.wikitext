:'''Uldan:''' Just in the nick of time, (Trailblazer). I've just gone over all the exhibits in the storage room, and stumbled across this old photo.
::'''Uldan:''' These would all be great for the General Hall, but they're scattered all over Belobog now &mdash; and I'm afraid there's no way an old-timer like me can get to them all...
::'''Uldan:''' It would be great if you could fetch for me from {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the Robot Settlement}} this {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|energy hub}}.
::'''Uldan:''' I've written its approximate location on the back of the photo. I have to trouble you with another trip, (Trailblazer).

::'''Uldan:''' Welcome to the Belobog History and Culture Museum, {{MC|f=young miss|m=young man}}. Is there anything an old man like me can help you with?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just here to visit the museum.
:::'''Uldan:''' Oh hoho, you're at the wrong place. This is the museum's warehouse. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here solely to talk with older people.
:::'''Uldan:''' Hah, what a unique hobby. However, this is a museum after all. Since you're here, might as well have a tour. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::'''Uldan:''' If you have any questions along your tour, or if you have any feedback or opinions, welcome to come talk to me...
