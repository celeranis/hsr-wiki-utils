{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Neverwinter Workshop|The Belobog History and Culture Museum is about to open, but there is a great lack of guides. To rapidly fill up these positions and improve the visitor experience, Pela and Eris are inviting all Belobog citizens to apply for these positions.<br />This time they have their eye on the talented Serval. Head to the Neverwinter Workshop in their stead, and see whether Serval is interested in the position.}}

:'''Serval:''' Hey, isn't this (Trailblazer)? How can I help you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you interested in volunteering at the museum?
:'''Serval:''' What a coincidence! You came asking about this right after Pela left.
:'''Serval:''' She passed me an application form and asked me to fill it out, submit it to the museum reception desk, and wait for the call for an interview. I'm still on the fence now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Apply now! You'll get paid daily and three square meals on the house.
::'''Serval:''' Well then, the application doesn't sound like too much trouble now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seems like you are not interested.
::'''Serval:''' That's not really the case. I just find the application too troublesome.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My goodness, is it that much of a hassle?
::'''Serval:''' Haha, exactly... It's typical of the Architects.
:'''Serval:''' Still, Pela's right. Everyone in this city knows we are friends. We'll get flak if we don't go through the normal process.
:'''Serval:''' You're here at the right time. Could you take a look at my resume to see if it needs any modifications?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure. Leave it to me.
::'''Serval:''' I know I can always count on you. I'll entrust my resume to you then!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I charge extra for resume writing tips...
::'''Serval:''' Hey, you're getting better at doing business! How about you help me manage this workshop after you get the museum thing over with?
::'''Serval:''' Just kidding. Well, I'll entrust my resume to you then.

:'''Serval:''' Which part of the resume do you think can be improved?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It looks surprisingly formal...
::'''Serval:''' Haha, it's not like something I would write, isn't it?
::'''Serval:''' To be honest, back when I was doing research in the Technology Division, I spent 60% of my time dealing with all the messy forms coming from Qlipoth Fort...
::'''Serval:''' ...to the point where now, whenever I see a form header that says "Belobog," "Silvermane Guards," or "Qlipoth Fort," my hand just starts moving on its own and I can't write anything else.
::'''Serval:''' But then again, this is the preferred style in the Qlipoth Fort, so it should be fine. Or... do you think I should let loose a little?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should let loose!
:::'''Serval:''' Well, what do you think I should write?
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} You may make changes to the "Name"...
::::'''Serval:''' Change my name? Seriously?
::::'''Serval:''' But give it another thought... since you want me to be myself, I'll do it!
::::'''Serval:''' Write this: "Belobog's one and only rock'n'roll superstar and mechanics genius, Serval Landau." How does that sound?
::::{{DIcon|Return}} Sounds cool to me! Let's use it.
