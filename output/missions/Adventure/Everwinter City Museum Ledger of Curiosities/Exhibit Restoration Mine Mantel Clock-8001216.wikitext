;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' What am I going to do... Oh, (Trailblazer). Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.
::'''Uldan:''' We have several exhibits on loan from other departments, and they've all been broken. My problem is, if they can't be fixed, the Museum will have to pay up compensation...
::'''Uldan:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Boris}} is rushing repairs in the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|museum workshop}} right now. It's too much for one person to handle. Please, can you help him?

:::{{DIcon|?}} About the portrait of Cyrille the Fool...
::::'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer)... Did you say that the description of {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cyrille the Fool's}} portrait deviated from the truth?
::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Still, I can tell you have at least heard of Cyrille from your tone.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have evidence that supports Cyrille.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Since you sound so sure of yourself, I'll take a look at your evidence.
