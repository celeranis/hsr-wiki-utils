{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=History and Culture Museum|Belobog's History and Culture Museum will be opening soon.

{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' Oh? Hi there. You're here to collect {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Belobog Landscape Paintings}}, right?
::'''Uldan:''' As you can see, three exhibits of the same category are still missing in the General Hall. They are all made by the great painter {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Rebini}}.
::'''Uldan:''' A graduate of the Belobog College of Art, he is currently the icon of the nomadist school and the pinnacle of this city's art scene.
::'''Uldan:''' Although he has promised to submit his commissions on time, I know him too well... He must have procrastinated till the last minute. I bet he is working flat out somewhere right now to complete his work.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So I gotta pay him a visit in his studio to chase him up?
:::'''Uldan:''' No, I'm sure he won't be there. He hates doing his work in isolation. If possible, he will definitely paint outdoors.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No clue where he's at? Did he just bail out on you to avoid trouble?
:::'''Uldan:''' Haha. Unlikely. He hates doing his work in isolation. If possible, he will definitely paint outdoors.
::'''Uldan:''' Let me check which paintings are still missing...
::'''Uldan:''' ...Got it. Looks like I'll have to task you with a trip to the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Outlying Snow Plains}}. If everything goes as planned, he should be over there.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm on it and I'll be back in a jiffy.
:::'''Uldan:''' Great, off you go then...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if things don't go as planned?
:::'''Uldan:''' Then I'll go visit his studio myself. If nobody's there, all we can do is pray that he's safe and well...
::'''Uldan:''' ...Oh yeah, take this. We've agreed to settle things in cash, and here's the money. If he's done painting, then you can hand this over to him immediately.
::'''Uldan:''' But this dude's got a quirky temper. If he insists on not taking the payment, don't waste your time. Just keep it as a delivery fee for yourself.

:::{{DIcon|?}} About the portrait of Cyrille the Fool...
::::'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer)... Did you say that the description of {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cyrille the Fool's}} portrait deviated from the truth?
::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.

===Find Rebini in the Outlying Snow Plains{{subst:void|<!--800120102-->}}===
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Rebini)
:'''Rebini:''' The melody of your footsteps echoes in the silent snowdrift...
:'''Rebini:''' Just like a drifting snow phantom &mdash; you've come in the dead of winter!
:'''Rebini:''' And so, you are...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm (Trailblazer).
::'''Rebini:''' (Trailblazer)! What a delightful name! Nice to meet you.
::'''Rebini:''' Hmm, have we met somewhere before...
::'''Rebini:''' ...Ah, forget it. That's not important! My name's Rebini, and I'm currently absorbed in creating an exhibit for the Belobog History and Culture Museum!
::'''Rebini:''' So then, {{MC|m=Sir|f=Ma'am}} (Trailblazer), what can I humbly do for you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've come to talk art with you.
:::'''Rebini:''' Heavens, that's unbelievable... Someone is coming all the way out to this icy frostscape just to talk art with me...
:::'''Rebini:''' What great timing. I've just finished with this landscape piece &mdash; a vista overlooking Belobog &mdash; and I'm gonna call it ''Ray of Dawn''!
:::'''Rebini:''' It's finished, but... I can't help but feel like it's missing something, somewhere. Seeing as you're someone who understands art, could you give this a once over? What do you think of this painting?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uldan sent me with a message...
:::'''Rebini:''' Stop! Stop that! That wretched old man again!? I told him, soon, soon &mdash; I'll finish it soon! Quit bugging me!
:::'''Rebini:''' But you've got great timing. I've just finished with this landscape &mdash; a vista overlooking Belobog &mdash; and I'm gonna call it ''Ray of Dawn''!
:::'''Rebini:''' It's finished, but... I can't help but feel like it's missing something, somewhere. What do you think of this painting?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uldan sent me to chase up this painting.
::'''Rebini:''' Uldan! What a delightful name! Nice to meet you!
::'''Rebini:''' ...Pah! That wretched old man again!? I told him, soon, soon &mdash; I'll finish it soon! Quit bugging me!
::'''Rebini:''' But you've got great timing. I've just finished with this landscape &mdash; a vista overlooking Belobog &mdash; and I'm gonna call it ''Ray of Dawn''!
::'''Rebini:''' It's finished, but... I can't help but feel like it's missing something, somewhere. What do you think of this painting?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rational analysis.
::From the composition to the color palette and the communication of motifs, you pull out all the stops to offer up all the insight you can give.
::'''Rebini:''' ...
::'''Rebini:''' ...
::'''Rebini:''' {{Size|36|That's perfect! That's exactly what I wanted to hear!}}
::'''Rebini:''' You're really insightful about art! With this kind of suggestion, this painting will be more dazzling than the geomarrow ores in the museum!
::Rebini hastily makes revisions to the painting based on your feedback.
::'''Rebini:''' Oh... Oh my... You're right! Now this version of ''Ray of Dawn'' is the finished item!
::'''Rebini:''' Thank you so much, my friend! I'm sending it in to that old man Uldan right now &mdash; I want him to know that every delay of mine was worth it!
::{{Black Screen|Rebini runs off on his own.}}
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (Then... I get to keep his fee, I suppose?)

::You compare this perfect picture to celestial motion, filling every sentence with gushing praise for the great painter &mdash; despite your doubt that he even understands what "celestial motion" in fact means.
::'''Rebini:''' ...
::'''Rebini:''' ...
::'''Rebini:''' Thanks for the compliment... But that wasn't the answer I was looking for.
::'''Rebini:''' Let's finish this. I can tell already... That old man Uldan got you to chase up his commission &mdash; he's also the one who taught you to talk like this, right?
::'''Rebini:''' In that case, I will keep things transactional. He didn't forget the fee, did he?
