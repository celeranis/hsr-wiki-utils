;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), there's something I need your help with.
::'''Uldan:''' We're trying to get more visitors in, so the museum is after some photos from which to model replicas. Can you please go and snap a few pictures of the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Antimatter Legion's ice sculptures}}?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why the Antimatter Legion's ice sculptures?
:::'''Uldan:''' Haha, compared with normal relics and artworks, those ice sculptures are far more of an attraction.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't you need photos of any other exhibits?
:::'''Uldan:''' No. Even if we put them out, everyone's focus would still be on the ice sculptures.
::'''Uldan:''' Please show me the photo once you've taken it. {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|One photo}} should be enough.
