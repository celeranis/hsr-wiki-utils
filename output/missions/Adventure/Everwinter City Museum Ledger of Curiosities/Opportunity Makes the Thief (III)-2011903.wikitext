;(Talk to Pela)
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 282 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 282 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' (Trailblazer), good to see you again! I've heard from Miss Eris that under your superb management, the museum is on the verge of regaining the thriving crowds of its heyday.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 283.ogg}} '''Pela:''' If the momentum continues, and if the History-Culture Hall can reopen on schedule... the museum's complete revival is surely just around the corner!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What went missing this time?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 284.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...So you guessed it already.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good thing you have me around.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 285.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Ahem. Yes, indeed.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 286.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...I'm afraid there's been another theft. Like the previous cases, a valuable item was stolen from our exhibit &mdash; this time in the History-Culture Hall. The item in question has a connection to you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was it a photo of me? I can always take a new one for you.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 287.ogg}} '''Pela:''' No. As you just pointed out, that kind of thing is easily replaced.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was it my weapon? Here &mdash; I'll give it to you right now.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 288.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Uh, that won't be necessary &mdash; we've already made a high-quality replica.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So what is it?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 289.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Hehe, have I piqued your curiosity?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 290.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It'll be easier to explain once we're actually in the History-Culture Hall. Why don't I take you there now?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 291 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 291 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' With an exhibit like this, all Belobogians will know your story, (Trailblazer).

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=History and Culture Museum|update|Pela was satisfied with the results you achieved while operating the museum.<br />She wants to open up the History Exhibit next, but a key exhibit in this area was stolen. Go and see what the situation is.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 292.ogg}} '''Pela:''' You can probably guess from the name that the History-Culture Hall houses artifacts, replicas, and documents that are of great historical significance to Belobog.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 293.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Every passing day, we Belobogians must continue to endure the city's harsh environment. The trials and experiences of our ancestors serve as a reminder that the path of survival belongs to every generation of our people.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 294.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Every child in Belobog should visit this exhibit at least once... No, once isn't nearly enough.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 296.ogg}} '''Pela:''' This projector is a limited-edition version custom-made for the museum &mdash; the only one of its kind in the whole of Belobog. It can produce images with a resolution of up to...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 297.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Oh, sorry, I'm doing my tour guide thing again. I'm sure someone as well-traveled as yourself has seen much fancier equipment than this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So broken, not stolen? Let's ask Serval.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 298.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Oh, uh, that's not the issue...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wowee! This is so high tech!
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 299.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Nice try keeping a straight face.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 300.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The issue isn't the projector, but the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|microfilm}} that goes into it. It's the most crucial piece of this exhibit, and it was stolen.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 301.ogg}} '''Pela:''' There were some very valuable images on that film, and we hadn't gotten around to making a backup... I must admit, the thieves chose a good target, and they were fast and efficient.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 302.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Slide projection is a new addition to the museum &mdash; it was intended to be a surprise for visitors when the History-Culture Hall reopened. If we don't recover the microfilm, the Hall's opening will have to be postponed indefinitely.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 303.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Some of the images stored on that film are related to you, Miss March 7th, and Master Dan Heng. The curators of the museum wanted to take this opportunity to tell the story of the Astral Express' visit to Belobog.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You did a secret photoshoot of us?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 304.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Uhh... th&mdash;that's beside the point.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No worries. We can just do a reshoot.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 305.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The parts related to you are only a small portion of the collection...

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 307.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Was that a message from Lady Bronya? Hm, this theft case has been dragging on for too long &mdash; she must have decided to intervene...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 308.ogg}} '''Pela:''' If she can delegate more resources to the investigation, that should help it move forward faster.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 107.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' Oh, as a matter of fact, I do. I noticed you two had been wandering around Administrative District Plaza for some time now, stopping to ask questions at every turn, so I surmised you were investigating something important.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 108.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' As it so happens, I witnessed a strange incident recently that left me quite puzzled... After reflecting on it for a time, I decided it would be most appropriate to inform public officials.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 335.ogg}} '''Pela:''' This incident... is it related to the museum thefts?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 109.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' I can't say for sure that it's directly related, but a friend of mine I no longer hear from used to frequent the museum, and often talked about its exhibits with a group of us tea lovers.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 336.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So by "no longer hear from," you mean you've been unable to get in touch with this friend of yours?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 110.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' Precisely! His name is Norbert &mdash; we used to chat during lunch breaks in the lobby of the Goethe Hotel &mdash; along with a few other high-class individuals, of course.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 111.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' And one day, Norbert suddenly stopped showing up to our tea parties. It was as though he disappeared into thin air. I still remember the last thing he said to me...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 112.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' "Limestein, listen to me &mdash; one must be ambitious in life. I'm gonna do something big for once!"
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 337.ogg}} '''Pela:''' "Be ambitious in life, do something big for once..." Coming from the mouth of a wealthy gentleman, that sounded rather curious to me.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 113.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' I'm not entirely sure &mdash; I never asked.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Weren't the two of you friends?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 114.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' You wouldn't understand &mdash; friendship between gentlemen is as pure as water. We are all dignified people, why bother with such trivial matters?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So more like a drinking buddy than a friend...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg wallosh 115.ogg}} '''Wallace:''' What a preposterous statement! You wouldn't understand &mdash; friendship between gentlemen is as pure as water. We are all dignified people, why bother with such trivial matters?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 339.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Ugh... In the eyes of most people, there's a world of difference between "trivial matters" and a career.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 340.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...I have recorded all the clues you provided, Mr. Limestein. Thank you for putting your trust in the Silvermane Guards. We will keep you informed if there are any developments in the investigation.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can remember all of that!?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg bronya 116.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' The leader of a city should be familiar with the status and division of labor of her subordinates &mdash; that's just part of the job. Norbert's position is indeed an idle one, so it's no wonder he has time to socialize with members of the Limestein family.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg soldierKale 104.ogg}} '''Soldier Kyle:''' They say that Mr. Norbert was indeed leaving at odd hours recently. Whenever someone would ask where he was headed, he'd mumble something about going to the shopping street to "inspect the site."

:{{A|VO side1 bwg bronya 124.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' While the two of you were busy questioning people in the city, I received some tip-offs.
