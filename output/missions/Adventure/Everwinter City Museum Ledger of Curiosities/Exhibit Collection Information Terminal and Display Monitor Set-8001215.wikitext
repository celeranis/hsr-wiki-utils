:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), we just stumbled across a treasure map while going through the collection.
::'''Uldan:''' It's not tremendously old, but it sure looks aged enough. I'm guessing that we might be able to find something of value from here to display.
::'''Uldan:''' Looks like these treasures are all in the Underworld... (Trailblazer), can I please task you with finding them?
