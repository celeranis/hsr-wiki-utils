;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), we just stumbled across a treasure map while going through the collection.
::'''Uldan:''' It's not tremendously old, but it sure looks aged enough. I'm guessing that we might be able to find something of value from here to display.
::'''Uldan:''' Looks like these treasures are all in the Underworld... (Trailblazer), can I please task you with finding them?

::'''Uldan:''' Welcome to the Belobog History and Culture Museum, {{MC|f=young miss|m=young man}}. Is there anything an old man like me can help you with?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just here to visit the museum.
:::'''Uldan:''' Oh hoho, you're at the wrong place. This is the museum's warehouse. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here solely to talk with older people.
:::'''Uldan:''' Hah, what a unique hobby. However, this is a museum after all. Since you're here, might as well have a tour. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::'''Uldan:''' If you have any questions along your tour, or if you have any feedback or opinions, welcome to come talk to me...
::'''Uldan:''' ...I am Uldan, former dean of the Belobog College of Art, and now the curator of this museum. Pleased to meet you.
