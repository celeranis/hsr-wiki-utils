;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' You again, (Trailblazer). You're just in time: The {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|museum workshop}} has just received a batch of artifacts that need restoring.
::'''Uldan:''' Give them a hand if you're free. Head over and talk to {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Boris}} &mdash; it's his area of expertise, and he'll fill you in with exactly what needs to be done.

:::{{DIcon|?}} About the portrait of Cyrille the Fool...
::::'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer)... Did you say that the description of {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cyrille the Fool's}} portrait deviated from the truth?
::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Still, I can tell you have at least heard of Cyrille from your tone.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have evidence that supports Cyrille.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Since you sound so sure of yourself, I'll take a look at your evidence.
