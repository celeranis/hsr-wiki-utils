:::{{DIcon|?}} About the portrait of Cyrille the Fool...
::::'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer)... Did you say that the description of {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cyrille the Fool's}} portrait deviated from the truth?
::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Still, I can tell you have at least heard of Cyrille from your tone.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have evidence that supports Cyrille.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Since you sound so sure of yourself, I'll take a look at your evidence.
