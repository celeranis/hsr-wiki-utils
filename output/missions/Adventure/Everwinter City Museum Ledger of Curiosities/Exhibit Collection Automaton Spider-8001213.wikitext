;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), you're back. I have absolute confidence that you're the right person for this next job.
::'''Uldan:''' This time around, I hope you can help us retrieve some data from {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Spider}}...
::'''Uldan:''' This is a simple job: Just take this recording device down to the Underworld and get into a fight with an {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Spider}} &mdash; that's all.
::'''Uldan:''' Automaton data from the Underworld presumably is not classified... And so, I leave this task in your capable hands.
