;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), you're back. I have absolute confidence that you're the right person for this next job.
::'''Uldan:''' This time around, I hope you can help us retrieve some data from {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Spider}}...
::'''Uldan:''' This is a simple job: Just take this recording device down to the Underworld and get into a fight with an {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Spider}} &mdash; that's all.
::'''Uldan:''' Automaton data from the Underworld presumably is not classified... And so, I leave this task in your capable hands.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just here to visit the museum.
:::'''Uldan:''' Oh hoho, you're at the wrong place. This is the museum's warehouse. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here solely to talk with older people.
:::'''Uldan:''' Hah, what a unique hobby. However, this is a museum after all. Since you're here, might as well have a tour. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::'''Uldan:''' If you have any questions along your tour, or if you have any feedback or opinions, welcome to come talk to me...
::'''Uldan:''' ...I am Uldan, former dean of the Belobog College of Art, and now the curator of this museum. Pleased to meet you.
