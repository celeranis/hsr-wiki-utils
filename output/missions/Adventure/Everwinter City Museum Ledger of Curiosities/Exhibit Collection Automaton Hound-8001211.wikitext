;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), you're back. I have absolute confidence that you're the right person for this next job.
::'''Uldan:''' This time around, I hope you can help us retrieve some data from {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Hound}}...
::'''Uldan:''' We put in a request with the Silvermane Guards' Technology Division, but they shut us down. They said that data from Silvermane automatons is top secret, so they're unwilling to let it be an exhibit in the Museum.
::'''Uldan:''' That's why I've thought of you &mdash; I heard you've made quite the name for yourself down in the Underworld, and even that Svarog is willing to sing your praises...
::'''Uldan:''' This is a simple job: Just take this recording device down to the Underworld and get into a fight with an {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Hound}} &mdash; that's all.
::'''Uldan:''' Automaton data from the Underworld presumably is not classified... And so, I leave this task in your capable hands.

::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
:::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.

:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' Huh? A fresh face. What have you come to our robot settlement for?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want some data from an automaton hound.
:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' Yeah, right. That's a pretty tall order! No way I'm handing over automaton data to just anybody.
:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' But then again, if you're willing to spar with my big baby, then I might just be willin' to reconsider.
:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' How about it, then? A fight? Or are you scared of my baby?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's fight, then! Bring it on!

:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' Haha, now that's some precious data. Don't worry, my dear &mdash; I'll give you an upgrade...
:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' So here's the previous automaton data for you. I ain't got no use for it anymore.
:'''"Mech-Pet" Lover:''' You earned it &mdash; seeya later, {{MC|f=sister|m=brother}}!
