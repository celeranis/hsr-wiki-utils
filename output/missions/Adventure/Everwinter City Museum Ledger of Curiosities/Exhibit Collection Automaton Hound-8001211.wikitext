;(Talk to Uldan)
:'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer), you're back. I have absolute confidence that you're the right person for this next job.
::'''Uldan:''' This time around, I hope you can help us retrieve some data from {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Hound}}...
::'''Uldan:''' We put in a request with the Silvermane Guards' Technology Division, but they shut us down. They said that data from Silvermane automatons is top secret, so they're unwilling to let it be an exhibit in the Museum.
::'''Uldan:''' That's why I've thought of you &mdash; I heard you've made quite the name for yourself down in the Underworld, and even that Svarog is willing to sing your praises...
::'''Uldan:''' This is a simple job: Just take this recording device down to the Underworld and get into a fight with an {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Automaton Hound}} &mdash; that's all.
::'''Uldan:''' Automaton data from the Underworld presumably is not classified... And so, I leave this task in your capable hands.
