;(Talk to Pela)
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 190 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 190 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Good to see you, (Trailblazer). The General Hall has been receiving a lot of visitors lately. The yearning for history and art has reawakened in the hearts of Belobogians &mdash; thanks to your superb management!
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 191.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Y'know, I never guessed you'd become a pro at this job &mdash; I only wanted you to experience the fun of working here...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 192 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 192 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So I'm curious, how do you like being the museum manager, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love it &mdash; loads of fun.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 193.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I know, right? And it really gives you a sense of accomplishment.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who doesn't like easy money?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 194.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So that's what you like about it... *sigh* I guess most people probably think the same way.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It has its ups and downs.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 195.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I see... But at least you have a sense of accomplishment, right? Otherwise, you wouldn't still be doing it.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 196.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Anyway, there's something else I wanted to talk to you about &mdash; there's been a new development in the museum theft case.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 197 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 197 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' First, I need to show you something. Here, (Trailblazer), this way.

===Head to the Industrial Hall{{subst:void|<!--201190202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=History and Culture Museum|update|Pela was satisfied with the results you achieved while operating the museum.<br />She wants to open up the Industrial Exhibit next, but a key exhibit in this area was stolen. Go and see what the situation is.}}

:<!--1-second delay-->
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 198.ogg}} '''Pela:''' After the General Hall opened to the public, the Silvermane Guards and Wildfire did a follow-up investigation in the Underworld.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 199.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Progress was really slow, but they managed to hunt down some new clues.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 200.ogg}} '''Pela:''' If the next stage of the investigation is successful, we should be able to open up the Industrial Hall to the public.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 201.ogg}} '''Pela:''' And here we are.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 202.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The item that's supposed to be in this exhibit is a modern sculpture called Gears and Wisdom.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 203.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It's a little hard to describe &mdash; sort of... abstract. It's made up of gears and mechanical parts, and it's about the same height and weight as the average person... Basically, it's too heavy for someone to just pick up and run off with.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 204.ogg}} '''Pela:''' As you can see, this sculpture was placed at the entrance of the Industrial Hall because it symbolizes the industrial spirit that Belobogians have lived, breathed and produced for centuries.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 205.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Without it, the Industrial Hall loses its soul... We have to retrieve the sculpture before we can open to the public.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where should we look?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 206.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It seems like we'll have to make another visit to the Underworld.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 207.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It took nearly twenty years from design to completion to make Gears and Wisdom... We can't let all that painstaking work and talent go to waste. We have to get it back.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe we could make a new one?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 208.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Let me ask you something &mdash; do you know how long it took to make Gears and Wisdom from initial design to completion?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 209.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Twenty years! We can't let all that painstaking work and talent go to waste.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 210.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I received some intel just earlier today. Someone said they found clues related to a gang of thieves in the Underworld's Robot Settlement. I don't know if they'll lead us to the sculpture, but it's worth a try.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 211 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 211 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' We can head over to the Robot Settlement as soon as you're ready, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Time to go get that sculpture.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 223.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Nice to see you, Clara. What brings you to the Robot Settlement?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 102.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Well, something strange happened in the settlement recently. I'm asking the grownups who live nearby if they know anything about it.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 224.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Something strange? Can you share any details?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 103.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Well, recently... a lot of the little robots in the settlement started behaving strangely. It's like they malfunctioned suddenly, all at the same time.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 104.ogg}} '''Clara:''' They started roaming around, breaking into people's tents, destroying their belongings... It was a real headache for the people living here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did Svarog say?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 105.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog scanned the robots for irregularities, but the results all came back normal.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Never a quiet day in the Underworld...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 106.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yeah, I guess...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 107.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog scanned the robots for irregularities, but the results all came back normal.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 108.ogg}} '''Clara:''' So... I don't think it's a hardware issue.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 225.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So they're malfunctioning collectively. Hmm...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like they could use our help.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 226.ogg}} '''Pela:''' *sigh* You're right. Since we're already here...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This doesn't have anything to do with our investigation.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 227.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Mm... You're right, it probably doesn't...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 228.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...but since we're already here, they could use our help.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 229.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Clara, we'll help you investigate what's going on with the robots.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 109 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg clara 109 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Really? But don't you and Miss Pela have something important to do?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 230.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It'll be fine &mdash; we have other people in the Underworld working on the investigation too. Besides, we don't have any clues yet, so we may as well do something useful.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 110.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Ah... thanks a lot! I was worried about handling the robots on my own... but with your help, it should be easy!
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 231.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The duty of the Silvermane Guards is to serve the people. So, where can we find these robots? Clara, can you lead the way?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 111.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Of course! Just follow me.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 101 f.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Clara, you have returned. And you have brought with you the outsider, (Trailblazer), and...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 102.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Querying database... Silvermane Guard Intelligence Officer Pelageya Sergeyevna. It is a pleasure to meet you.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 261.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...It's nice to meet you, Mr. Svarog.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childE 101.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Boy:''' Hey, big sis Clara is back!
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childF 101.ogg}} '''Introverted Girl:''' Big sis Clara...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 132.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hello! What brings you two here today?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 103.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' These two young humans found a suspicious batch of components. They wished to deliver them to me and earn my "appreciation." However, the origin of these components is unknown and they have no practical utility. It is difficult to ascertain their value...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 262.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Suspicious components? Can we have a look at them?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 104.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' As you wish.
:You and Pela check out the parts collected by the children.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 263.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Sure enough! These parts are from the museum's sculpture!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where did you guys find the parts?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 264.ogg}} '''Pela:''' These kids found way more than we did fixing all those robots... what an embarrassment...
::They found way more parts than we did...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They found way more parts than we did...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 265.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Yep, we were outdone by a couple of kids. Kind of embarrassing when you think about it...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childE 102.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Boy:''' Me and my sister were playing outside &mdash; we heard some grownups talking about what they were going to do with the parts.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childE 103.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Boy:''' It seemed suspicious... They were acting all sneaky!
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childE 104.ogg}} '''Enthusiastic Boy:''' We hid in the shadows and waited until we heard them snoring...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childF 102.ogg}} '''Introverted Girl:''' And then, and then &mdash; we quietly dragged away the boxes with the parts in, a&mdash;and gave them to Mr. Svarog...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 266.ogg}} '''Pela:''' That was really risky behavior! If those grownups had woken up, things could have gotten really dangerous for you two.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg childF 103.ogg}} '''Introverted Girl:''' *whimper* W&mdash;We were just trying to help...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 267.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Oh, don't cry! Uh &mdash; listen, these parts don't belong to Mr. Svarog, but... you two were still a big help to us!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Quick, Svarog, say something nice!
::{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 105 f.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' I am unable to determine the logic behind this series of events, but if you insist...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 106.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' ...excellent job, little girl.
::Yes, you two are real lifesavers!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, you two are real lifesavers!

:{{A|VO side1 bwg clara 133.ogg}} '''Clara:''' See, I told you Mr. Svarog had warmed up to guests.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've gotten better at getting along with humans.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 110.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Did you arrive at such a conclusion through direct observation?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 111.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Clara too has conveyed similar sentiments, though my emotional indices have not experienced any fluctuations.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 112.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' If you and Clara have both reached the same conclusion independently, then there must be some force influencing my behavior which transcends my system's algorithms.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg svarog 113.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' This possibility strikes me as peculiar... but not necessarily bad.
