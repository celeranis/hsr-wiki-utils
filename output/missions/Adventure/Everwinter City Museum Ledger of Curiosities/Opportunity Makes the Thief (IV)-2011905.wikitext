===Speak with Pela in the museum{{subst:void|<!--201190501-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=History and Culture Museum|You finished one phase of the museum's operations.<br />You seem to see Pela again in the exhibit hall. Perhaps there are some results from Norbert's interrogation? Go speak with her.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Pela)
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 397 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 397 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' (Trailblazer), nice to see you. You're looking in good spirits.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 398.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The museum is packed these days &mdash; I've never seen it so full of visitors. You run a tight ship here.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 399.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Still, it'd be nice if those kids would stop littering... It's barely lunchtime and I've already picked up three half-eaten packs of snow-white popping candy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there something you wanted to talk about, Pela?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 400.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Ah, don't worry, nothing was stolen this time.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 401.ogg}} '''Pela:''' You remember that Norbert guy we captured? The Silvermane Guards have acquired new intel from him &mdash; I thought you might find it interesting.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Kids these days...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 402.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I know, right? I'll teach them a lesson myself if I catch them in the act, that's for sure.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 403.ogg}} '''Pela:''' By the way, you remember that Norbert guy we captured? The Silvermane Guards have acquired new intel from him &mdash; I thought you might find it interesting.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 404.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I always wondered &mdash; how did he, a rich kid with virtually no real life experience, suddenly think of becoming a smuggler?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 405.ogg}} '''Pela:''' There's no way someone like him could've come up with the idea of disassembling a sculpture and hiding the pieces inside robots.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 406.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The result is just as I expected... After less than half a day of interrogation, he confessed everything.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 407.ogg}} '''Pela:''' He admitted that a mysterious figure named {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Mr. Cold Feet}} persuaded him to target the museum exhibits.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 408.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Mr. Cold Feet fooled Norbert into believing that many of the museum's artifacts were forcibly seized from private collectors by the Silvermane Guards. He told him that true justice would be returning the artifacts to the people...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 409.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Norbert probably didn't believe any of that nonsense &mdash; I think he just wanted to prove himself and add more to his fortune.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 410.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Mr. Cold Feet not only introduced him to buyers, but also gave him advice, and only charged him a 30% consultant's fee... In the opinion of our young Mr. Norbert, the deal was too good to refuse.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you find this Mr. Cold Feet?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 411 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 411 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Ahem. That's what I wanted to discuss with you, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds lucrative. Why didn't he recruit me...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 412.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Ahem. I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 413 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 413 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So, (Trailblazer), I came to discuss with you about this Mr. Cold Feet.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 414.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Norbert said Mr. Cold feet operates with extreme discretion, and knows the Silvermane Guards' every move like the back of his hand. If he catches wind about the slightest rumor in the city, he'll disappear without a trace.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 415.ogg}} '''Pela:''' If what Mr. Norbert said is true, then our safest option is to send a civilian to try to reach out to Mr. Cold Feet and lure him out of his lair.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to go and meet him?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 416.ogg}} '''Pela:''' You guessed it! Everyone agrees that there is no better candidate than you.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 417.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Norbert said he usually communicates with Mr. Cold Feet {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|through the door of a room in the Goethe Hotel}}. The usual agreed meeting time is... right now.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 418 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 418 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' (Trailblazer), take this as a final request from the Silvermane Guards &mdash; can you go to the Goethe Hotel to meet with this Mr. Cold Feet?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Head to the Hotel Corridor of the Goethe Hotel{{subst:void|<!--201190502-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Hotel Corridor|update|The truth is that Norbert was spurred on by a mysterious person with the code name "Mr. Cold Feet."

::{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 133.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' "...Guessed?" So, you don't have any evidence...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 134.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' ...Eh-he. Well, I mean... how could you! Your old buddy Sampo is a model citizen, these days. Y'know the guards on sentry duty in the restricted zone? I deliver their breakfast every day, hehe...

:{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 137.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Okay, okay, I have a proposal &mdash; I'm sure you'll find this very reasonable. Yeah, I made a few small fortunes in the artifact business lately... and I can give you a third of my earnings. How about that, huh?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 138.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' In exchange, I only ask that you please don't tell the Silvermane Guards about me... Just tell them you missed the culprit. You're a big hero &mdash; they won't give you a hard time about it, right?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 139.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' How's that sound? One-third is a lot of money &mdash; think about it! I would never dare to rip off a valued client such as yourself!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Reject) You think I can be bought?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 140 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg sampo 140 f.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' I... I mean... H&mdash;How can you be so unaccommodating? That is not like you, (Trailblazer)!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Accept) Okay, it's a deal.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 429.ogg}} '''Pela:''' He knows how to keep his identity hidden, and his sources are fast and reliable... I guess he found out about Mr. Norbert's arrest and made a run for it.
