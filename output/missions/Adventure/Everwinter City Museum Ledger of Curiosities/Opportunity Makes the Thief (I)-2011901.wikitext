;(Talk to Pela)
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 101 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Hey, it's you, (Trailblazer)! I didn't expect to see you here in the Administrative District. How have you been lately?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pretty good. How about you?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 102.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Great to hear! Since the Stellaron crisis subsided, Belobog's been feeling a little more cheerful. We're really grateful for your assistance...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 103.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...and yes, things are going well for me too &mdash; thanks for asking!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Things could be better.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 104.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Oh... Don't worry, things will get better &mdash; I'm sure of it.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 105.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Speaking of things getting better, Belobog's been feeling a little more cheerful since the Stellaron crisis subsided. We couldn't have done it without you.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 106.ogg}} '''Pela:''' You spent so much time in Belobog on your last visit &mdash; you must have passed by here before, right?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 107.ogg}} '''Pela:''' This is Belobog's History and Culture Museum &mdash; built more than six hundred years ago.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 108.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Last time you visited, it was closed for its ten-year renovation.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 109.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Now that the Stellaron crisis is over, we've been able to allocate more manpower to the renovation works. The museum should be open to the public again soon.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 110.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It's just...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just what?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...You ran into trouble?
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 111.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...We encountered a problem during the renovation process. The Silvermane Guards are doing all they can to figure it out.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 112 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 112 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I... *sigh* Sorry, (Trailblazer), I shouldn't talk about it in the open like this. Hey – why don't I give you a tour of the museum? We can talk inside while I show you around...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 113.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...if you have time, that is.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That sounds nice.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 114.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Great! What are we waiting for?

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=History and Culture Museum|update|Pela mentioned that the Belobog History and Culture Museum, currently being renovated, is facing some problems.<br />Visit the museum with her to understand the issues at hand.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 120.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Past the Reception Hall, you'll find the General Hall &mdash; the museum's largest exhibition room.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 121.ogg}} '''Pela:''' There are all sorts of exhibits on display – paintings by famous artists, samples of the planet's crust... Visitors can experience the essence of Belobog's culture in just a few minutes' time.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 122.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I really hope the museum can open up soon... The children here need a culturally-enriching environment &mdash; especially those from the Underworld...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 123.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...but like I mentioned earlier, we're in a bit of a bind &mdash; we could really use a helping hand.

:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 124.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Here – this is the issue we're trying to deal with.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The exhibit disappeared?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 125.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It was stolen.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's a thief on the prowl?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 126.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Wow, you're quick! Yes, this exhibit was stolen just recently.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you need help opening this cabinet...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 127.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Wait! What are you doing!?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 128.ogg}} '''Pela:''' *sigh* You're in a museum, remember!? Here, let me explain – this exhibit was recently stolen.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 129.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It was one of the oldest and most precious items in the General Hall collection &mdash; the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Meteor Fragment}}.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 130.ogg}} '''Pela:''' It is said that seven hundred years ago, the invaders from beyond the sky descended upon the surface of Jarilo-VI with a meteor shower. The Meteor Fragment is solid evidence that those invaders once tainted our land...
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 131.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Ahem, sorry, the tour guide in me gets a little carried away &mdash; I'm not here to give you a history lesson. Still, it's no exaggeration to say that if the Meteor Fragment isn't recovered, the museum will lose half of its significance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know who the thief is?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 132.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Not yet. That's why this case is such a conundrum for the Silvermane Guards.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't we just use a replica?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 133.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Out of the question! As the curator of the exhibits here, I would never resort to deceiving the public like that...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 134.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Our first priority is finding the thief and recovering the stolen item, but we don't even have a suspect yet... That's why this case is such a conundrum for the Silvermane Guards.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 135.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Truth be told, the Meteor Fragment isn't the only item that was stolen... but we want the museum to open as soon as possible. We can worry about the other missing items later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Any leads?
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 136.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Of course &mdash; I wouldn't ask you to start a whole investigation from scratch.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I know who the culprit is.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 137.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Ah, you must be thinking of Sampo, right? I don't think so, our people have been keeping a close eye on him these days. The reports say he's been on his best behavior – not the slightest hint of trouble-making.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 138.ogg}} '''Pela:''' The guards stationed in the Underworld reported that some suspicious characters have been meeting at {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a hideout in the Great Mine}} late at night.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 139.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Since the Silvermane Guards are still getting situated in the Underworld and we don't have any direct evidence, we haven't been able to apprehend any suspects.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 140.ogg}} '''Pela:''' But if you were to go there yourself and ask around... I think we could gather a lot of useful intel.
:{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 141 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 bwg pela 141 f.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So, (Trailblazer), would you like to help solve this case?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd love to.
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 142.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Excellent! Just as I expected &mdash; short, sweet, and decisive. To the Underworld it is, then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's meet at the Great Mine and go from there...
::{{A|VO side1 bwg pela 143.ogg}} '''Pela:''' ...Sound promising! I'll meet you in the Underworld, then.
