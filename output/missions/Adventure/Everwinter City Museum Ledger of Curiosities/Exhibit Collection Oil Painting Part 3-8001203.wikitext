::'''Uldan:''' Oh yes, that's right &mdash; don't forget the fee. Here you go. Pass it on to Rebini.

;(Talk to Rebini)
:'''Rebini:''' I'm out of tune and my throat is hoarse &mdash;
:'''Rebini:''' But at least &mdash; nobody can harmonize with me &mdash;!
:'''Rebini:''' Oh, hello there, citizen!
:'''Rebini:''' Huh, something seems really familiar about you... I must be wrong, though.
:'''Rebini:''' I'm sorry. As you can see &mdash; I'm definitely painting here, but I'm no art dealer. If you want to buy something, I'm afraid you'll have to try elsewhere.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What I want to buy is one of your paintings.
::'''Rebini:''' Ahem, no way. This artwork here has been commissioned by the Belobog History and Culture Museum...
::'''Rebini:''' ...It's a commission, get it? That means so long as you pay enough, it can be YOUR commission.
::'''Rebini:''' As for the price of this one &mdash; 12,000 credits will do. You should pump it up a little if you're really sincere about things...
::'''Rebini:''' ...Otherwise, why would I terminate my contract with the museum, right? Haha!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's too much. I want it cheaper!
:::'''Rebini:''' Ha! What's wrong with you? There's no such thing as a free lunch out there!
:::'''Rebini:''' If you do that, then I'll have to keep putting up the price &mdash; it's 14,000 credits now. Take it or leave it!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine by me!
:::'''Rebini:''' Not bad. You really are a breath of fresh air!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} To be honest... Uldan sent me.
:::'''Rebini:''' ...Tsk! That old man again.
:::'''Rebini:''' Ack, fine then. In any case, the painting's finished &mdash; hand over the payment, and you can leave with his painting.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, Uldan sent me to chase you up.
::'''Rebini:''' ...Tsk! That old man again.
::'''Rebini:''' Ack, fine then. In any case, the painting's finished &mdash; hand over the payment, and you can leave with his painting.
