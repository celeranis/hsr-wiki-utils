:'''Guinaifen:''' Is it really that strange for someone to have a strong burst of ambition after being lazy for a long time?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's extremely strange!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Huh!?
::You don't think so?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't think so?
:'''Guinaifen:''' You're right, I have times when I suddenly feel inspired to work really hard, too.
:'''Sushang:''' It's common for outworlders like you, Little Gui, to want to work hard and upgrade your flat for a mansion or your starskiff for a giant ship. After all, your youth is limited and the pressure to survive is great.
:'''Sushang:''' But for a long-life society like ours... Things are different. The majority of people only seek a secure life.
:'''Sushang:''' But, people think in all kinds of wonderful ways, who can really say for sure?
:'''Huohuo:''' What do you think, Mr. Tail?
:'''Tail:''' Hehe, the idea that anything that does not align with common logic must be the work of some unseen ghost is a very primitive way of thinking.
:'''Tail:''' However, if someone's personality undergoes a dramatic change without them doing anything, that could indeed be the work of a heliobus.
:'''Huohuo:''' ...That really doesn't help us at all.
:'''Tail:''' I'm not the person at the center of the Angler Mystery, how can I give an answer if I've not been to the scene personally?
:'''Huohuo:''' Even though the person that posted this didn't say what department they were from, judging by the name, there's no doubt that they're from the Divination Commission, right?
:'''Guinaifen:''' ...Is it really a heliobus causing this?
:'''Huohuo:''' (Trailblazer), why don't we go and take a look together, to be on the safe side?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay, let's go!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've just got some things to deal with first...
:'''Huohuo:''' Okay, I'll contact the person who made the post at the Divination Commission and wait for you there.

:'''Fu Xuan:''' Ah, it's you! You really do work hard. I see posting on the "Ghostly Grove" page really gets things done, though!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You again?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' There has been a lot of trouble in the Divination Commission lately, ever since&mdash;
::Fu Xuan suddenly lowered her voice and became almost too quiet to hear.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' ...Since that time the heliobi greatly damaged my reputation, another strange phenomenon has occurred in our department.
::Why didn't you just message us directly?
::'''Huohuo:''' That's right, master diviner. If you suspect there are still heliobi that have not been cleared out from the Divination Commission, you can just contact us directly.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' I am not yet entirely convinced that "this is undoubtedly the work of a heliobus," so I thought I'd make the post to investigate...
::'''Fu Xuan:''' As you're here, that means there is indeed something suspicious about this.
::Seeing you now, I know exactly who your post is referring to.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seeing you now, I know exactly who your post is referring to.
:'''Fu Xuan:''' That's right, you understand. This may not seem so strange to the average person, but everyone in our department finds this whole thing extremely abnormal.
:'''Fu Xuan:''' Ahem, how should I explain? When you were all assisting me in driving out the lingering heliobi, our diviner Qingque made a great contribution to the efforts. I wanted to thank her and give her more opportunities to show her skills in the department...
:'''Fu Xuan:''' But for some unknown reason, her attitude completely changed recently. She has been the first into the office and the last to leave. Today I even received notice from other diviners that she is planning to quit her role as diviner and is encouraging her colleagues to start a new business with her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's so strange!
::'''Fu Xuan:''' You see? I'm sure you understand.
::Is it that strange to want to start a business and get rich?
::'''Fu Xuan:''' It is not. People are creatures of desire, it is normal for them to crave renown and fortune.
::'''Fu Xuan:''' But I have spoken with Qingque before, she only came to work for the Divination Commission for stability and comfort... It is extremely hard to imagine that a person like this would suddenly want to try starting a business.
::Do you not like Qingque now that she is a motivated worker?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you not like Qingque now that she is a motivated worker?
:'''Fu Xuan:''' People are naturally diligent or lazy, I do not judge anyone for either. However, when someone's personality suddenly transforms, it is often because of an external influence.
:'''Fu Xuan:''' I think there is something extremely eerie about this whole thing. Thinking back to my own encounter, I wanted to ask you to take a look for yourselves.
