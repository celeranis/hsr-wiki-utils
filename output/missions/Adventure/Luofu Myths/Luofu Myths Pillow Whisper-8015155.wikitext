{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Fyxestroll Garden|You and your fellow ghost-hunters browse Ghostly Grove, discussing which rumors and anomalies might be caused by heliobi. Accurately distinguishing them requires 99 percent common sense and one percent intuition &mdash; some call it intuition, some call it psychic powers.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Divination Commission|update|You arrive at the Divination Commission and meet the one who made the post asking for help, and it is none other than master diviner. She expresses her concerns about the changes occurring in Qingque. Apparently, she has been working diligently, clocking in right on time and leaving not a minute early, and meticulously planning for an (apparently) amazing business plan.}}

You're her friend, yet she hasn't even reached out to you? That doesn't seem like something a friend would do. You decide to listen to her entrepreneurial speech.}}

However, you &mdash; or rather, Huohuo and Tail &mdash; have detected a trace of a heliobus' tricks. Your team ring the "Harmonic Chime" and dive deep into the illusion trapping Qingque.}}
