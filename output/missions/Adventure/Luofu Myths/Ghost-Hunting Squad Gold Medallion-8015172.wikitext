::{{DIcon|Arrow}} *sigh* Just tell them here and now.

:'''Guinaifen:''' I'll keep it quick: A cycrane just delivered us a package. Opening it up, I saw...
::'''Sushang:''' Another silver medallion!
::'''Huohuo:''' They wouldn't send out another one of those things, would they?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Nope, it's a gee-oh-el-dee GOLD medallion &mdash; for getting to one million subs!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Congratulations are in order!
:::'''Guinaifen:''' Thank you so much.
:::The legendary gold medallion! That must be precious.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The legendary gold medallion! That must be precious.
::'''Guinaifen:''' As far as I'm aware, there's no higher medallion on offer. So yes, it's indeed quite precious.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Thank you so much to everyone who helped us get our silver medallion. It seems like just yesterday... but now we've already smashed through the million subs mark &mdash; and of course, it's all thanks to everyone's support, too.
::'''Guinaifen:''' We'll have to eat, drink, and make merry of course in celebration &mdash; but... I think what's more important right now is that we acknowledge how hard it's been for the four of us to make this team and put together such outstanding results.
::'''Guinaifen:''' I think, we should at least commemorate the occasion somehow, such as a celebration live stream or something else. What do you think?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of commemoration were you thinking?
:::'''Guinaifen:''' Shooting a vlog, and then taking some group photos or whatever.
:::I'm down for anything. Up to you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm down for anything. Up to you.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Don't worry. I've been waiting for just this moment.
::'''Guinaifen:''' I want to revisit everywhere I've vlogged before, but together with you guys too... Then, I'll mix and splice that into scenes from those old streams. I think... it'll be really interesting, and also really memorable.
