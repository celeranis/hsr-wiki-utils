;(Talk to Yukong)
:'''Yukong:''' It's you, (Trailblazer). Thanks for your help with the phantom starskiff this time. Please help me thank the ghost-hunting squad as well.
:'''Qingni:''' I would like to thank you and your team too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're welcome. That's our job.
::'''Yukong:''' Understood. Thank you for your hard work.
::Don't mention it. We're just completing a job for the Ten-Lords Commission.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't mention it. We're just completing a job for the Ten-Lords Commission.
:'''Yukong:''' You always have a strange way of being humble.
:'''Qingni:''' ...So why did you forbid Sky-Faring Commission staff from talking about the phantom starskiff?

:'''Qingni:''' Look, this is the real phantom starskiff's... projection.
:'''Yukong:''' Ack, all for nothing.
:'''Qingni:''' The foxian ceremony will place items of the dead onto the starskiff, sending them out of Xianzhou and into the stars to shine brilliantly among them.
:'''Qingni:''' ...But in fact, we are hoping the dead will board the starskiff and return home, no?
:'''Qingni:''' I had a discussion with our colleagues in the Sky-Faring Commission, and we decided to place a projection of the starskiff at Foxsomn Tomb, so everyone who comes to mourn will have something to pin their hopes on. Mother, take a look at this. What do you think?
:'''Yukong:''' Well done. We'll keep it docked at Foxsomn Tomb.
