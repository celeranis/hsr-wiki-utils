===Speak to Sushang and Guinaifen{{subst:void|<!--801515801-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Haunted House|The ghost-hunting squad obtained the permission to investigate the haunted residence in order to help the landlord recover the deed. Speak with Guinaifen and Sushang on how you should go about investigating the haunted residence.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sushang:''' This... Isn't this place exactly the same as the "heliobus labyrinth" that we encountered before? So creepy...
:'''Guinaifen:''' Ah, there is limited resource on the Xianzhou Luofu, I just had to piece things together with a blueprint of a similar house.
:'''Sushang:''' ...That must be the haunted house up ahead.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So we're staying here tonight? Good night!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Wait. I'm not stupid enough to spend the night in a haunted house!
::I thought we would be able to look around inside...
::'''Guinaifen:''' The owner said that when he was moving out, the house was cleared out and locked shut. The deed should be in a safe somewhere.
::This isn't as scary as I imagined...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought we would be able to look around inside...
::'''Guinaifen:''' The owner said that when he was moving out, the house was cleared out and locked shut. The deed should be in a safe somewhere.
::This isn't as scary as I imagined...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This isn't as scary as I imagined...
:'''Guinaifen:''' ...This is a Luofu model house. How scary can it be?
:'''Guinaifen:''' Either way, we need to find the deed and investigate the truth behind this heliobus while we're at it. Two birds, one stone. Then, we'll put up a "haunted house investigation" post and rake in the followers!
:'''Sushang:''' You make it all sound so easy! I'm a little concerned... Come to think of it, don't you think that advertisement board over there is a little out of place?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this something that should be in a civilian home?
::'''Guinaifen:''' ...Nope.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} See what we can find out...
::'''Guinaifen:''' ...No time to waste. Let's go now.

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:An advertisement board that looks a little out of place. No one would have something like this in their house.
:(Investigate closely)
:Woah, there's a wanted poster for Kafka!
:Given that some time passed since the "Ambrosial Arbor" incident, the Luofu should have already removed the wanted notice for the Stellaron Hunters. However, grassroots-level work can be slow, and you may still see Kafka's wanted poster on the streets.
:However, a wanted poster for Kafka appearing here, in the courtyard of an apparent haunted house, should raise some caution among you and your companions due to its unexpected nature.
:It shouldn't be here. You should probably get closer and take a look.
:Just as you move closer to inspect, the advertisement board suddenly flips over, like it's come to life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Touch it)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Get closer)
:Who would have expected this?
:...Your first thought right now is...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This must be a clue about the haunted house!
::That's right.
::Cool! Are there any more?
::Sorry, not enough have been produced.
::What about a wanted poster for Blade?
::No way!
::I want to tear it down!
::...Stop.
::She is beautiful.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cool! Are there any more?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She is beautiful.
:Correct, but now is not the time to be saying such things.
:*Crash*
:A strangely-colored stone falls down before your eyes, as if someone has noticed you looking at the wanted poster.
:There is no one around. Just where did this come from? As you pick it up, you realize that this is probably an important clue.
:At that moment, you hear a ghostly voice coming from behind you, like an echo that directly imprints into your brain.
:'''Some Kind of Ruffling Sound:''' ...Save... Me...
:'''Some Kind of Ruffling Sound:''' ...It's... so dark. I... I don't want to be trapped here...
:'''Some Kind of Ruffling Sound:''' Please find me... This magnetic stone... Is the first clue...
:'''Some Kind of Ruffling Sound:''' Bring it... Come and find me... Come and... save me...
:The weakened voice comes to an abrupt halt.
:'''Guinaifen:''' ...Did you hear that? It was a vengeful spirit!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought only I could hear it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I heard it. I suddenly don't really want to rescue them.
:'''Sushang:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean by a vengeful spirit? That was obviously a heliobus, right?

::From what you know of Sushang, she is a good young girl, but she struggles with studies. By this logic, it makes sense that a brainteaser like this would bring her to her wit's end.
::But, there is a phrase on the Xianzhou: "Enough random punches can kill a grandmaster," meaning sometimes it is possible to win through pure chaos that defies normal logic. Perhaps this is the "ace up her sleeve."
::Well, will you ask Sushang?

:::'''Sushang:''' Ah, I get it, you want me to have a try! Alright... let's give it a shot!
:::'''Sushang:''' These... Strange characters, I have no idea what they mean. However, looking at their shapes, "M" is 71839 if we're going by single strokes, "N" is 7193, and "V" is 183...
:::'''Sushang:''' Then, "T"... That doesn't seem like it can be written with one stroke.
:::'''Sushang:''' Then I guess we'll use two. 1, 3, 2, 8.
:::'''Sushang:''' Ah, it opened!
:::'''Guinaifen:''' Seriously? The password is the stroke order for "T" on a nine-square grid?
