===Speak to Sushang and Guinaifen{{subst:void|<!--801515801-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Haunted House|The ghost-hunting squad obtained the permission to investigate the haunted residence in order to help the landlord recover the deed. Speak with Guinaifen and Sushang on how you should go about investigating the haunted residence.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sushang:''' This... Isn't this place exactly the same as the "heliobus labyrinth" that we encountered before? So creepy...
:'''Guinaifen:''' Ah, there is limited resource on the Xianzhou Luofu, I just had to piece things together with a blueprint of a similar house.
:'''Sushang:''' ...That must be the haunted house up ahead.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So we're staying here tonight? Good night!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Wait. I'm not stupid enough to spend the night in a haunted house!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought we would be able to look around inside...
::'''Guinaifen:''' The owner said that when he was moving out, the house was cleared out and locked shut. The deed should be in a safe somewhere.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This isn't as scary as I imagined...
::'''Guinaifen:''' ...This is a Luofu model house. How scary can it be?
:'''Guinaifen:''' Either way, we need to find the deed and investigate the truth behind this heliobus while we're at it. Two birds, one stone. Then, we'll put up a "haunted house investigation" post and rake in the followers!
:'''Sushang:''' You make it all sound so easy! I'm a little concerned... Come to think of it, don't you think that advertisement board over there is a little out of place?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this something that should be in a civilian home?
::'''Guinaifen:''' ...Nope.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} See what we can find out...
::'''Guinaifen:''' ...No time to waste. Let's go now.

===Investigate the odd billboard{{subst:void|<!--801515803-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Haunted House|update|There will always be unexpected items appearing in haunted residences, such as billboards with their backs to the front. Perhaps the journey to penetrate into the depths of the haunted residence should start here.}}

:An advertisement board that looks a little out of place. No one would have something like this in their house.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Investigate closely)

===Investigate the abnormally posted wanted poster{{subst:void|<!--801515804-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Haunted House|update|Sure, Kafka's wanted poster is pretty, but it shouldn't be here. Its appearance in the haunted residence is definitely an anomaly. Investigate it to see what is going on.}}

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Investigate
:An advertisement board that looks a little out of place. No one would have something like this in their house.
:(Investigate closely)
:Woah, there's a wanted poster for Kafka!
:Given that some time passed since the "Ambrosial Arbor" incident, the Luofu should have already removed the wanted notice for the Stellaron Hunters. However, grassroots-level work can be slow, and you may still see Kafka's wanted poster on the streets.
:However, a wanted poster for Kafka appearing here, in the courtyard of an apparent haunted house, should raise some caution among you and your companions due to its unexpected nature.
:It shouldn't be here. You should probably get closer and take a look.
:Just as you move closer to inspect, the advertisement board suddenly flips over, like it's come to life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Touch it)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Get closer)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This must be a clue about the haunted house!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cool! Are there any more?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about a wanted poster for Blade?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want to tear it down!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She is beautiful.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought only I could hear it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I heard it. I suddenly don't really want to rescue them.
:'''Sushang:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean by a vengeful spirit? That was obviously a heliobus, right?

:A broken box that is hard to move due to its weight. The lock is corroded, and there is a hole the size of a fist on the topside. It looks like there is something metallic inside. Perhaps there is a way to get the item out from the box...
:If you use a strongly {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|magnetic stone}}, you may be able to remove the item from the box...

:'''Burnie:''' Stop, I can be reasonable... Finally, a living person for me to breathe the sweet scent of life. Let me catch my breath first...
:'''Burnie:''' What is wrong with all of you? You think these kinds of terrifying tricks are funny? You almost scared me to death!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait! Isn't the haunting caused by heliobi?
::'''Burnie:''' Who told you that? Aren't humans the ones who make houses haunted? Seriously.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do heliobi get scared?
::'''Burnie:''' Why shouldn't a heliobus get scared? It's dark and creepy in here. It's terrifying!
:'''Sushang:''' Ah, we heard from the landlord, Renault, that this place is haunted, so we came to investigate!
:'''Burnie:''' ...Oh. Renault, the landlord. Wait. You're talking about... Renault?
:'''Guinaifen:''' He said his name was Renault.
:'''Burnie:''' The owner of this house was indeed Renault, and he was a short-life species, who died a century ago. So, the person you actually saw was...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Renault's ghost!
::'''Guinaifen:''' Sushang, hey! Sushang... Wake up!
::'''Sushang:''' I, I&mdash;I'm awake!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's an imposter Renault!
::'''Guinaifen:''' That's right. The truth is just that boring.
:'''Burnie:''' I've had enough here. You lot, get me in that gourd and get me out of here. Take me somewhere with some life and yang energy!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If I call your name, do you dare to respond?
::'''Burnie:''' My name is Burnie. Hurry and claim me!
