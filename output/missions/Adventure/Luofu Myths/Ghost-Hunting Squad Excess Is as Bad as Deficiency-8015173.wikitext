::'''Manman:''' I... actually I... am one of your fans. I saw you were soliciting contributions and that you were making real life trips around, so I wondered if I might get a chance to try and meet you.
::'''Manman:''' And so I tried, but... I have to say, you're so cute in-person even when you're angry~ Your face is much smaller than on the screen. Just too cute.
::'''Manman:''' I just wanted to see you with my own eyes and really didn't mean anything else by it... During the hundred thousand fans event, I even submitted a question about whether you'd be doing any fan meet-and-greets &mdash; but sadly my question never got picked.

::'''Guinaifen:''' Mmm-hmm, good idea (Trailblazer).
::'''Guinaifen:''' Ahem, minors watching my stream is what scares me the most. Every few days, I'll get their parents requesting a refund and I'll get stung with the processing fee, meaning all my hard work streaming amounts to nothing.
::'''Manman:''' My family, they've never cared about me spending money... They won't ask for any refund. You can count on that.
::'''Guinaifen:''' Ahem, y&mdash;you think it's just about a refund?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Do you know how much effort we put into proving whether these supernatural stories of yours were true or not?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We were so busy that we couldn't even accept any ads!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah, our squad trip was all messed up by you!
::'''Manman:''' I didn't expect to put you out like this... I&mdash;I just wanted to see you, that's all. I shouldn't have tricked you. All I can do is use this money of mine to make up for all your wasted efforts. I'm really sorry...
