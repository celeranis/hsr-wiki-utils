===Discuss with the ghost-hunting squad about the post looking for help{{subst:void|<!--801515201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Fyxestroll Garden|You and your fellow ghost-hunters browse Ghostly Grove, discussing which rumors and anomalies might be caused by heliobi. Accurately distinguishing them requires 99 percent common sense and one percent intuition &mdash; some call it intuition, some call it psychic powers.}}

:'''Guinaifen:''' Waa... The loser of this chess game loses their soul! This is some kind... some kind of duel of darkness!
:'''Sushang:''' I thought you were going to say something... What do you all make of this situation?
:'''Huohuo:''' It's very mysterious.
:'''Sushang:''' It's very mysterious.
:'''Guinaifen:''' It's very mysterious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's very mysterious.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, we reached an agreement quickly!
:'''Huohuo:''' Ah... I mean, this looks like the work of a heliobus.
:'''Guinaifen:''' It could just be some kind of street performance?
:'''Sushang:''' I thought heliobi were supposed to hide and scare people from the shadows... What would one be doing causing chaos on the streets?
:'''Huohuo:''' Heliobi are stubborn creatures, we can't use human logic to judge their intentions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If it's a heliobus, I should go and check it out.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If I go and play some chess, then we'll find out.
:'''Huohuo:''' We're counting on you, (Trailblazer). If you run into any danger, contact me or Hanya right away.

===Talk to the Chess Ghost{{subst:void|<!--801515202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|As you arrive in the streets of Exalting Sanctum, you notice a few people who appear possessed, gathering around a plain-looking chessboard. What an old trick! How inefficient it is to put an unfinished chess game at the side of the road to rob people of their souls? What year is it? Heliobi should really take notes from IPC on how to harvest souls through capitalism.}}

:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer)? What are you doing here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was going to ask you the same thing...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, are you here to play chess, too?
:'''Yanqing:''' I think I'm here for the same reason you are, to subdue this heliobus.
:'''Yanqing:''' The General received an official letter from the Ten-Lords Commission and left the Seat of Divine Foresight in a hurry... I read the "List of Archenemies" before and figured that this heliobus must be a good opponent to sharpen my sword skills, so here I am.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you know where the heliobi are?
::'''Yanqing:''' Do you know about "Ghostly Grove"? I heard from someone on the site that there were strange things happening here, so I came to see.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The heliobi are very weak, they are no match for you.
::'''Yanqing:''' We all have strengths and weaknesses. The general taught me to hone my skills and not be picky about who I take as a teacher.
:'''???:''' Kid, are you playing chess or not? I figured you don't have the brains to beat me, turns out you don't even have the guts to challenge me!
:'''Yanqing:''' (Trailblazer), let me introduce you, this... heliobus? She calls herself the "Chess Ghost." Those guys at the back seem to be people who just lost to her...
:'''Chess Ghost's Defeated Opponent (I):''' Coward! You wouldn't dare challenge the Chess Ghost!
:'''Chess Ghost's Defeated Opponent (II):''' That's right, you're no match!
:'''Chess Ghost's Defeated Opponent (III):''' Coward!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You weren't the slightest bit provoked by that?
::'''Yanqing:''' ...It's more because she's ridiculous, it's hard to take her seriously...
::'''Chess Ghost:''' You wretch! How dare you be so impudent!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't even tell who's talking...
::'''Yanqing:''' It doesn't even matter...
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Enough talking! You will show me some basic respect! Will you play chess with me or not?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you going to play chess with her, Yanqing?
::'''Yanqing:''' It's embarrassing to admit but... I don't know how to play this type of chess.
::'''Yanqing:''' Normally I play Xianzhou starchess with the general... but the Chess Ghosts's "chess" is alien to me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is chess? What kind of chess is this?
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Tsk, uneducated swine! This is called the "Pathfinder." It is a puzzle game that originates from the Luofu Divination Commission.
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Responding to "Pathfinder" questions is a type of chess match that will exhaust your mental strength. Can you answer my riddles?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait, are we playing chess or doing riddles now?
::'''Chess Ghost:''' Oh, it's actually answering riddles... My mistake... Does this make me the "Riddle Ghost"?
::'''Chess Ghost:''' ...Isn't that all the same? What is the difference? They're all games of intelligence and battles of wit!
::'''Yanqing:''' Well, do you want to play a round with her?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like we have no choice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll play with you, then!
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Hah! This outworlder has some guts... Unlike you... You're clearly a Xianzhou swordsman and yet you run off with your tail between your legs!
:'''Yanqing:''' Whatever you say. I came to bring a heliobus to justice, not to play silly games.
:'''Yanqing:''' Even if you lose and end up like those she's defeated, I'll use my sword to rescue you.
:'''Chess Ghost:''' You barbarian! This is a battle of minds, you think using a sword is fair?
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Bring it on, outworlder, let's have a hearty game of chess! Are you ready?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bring it on.
::'''Chess Ghost:''' I like your courage!
