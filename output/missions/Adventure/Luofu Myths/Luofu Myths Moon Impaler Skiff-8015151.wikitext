:'''Guinaifen:''' A phantom starskiff? I heard of a similar "urban legend" long ago...
:'''Guinaifen:''' Legend says that at the Stargazer Navalia, a phantom starskiff had gradually and silently approached two workers when they were patrolling among the incubators. The skiff was as quiet as a messenger visiting from the void beyond.
:'''Guinaifen:''' The more courageous worker boarded the starskiff to take a look, only to discover that there was no one on the skiff. There was only a wailing Parrot Goblin. As he walked deeper, he found the skiff full of cargo, and even contained food that was still warm.
:'''Sushang:''' Huohuo, d&mdash;don't be afraid...
:'''Huohuo:''' But Miss Sushang, you seem to be the one trembling...
:'''Guinaifen:''' The only mystery was that the deck was covered in blood, as if there was a rough battle before... The worker examined the route map and found out that this starskiff originated from the Xianzhou Daiyu and was heading toward the Xianzhou Cangcheng.
:'''Sushang:''' But... Aren't these two Xianzhous...
:'''Huohuo:''' Looks like the starskiff had lost her direction and gone off course...
:'''Guinaifen:''' The timid worker thought he heard his partner calling and boarded the phantom starskiff... Soon after, the starskiff slowly faded from Stargazer Navalia. From then on, no one had ever seen the two workers again.
:'''Huohuo:''' Woaaahhh...
:'''Sushang:''' Huohuo...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Interesting. Is there any more?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can a heliobus create a phantom starskiff too?
::'''Huohuo:''' ...I'm not sure, but it's highly possible!
::Was a missing ship reported from Xianzhou many years ago?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was a missing ship reported from Xianzhou many years ago?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Someone saw you board the phantom starskiff.
::'''Yukong:''' There are many foxians who have a similar figure as mine. I suppose that person is mistaken.

:'''Yukong:''' It's fine to talk about these rumors during leisure time, but this is a workplace. All discussions should only be related to work.

::'''Yukong:''' It has taken form of my fallen comrade-in-arms, Caiyi.
::'''Yukong:''' I have come to Foxsomn Tomb countless times over the years to reminisce my days with Caiyi.

I even entombed the airship fragments from that great war here.

::'''Yukong:''' The Reignbow took pity on me, allowing me to once again meet the person you are in my memories. For that, I'm grateful. But I must not stay stagnant in this moment. I want to move on with my life while holding on to my memories of you.
::'''Yukong:''' Your daughter, no... Our daughter, Qingni, is doing very well now.

::The phantom and the starskiff suddenly disperse into fluttering glitters like fireflies, no longer taking shape. Your group captures these masterless heliobi into the Lunaumbra Gourd.
