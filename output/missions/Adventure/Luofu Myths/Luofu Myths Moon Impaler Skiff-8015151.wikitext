:'''Guinaifen:''' A phantom starskiff? I heard of a similar "urban legend" long ago...
:'''Guinaifen:''' Legend says that at the Stargazer Navalia, a phantom starskiff had gradually and silently approached two workers when they were patrolling among the incubators. The skiff was as quiet as a messenger visiting from the void beyond.
:'''Guinaifen:''' The more courageous worker boarded the starskiff to take a look, only to discover that there was no one on the skiff. There was only a wailing Parrot Goblin. As he walked deeper, he found the skiff full of cargo, and even contained food that was still warm.
:'''Sushang:''' Huohuo, d&mdash;don't be afraid...
:'''Huohuo:''' But Miss Sushang, you seem to be the one trembling...
:'''Guinaifen:''' The only mystery was that the deck was covered in blood, as if there was a rough battle before... The worker examined the route map and found out that this starskiff originated from the Xianzhou Daiyu and was heading toward the Xianzhou Cangcheng.
:'''Sushang:''' But... Aren't these two Xianzhous...
:'''Huohuo:''' Looks like the starskiff had lost her direction and gone off course...
:'''Guinaifen:''' The timid worker thought he heard his partner calling and boarded the phantom starskiff... Soon after, the starskiff slowly faded from Stargazer Navalia. From then on, no one had ever seen the two workers again.
:'''Huohuo:''' Woaaahhh...
:'''Sushang:''' Huohuo...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Interesting. Is there any more?
::'''Guinaifen:''' If you like it, there's a follow-up story.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Since no one manages to escape, did you make up the story?
::'''Guinaifen:''' C'mon fam, don't point it out like this.
:'''Guinaifen:''' Since someone has witnessed the ghost ship, it may be a heliobus' doing. We are going to investigate it, no?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can a heliobus create a phantom starskiff too?
::'''Huohuo:''' ...I'm not sure, but it's highly possible!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was a missing ship reported from Xianzhou many years ago?
::'''Guinaifen:''' From what I know, there were many!
:'''Huohuo:''' ...A&mdash;As long as we don't board the starskiff, we should be fine, Miss Sushang.

::'''Huohuo:''' (Trailblazer), what are you doing?

:'''Sushang:''' (Could you be any less indiscreet!?)
:'''Guinaifen:''' (I got nervous!)
:'''Yukong:''' I'm sorry. I have no idea about it. I believe it's just an absurd legend.

:'''Yukong:''' Perhaps it was just an illusion of light or a speedy starskiff... Please, why don't you be honest with me? What's the intention behind your visit? The Sky-Faring Commission does not register any imaginary starskiff.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Someone saw you board the phantom starskiff.
::'''Yukong:''' There are many foxians who have a similar figure as mine. I suppose that person is mistaken.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You had even talked to the people on the starskiff.
:::'''Yukong:''' Your story is pretty convincing.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mistaken Madam Yukong for someone else? Are you serious?
:::'''Yukong:''' That's how rumors and street talks come about. Some things didn't happen, yet they can make it sound conclusive.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I heard that you don't allow your staff to discuss the skiff...
::'''Yukong:''' A phantom starskiff appearing in Stargazer Navalia? It is not my first time hearing such a ghost story. Ever since I entered the Sky-Faring Commission, I've heard such legends every few decades. There're all different stories, yet every single one is detailed and convincing.
::'''Yukong:''' It's fine to talk about these rumors during leisure time, but this is a workplace. All discussions should only be related to work.
::'''Yukong:''' Do you think it's useful for the Sky-Faring Commission members to discuss these nonsensical rumors about a starskiff all day long?
:'''Sushang:''' (What should we do? Madam Yukong's answers are impeccable...)
:'''Guinaifen:''' (Why don't we get honest with her?)
:'''Huohuo:''' Ma-Madam Yukong, I'm a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission... Well, I'm afraid that you have been affected by a heliobus...
:'''Huohuo:''' As it's inconvenient for us to handle this matter in the Palace of Astrum, we would like to invite you to Fyxestroll Garden for a thorough check.
:'''Yukong:''' You suspect that I'm being possessed by a heliobus?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right!

:'''Qingni:''' Are you serious? But in the past, she would never reveal such a melancholic expression. Sometimes, she becomes so distracted that she stares blankly at me without uttering a word...
:'''Qingni:''' It's like she suddenly turned into a child who needs me to put her to sleep. I don't know what to do either, so I can only embrace her silently in my arms.
:'''Qingni:''' We had such a huge crisis on the Xianzhou a short while ago, but she didn't show a single sign of weakness back then. Yet she came home one day and started to act in this way... I&mdash;I can't think of other possibilities.

::'''Sushang:''' Exactly. The stronger the person appears to be, the better they are in concealing their soft side. That's how my Ma is.

::'''Guinaifen:''' Yeah, for someone as approachable as Miss Qingni to detect a change in her personality, it's likely due to an unnatural phenomenon.

::'''Yukong:''' It has taken form of my fallen comrade-in-arms, Caiyi.
::'''Yukong:''' I have come to Foxsomn Tomb countless times over the years to reminisce my days with Caiyi. Back then, we told each other everything, we understood each other without needing words as we flew, and we fought passionately side by side... I even entombed the airship fragments from that great war here.

::'''"Caiyi":''' You haven't been to Foxsomn Tomb for a long time, but your sadness only grows ever greater. I... had to come and find you.
::'''Yukong:''' I thought I'd gotten used to not thinking of you. But when I boarded the starskiff and saw you again, I remembered those bygone days and was reduced to a weak foxian girl once more, a little kit who could do nothing but cry.
::'''"Caiyi":''' I can taste your salty tears... you have never stopped crying in your heart...

::'''Yukong:''' I'm sorry, Caiyi. I've asked a Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission to come here... so I came to bid goodbye to you.
::'''Yukong:''' The Reignbow took pity on me, allowing me to once again meet the person you are in my memories. For that, I'm grateful. But I must not stay stagnant in this moment. I want to move on with my life while holding on to my memories of you.
::'''Yukong:''' Your daughter, no... Our daughter, Qingni, is doing very well now.
