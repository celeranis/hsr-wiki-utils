::'''Guinaifen:''' (Trailblazer), have you seen that post? I talked to the OP, and she claimed that she knew you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} March 7th?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} She had a paranormal encounter?
::'''Sushang:''' Does that mean the requester is someone you know?
::'''Guinaifen:''' Yes, Miss March 7th is a member of the Express' Nameless and (Trailblazer)'s important companion.
::'''Huohuo:''' Come to think of it, we saw a heliobus wandering around her the last time, and it suddenly disappeared... Could it be related to this event?
::'''Guinaifen:''' No point in making wild guesses here. Since the requester is a member of the Crew, we'll leave this matter to you, (Trailblazer).
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to the Galactic Baseballer.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Giving all the tough work to me, huh?
:::'''Guinaifen:''' Hey, I put all my trust in you. Moreover, you know the requester well, so it's easier for you to handle it.
:::'''Sushang:''' Is interacting with Miss March 7th... a tiresome job?
:::'''Guinaifen:''' It shouldn't be. I believe (Trailblazer) was only kidding.
::'''Huohuo:''' Here... take this talisman with you. Place it on the suspect and you'll know if that person has been possessed by the heliobus.

::'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), you're finally back!

::'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), you're finally back!
::What happened?
::'''March 7th:''' After bidding goodbyes to you and Huohuo that day, I returned to the Express to look at my photographs, and guess what?
::'''March 7th:''' All my beautiful photos &mdash; and I do mean all &mdash; have these new and weird shadows inside them. It's so scary.
::'''March 7th:''' Say, do you think this Express is haunted? What should I do...
::You explain to March 7th about the ghost-hunting squad and the talisman.
::'''March 7th:''' Oh... In other words, this talisman is the same as the one you pasted on me previously.
::'''March 7th:''' That sounds like a great idea. We can use it to check every member of the Crew, and we will be able to find the one possessed by the heliobus in no time.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go.
:::'''March 7th:''' Great! Sounds like we're investigating a case.
:::Stay here and don't wander around.
:::'''March 7th:''' Huh? Don't fly solo. Count me in too!
:::You can take some pictures there and come back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Stay here and don't wander around.
:::'''March 7th:''' Huh? Don't fly solo. Count me in too!
:::You can take some pictures there and come back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can take some pictures there and come back.
::'''March 7th:''' Ugh... You're trying to get rid of me. No way, this time, I'm coming too!
::'''March 7th:''' Don't worry. I'm experienced. When Huohuo placed it on me, I observed how she did it. This time, I want to try placing a talisman on someone else.

:'''March 7th:''' This shouldn't be the case. Everyone on the Express is normal. Where could the heliobus be hiding?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps the problem lies with you...
:'''March 7th:''' Me? How can it be? Didn't you test me the last time?

:'''March 7th:''' This shouldn't be the case. Everyone on the Express is normal. Where could the heliobus be hiding?

:'''March 7th:''' Me? How can it be? Didn't you test me the last time?
:'''March 7th:''' Forget it. Come and slap it on me again.
:You carefully check March 7th's entire person. Finally, the talisman begins to glow. The source of the problem lies with... March 7th's camera.
:'''March 7th:''' I can't believe... it's really me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It is one of the fragments that escaped the other day.
:'''March 7th:''' Oh, no wonder the talisman doesn't react when it's on me. It turns out that the heliobus was hidden in my precious camera! Dastardly!

:{{DIcon|Talk}} What were you doing in the camera?

::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you think I should do with you?
::'''Arkeri:''' In ancient times, beyond my memory, the ancestral heliobi wandered around the universe without any intention or worries... And I think that was pretty good.
::'''Arkeri:''' I intend to follow my ancestor's example &mdash; leave the Xianzhou, rejoin the universe, and live a life of freedom. I don't get along well with the heliobi that feed on humans' emotions.
::'''Arkeri:''' ...I know it's hard to fulfill this wish. So, no matter what you plan to do with me, please allow me to see the scenery in those photos first.
::'''Arkeri:''' If I'm sealed with my regrets, I won't be able to burn brightly anymore!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} March, what do you think?
::'''March 7th:''' Hmm... You mentioned before that a heliobus' possession will do a lot of harm to the host. However, I haven't felt anything so far, which means it hasn't done any harm to me.
::'''March 7th:''' And since it appreciates my photos, how can it be bad!?
::'''March 7th:''' So... I don't see what's wrong with fulfilling its wish. Coincidentally, I plan to walk around the Luofu again to take more pictures, shopping, and enjoy the delicacies. I'll bring it with me then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go. Time to shop and eat!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} All you know is to eat...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure, but I'll accompany you.
::'''Arkeri:''' Thank you... There are still many kind people in the world.

::'''March 7th:''' Uh, that's true... After all, you came here for this mission.
::'''March 7th:''' But... the heliobus said it wants to leave the Xianzhou. Seeing that it didn't cause any harm, perhaps we can consider its suggestion?
::I want to release it somewhere among the stars.
::'''March 7th:''' Yes, I want to let it go on an adventure, too. We're all companions trying to "Trailblaze" our own paths, right?
::'''March 7th:''' But with regard to the Ten-Lords Commission... you probably need to give them an explanation. And besides, this little guy didn't cause any harm.
