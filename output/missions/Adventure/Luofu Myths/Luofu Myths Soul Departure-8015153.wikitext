===Ask the poster for more details===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|You and your fellow ghost-hunters browse Ghostly Grove, discussing which rumors and anomalies might be caused by heliobi. Accurately distinguishing them requires 99 percent common sense and one percent intuition &mdash; some call it intuition, some call it psychic powers.<br />A post titled "My neighbor's dead wife seems to have come back" strikes an incongruous chord in your mind. You decide to meet the person who made the post.}}
