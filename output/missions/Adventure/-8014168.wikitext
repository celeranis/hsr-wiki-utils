:'''Herta:''' "I suddenly had a brilliant idea." Herta suddenly pops up. "Didn't Screwy say last time that the Simulated Universe's storage function still needs iterating? We can actually use the code errors this time to verify the limit of the current 'RAM'!"

:'''Herta:''' "It's just an example. Something like that." Herta dismisses the notion. "The Simulated Universe is not a game. Don't let Stephen Lloyd hear you, otherwise he'd get excited just from hearing the word 'save'... That guy wants to make every game mode under the sun!"
