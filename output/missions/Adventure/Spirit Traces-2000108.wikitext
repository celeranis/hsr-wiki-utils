===Discuss the Letter From Locus Silentii with Asta===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Master Control Zone|Asta claims to have received a secret letter written by a Cryptologist From Locus Silentii, which not only revealed the whereabouts of the Xenohydro that had been missing for a long time but also tacitly implicates that someone in the space station has been covering up for the escaped Curio. The cautious lead researcher asks you to investigate.}}
