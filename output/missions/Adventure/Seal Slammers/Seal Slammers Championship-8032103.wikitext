:{{DIcon|Talk}} Dromas
----
:The dromas sits motionless, as silent as the earth itself, saying nothing.
:It's said to be its way of protesting, "non-violence, non-cooperation."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've got some Redsoil Feed, could you leave now?
:'''Dromas:''' Grumph, grumph&mdash;
:The dromas remains unresponsive.

;(Unused &mdash; EnterDistrict_G757)
:'''Cipher:''' Ah, they say that because Dorian, the Mountain Dweller, was replaced by the Spirithief, the dromas is upset and has come to protest!
::'''Apophis:''' It chose the off-season to make its appearance, which is a relatively friendly form of protest, I suppose.
::'''Trinnon:''' If '''we&ast;'''re not mistaken... this is the "giant beast rests in the abyss" mentioned in the prophecy, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's call on the prophecy expert, Lady Trinnon!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, is this prophecy real?
::{{tx}}
::{{tx}}
::{{tx}}
::I can feel everyone's eager, burning stares.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Everyone, I have a vision of Amphoreus!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Sorry, but I still can't share it.
:::'''Cipher:''' Then I'll tickle you until you spill it...
::'''Trinnon:''' Please believe in '''us'''. '''We''' won't let you pay any price.
::After some mental preparation, you explained the entire process of the prophetic dream... Yet, you didn't transform into a baby seal.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (And... nothing happened...)
::'''Trinnon:''' Of course, the "price" of becoming a baby seal is false too. However, will Little Gray meet Chimera Bubbles and a nimble "ranger," to defy the destiny of the breaking trophy?
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 06.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo~ Even though I now understand why (Trailblazer) can't speak of it, I still feel a little hurt inside...
::We could secretly swap out the trophy!
::How about just handing the trophy to me directly?
::'''Apophis:''' No, the champion has to be crowned through the competition itself.
::Let's hide the trophy somewhere safe.
::'''Apophis:''' The championship is almost here... we can't hide it forever.
::What if I shatter the trophy myself?
::'''Apophis:''' Don't give up just yet, let's brainstorm some more.
::'''Cipher:''' Prepare a fake trophy, and I'll use a single instant to switch it with the real trophy. That way, even if anyone believes the false prophecy and breaks the trophy, they won't know that they've broken a fake!
::'''Cipher:''' But the issue is dispelling the '''seamstress's golden thread''' &mdash; it only listens to you three Mythemis brothers!
::'''Apophis:''' Dispelling the golden thread is straightforward, but the trophy is so conspicuous &mdash; if we don't want anyone to notice what we're up to...
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 05.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Everyone, Bubbles has an idea, it'll draw everyone's attention and also break (Trailblazer)'s prophetic dream.
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 11.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' &mdash;I've decided to leave (Trailblazer)'s team.
::I think I know why... but what's the reason?
::Did I... did I do something wrong?
::Bubbles, oh my dear Bubbles, don't go&mdash;!
::You look at Bubbles, your expression complicated...
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 01.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo... I definitely didn't just decide this on a whim, (Trailblazer). No need to beg me to stay &mdash; hopefully you'll make good use of this chance...
::'''Apophis:''' How touching! In light of Bubbles's efforts, let's hold a grand press conference for the team transfer. Lady Cipher, I'll have prepared a replica by then. We'll leave the switch to you.
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 01.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo... (Trailblazer), I know you've got something to say &mdash; how about we discuss it at the press conference?
::'''Apophis:''' What? There are new prophecies?
::'''Trinnon:''' Indeed. Apart from "the golden trophy shatters with no champion," '''we''' have heard two more at the baths: "black tide muddles clear waters" and "giant beast rests in the abyss"...
::'''Trinnon:''' Don't worry, everyone. In the name of the demigods, '''we''' assure you that these "three calamities" are merely fabrications.
::'''Trinnon:''' However, '''we''' cannot foresee whether any Okhema citizens might act on these prophecies. Besides, what we've heard may only be part of the whole prophecy.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (In Phagousa's prophetic dream, there was also "look for your companions," and...)
::'''Cipher:''' Come on, Gray Mystery, what prophecy did you hear exactly? Why don't you share it with everyone?
::'''Trinnon:''' There are contradictory elements in the prophecy, making it hard to distinguish truth from fiction...
::'''Cipher:''' Rangers? That title rings a bell. Are they referring to me?
::'''Cipher:''' Do I really have to let some '''arbitrary prophecy''' push me into playing hero with you to save some trophy? Tch! What a childish game.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Since you took Tribbie's payment anyway...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've helped once, what's one more time?

:'''Apophis:''' Breaking news! As Seal Slammers heats up, the uproar over Bubbles the little chimera's team transfer has become a hot topic among citizens.
:The audience at the baths stares at you intently.
:'''Apophis:''' Is this a contest of honor and wealth, or a clash of dreams and ambition? Today we're fortunate to interview Bubbles and (Trailblazer). Say hello to everyone&mdash;
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 01.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Hello everyone, I'm Bubbles the Chimera.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Hello, everyone. I'm... not feeling so great.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hello, everyone. I'm (Trailblazer).
:'''Apophis:''' Bubbles, could you tell us the reason behind your team transference? Was it unfair treatment, a harsh contract, conflicts with teammates, or...some other undisclosed details? Fill us in.
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 02.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo? None of that. (Trailblazer) has always been a partner I trust!
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 13.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' It's only that... after having faced off against Lady Trinnon, I had some new insights...
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 07.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo... You know, (Trailblazer), Bubbles has always been suspicious... Did you choose me as your partner because you believed in me?
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 06.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' I know we've been winning all the way, but knowing this is "the prophecy's arrangement," Bubbles feels disappointed...
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 13.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Bubbles wants to use their own true potential to become (Trailblazer)'s partner, not just because of the prophecy. Especially after witnessing Lady Trinnon's motivations and experiences during the competition. Bubbles thinks that they should be like her and assume personal responsibility!
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 11.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Once Bubbles leaves you, Bubbles will prove themself with new accomplishments! This will let (Trailblazer) recognize me wholeheartedly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see. I respect your choice.
::{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 01.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Right on. I knew I was right about you!
::No! Bubbles, take me with you, Bubbles...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No! Bubbles, take me with you, Bubbles...
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 02.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' ...(Trailblazer)... please don't ask me to stay anymore.

:'''Amorphis:''' ... After I dispelled the golden thread's tether, Lady Cipher vanished from in front of me with the trophy.
::'''Amorphis:''' I stood there waiting for Lady Cipher to return, but in the end... she never came back.
::'''Apophis:''' Lady Aglaea, what do you think &mdash; just who is this Chrysos Heir...?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I've long suspected that Cipher was suspicious.
:::'''Aglaea:''' Cipher is the demigod of "Trickery" &mdash; her presence is trickery in itself.
:::Aglaea, your cat repellent device has failed...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aglaea, your cat repellent device has failed...
::'''Aglaea:''' I never expected the golden thread could stop Amphoreus's most cunning thief &mdash; Cipher.
::'''Aglaea:''' I've already heard the whole story from my teachers.
::'''Aglaea:''' Hmph. A thousand years have passed, and her methods still haven't changed.
::'''Aglaea:''' Until it's exposed, "Trickery" is almost like a prophecy in effect &mdash; that is, she targeted the Gold Seal Cup from the start, then used falsehoods to show you a prophetic dream.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Her "Trickery" started before the competition?
:::'''Aglaea:''' Exactly. It began with that ridiculous dream of yours.
:::What about the prophecy that "the golden trophy shatters"?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the prophecy that "the golden trophy shatters"?
::'''Aglaea:''' It was never going to break.
::'''Aglaea:''' She fabricated a prophecy of "three great calamities," then hid lies among truths to let them spread.
::'''Aglaea:''' Then she pretended to be an ally who could "see through lies," tricking you into handing her the trophy she couldn't otherwise steal.
::'''Aglaea:''' And now, the cunning thief has her prize in hand. She won't appear again.
::The spot for the trophy is completely empty, as if Cipher is mocking you: "Hey, the thing you fought over is already in my treasure trove!"
::'''Apophis:''' We failed to secure the trophy properly, and we brothers feel truly ashamed. Lady Aglaea, please forgive us.
::'''Amorphis:''' Perhaps... there's still a chance to find Cipher before the championship begins...
::'''Aglaea:''' No worries. Our first priority is getting ready for the match. If we can't hold the match because the trophy's stolen, that'd be a total loss.
::'''Aglaea:''' You were deceived by a dream of lies, and your trusted partner left you &mdash; (Trailblazer), are you alright?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even though the trophy's gone, the championship title is still up for grabs!
:::'''Aglaea:''' I like your optimism.
:::I'm a bit disappointed, but the match has to go on.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm a bit disappointed, but the match has to go on.
::'''Aglaea:''' I'm sorry. I can sense how let down you feel.
::'''Aglaea:''' (Trailblazer), why not hear my prophecy?
::'''Aglaea:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|You will surely punish the trophy thief and reclaim the honor that's rightfully yours.}}
::'''Aglaea:''' {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|You will definitely find the partner who left you and fight alongside them again.}}
