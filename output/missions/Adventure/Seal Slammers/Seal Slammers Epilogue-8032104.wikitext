;(Talk to Krateros)
----
:'''Perhippas:''' I... I really missed the final match, didn't I? Ahem..
:'''"Yourdei":''' Master, I've come up with a new strategy.
:'''"Yourdei":''' Next time, I'll invite them to the high-temperature bath. That's us Kremnoans' true home turf.
:'''Krateros:''' Bold and full of potential! What a clever plan!
:'''Timos:''' Champion, you've arrived! I'd love a photo with you...
:'''Krateros:''' Shut up. (Trailblazer), be careful with this one. After a photo with him, you'll end up as the ambassador for Superhero Shower Soap.

;(Talk to Tribbie)
----
:'''Phainon:''' I heard we're shouting for the group photo again, seal seal... splash...?
:'''Tribbie:''' Snowy still didn't get it right, it's Seal Slammers!
:'''Trinnon:''' Snowy, do you mean one seal jumps into the water, splash?
:'''Trinnon:''' Two seals jump into the water, splish-splash?
:'''Tribbie:''' Mmph...
:'''Phainon:''' Umm...
:'''Trinnon:''' Eh? Did Trinnon's words freeze everyone in place?

;(Talk to Hyacine)
----
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 02.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' The competition is over. Do I still need to go back to the Garden of Life?
:'''Hyacine:''' What's your decision, Bubbles? Do you want to team up with Grayie, or would you prefer to stick with the little chimeras? It's your call.
:{{A|VO side4 haibao chimera 12.ogg}} '''Bubbles:''' Awoo! Bubbles can already get along with the other little chimeras just fine, but I want to stay with (Trailblazer)'s team!
:'''Hyacine:''' I knew it. Grayie is the true great hero in Bubbles' heart.
:'''Hyacine:''' Ahem... The chimera caretakers who've been troubled by Bubbles' boundless energy can finally let out a sigh of relief.

:{{DIcon|undefined}} (Take a photo together)
----
:The soothing rhythm of the water lyre blended with the voice of the bard in the bath...
:'''Bard's Voice:''' "Grant me a golden wine cup, and a brew more precious than gold..."
:'''Bard's Voice:''' "Grant me today's joy, so I may forget the sorrows of yesterday..."
:'''Amorphis:''' Burp, I'll count to three, and everyone shouts with me: "Seal Slammers"!
:'''Amorphis:''' Alright! Everyone in position, are you all ready?
:'''Bard's Voice:''' "Remember fate, though even the gods occasionally forget it to play tricks on the world..."
:'''Bard's Voice:''' "Sing and drink with abandon. Return the quiet sorrows to Thanatos, and let the passion and laughter of Phagousa fill the air."
:'''Amorphis:''' One, two, three&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Seal Slammers!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bubbles' Booming Slammers!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Cheese&mdash;
:'''Everyone:''' "Seal Slammers"!

:'''Apophis:''' Thank you. Thank you all for your incredible support. We... never thought this celebration would be this lively.
:'''Apophis:''' Not only did we attract so many spectators, but so many popular competitors joined in, and in the end, we managed to reclaim the lost trophy.
:'''Amorphis:''' Burp~ I want to leave a lasting memory of this celebration! I hope our champion (Trailblazer) will hold up the trophy and take a photo with our guests. Burp&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Make sure I look good in the shot!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't drink too much or your hand will be shaking!
:'''Amorphis:''' Burp~ Don't worry. When you're ready, just bring the trophy and come find us!
