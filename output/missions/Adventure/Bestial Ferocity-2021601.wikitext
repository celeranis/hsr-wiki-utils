===Ask the weird person about the cause of the argument{{subst:void|<!--202160102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|The person quarreling with Gao Tang is someone odd. Although it sounds like a misunderstanding, this person named Benna does seem to have her own problems. Looks like it's time to lend a helping hand again.}}
