===Listen to why Gao Tang is quarreling{{subst:void|<!--202160101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Gao Tang is a proud and arrogant chef, but it's not like him to argue with people on the streets... As someone famous throughout the cosmos for your curiosity, you decide to go over and listen to what they are arguing about.}}

;(Talk to ???)
----
:'''???:''' Alas, my poor Faunus Red Sheep. They didn't even get to enjoy much freedom after leaving the harsh pen... Oh, Aeon of Abundance who spares us from suffering, please don't forfeit my merit for this!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aeon of Abundance?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?
:'''???:''' Shh, can you keep your voice low? I'm just an outworlder who lives here and keeps to myself. I have nothing to do with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.
:'''???:''' Greetings, my name is Benna. I like to set animals free with some of my outworlder friends when I have the time.
:'''Benna:''' Let me make it clear that I'm different from those evil people who kill and steal in the name of Abundance. On the contrary, my friends and I are practicing the virtuous side of Abundance with our actions!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you bothering Gao Tang then?
:'''Benna:''' It's because the Faunus Red Sheep I released have gone missing! The lovely sheep with crimson wool is an endangered species in their home. So, I've spent a fortune to buy a herd of them, thinking of releasing them into the Scalegorge Waterscape...
:'''Benna:''' But when I went back home to check on them, I realized they were all gone!
:'''Benna:''' Alas, it would be great if an expert investigator could suddenly show up here... I wish the investigator would be generous and willing to help kind people like us gratuitously...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's me.
::'''Benna:''' You... Could you help me find out the truth behind the disappearance of the Faunus Red Sheep? I knew you were a kind soul the first time I met you!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But my help isn't gratuitous.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} About my pay...
::'''Benna:''' That's so mercenary of you. When I released the sheep, I never thought of asking them for my money back.
::'''Benna:''' You should know that by helping me, you're helping those missing sheep too, and that will earn you merit with the Aeon of Abundance. You'll be in good health and have great luck in the future.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pay me, and I'll help you.
::'''Benna:''' That's so mercenary of you. When I released the sheep, I never thought of asking them for my money back.
::'''Benna:''' You should know that by helping me, you're helping those missing sheep too, and that will earn you merit with the Aeon of Abundance. You'll be in good health and have great luck in the future.
::'''Benna:''' Fine, I get it. Both sheep and humans have to eat well to survive. Since someone is willing to give up merits in exchange for cold hard credits, I'll fulfill {{MC|f=her|m=his}} wish.
::'''Benna:''' Let's exchange numbers to keep in touch. As I have other businesses to manage, I'll leave the Faunus Red Sheep case to you.
::'''Benna:''' Let's meet at the Alchemy Commission to discuss updates on the investigation.
::----
;(All choices lead to the following options)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right. Money is the only reward I want.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's merit? Can you eat it?
:'''Benna:''' Fine, I get it. Both sheep and humans have to eat well to survive. Since someone is willing to give up merits in exchange for cold hard credits, I'll fulfill {{MC|f=her|m=his}} wish.
:'''Benna:''' Let's exchange numbers to keep in touch. As I have other businesses to manage, I'll leave the Faunus Red Sheep case to you.
:'''Benna:''' Let's meet at the Alchemy Commission to discuss updates on the investigation.

;(Talk to Jingyan)
:'''Jingyan:''' What brings you to the Realm-Keeping Commission today?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd like to borrow a Diting...
::'''Jingyan:''' Do you mind telling us the purpose of your loan? Diting is forensic equipment. By right, it can't be lent to civilians.
::You talked about Benna and the matter about the Fau-whatever Red Sheep.
::After listening to you, Jingyan heaves out a meaningful sigh.
::'''Jingyan:''' It happens again... You can borrow this Diting, but you have to submit your result to us after you complete your investigation.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you so much!
:::'''Jingyan:''' Don't mention it. It's my job to help people with their problems.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is there a problem?
:::'''Jingyan:''' Hmm... I'm not sure. Why don't you check out the situation first? Just drop me a line if there is a problem.
::'''Jingyan:''' Please be careful, though I know you can probably deal with any danger with your combat skills.
:'''Jingyan:''' Please stay safe and be careful. Just drop me a line if there is a problem.

:You are simply a walking, moving lunch. A pack of wolves watches you hungrily. They are hungry.

:{{Black Screen|It doesn't take you a lot of effort to finish off the hungry wolves. As you were about to check their carcasses, a graceful but sarcastic female voice comes from behind you.}}
:'''???:''' Oh, no. You killed them... What shall we do?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't feed myself to them, right?
::'''???:''' Indeed, nature doesn't dictate who is born to be the prey, but you could have spared their lives. Humans are intelligent because we can decide how much violence to use based on the situation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They attacked me first.
::'''???:''' Even so, did you really have to kill them? Humans are intelligent because we can decide how much violence to use based on the situation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You will impose a fine on me next?
::'''???:''' Not at all. I'm not the one who released the wolves, nor do I represent the Luofu government. So, I don't have the authority to do so.
:'''???:''' Let me introduce myself. My friends on the Luofu called me Zhongshan. Those who are closer to me also called me Zhongshanshan.
:'''Zhongshan:''' My friend, you may not be aware that you have killed an animal released by the Unshackled. They are a group that enjoys rescuing animals from dangerous situations and releasing them.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Your actions earlier not only undermined your own merit, but also nullified the good deeds of a member of the Unshackled...
:'''Zhongshan:''' At this point, you might not be able to understand the belief of the Unshackled. Just be aware that "these wolves are owned by someone." That's it.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Your actions earlier not only broke the heart of the Unshackled member, but may have also enraged that merciful Aeon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aeons wouldn't care about such trivial matters...
::'''Zhongshan:''' Who knows? The will of the divine is unpredictable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What will happen if I enrage the Aeon?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Who knows? The will of the divine is unpredictable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It doesn't matter, as I already detest the Plagues Author!
::'''Zhongshan:''' It's up to you to decide how you feel toward each deity, but...
:'''Zhongshan:''' Members of the Unshackled wouldn't be happy to see their hard-earned merits going down the drain.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Why don't you come with me to meet the Four Benevolent Ones of the Unshackled and explain yourself? Sorry, it's the Three Benevolent Ones now...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this a new scam?
::'''Zhongshan:''' I don't think they will ask you for compensation. After all, money means nothing to them. They attach great importance to intangible merits.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Even with three or four helpers, you still aren't my match.
::'''Zhongshan:''' I told you I wasn't looking to fight you. Why are you being so uptight? You just killed several wolves unarmed. Who would have the guts to challenge you?
:'''Zhongshan:''' Just see me as a tutor who recruits new followers and encourages people to do good.
:'''Zhongshan:''' The Four Benevolent Ones... Sorry, the Three Benevolent Ones should be at the Alchemy Commission right now. Let's head over there.

:'''Zhongshan:''' Look, the four people over there are the Four Benevolent Ones of the Unshackled. Let me introduce them to you...
:'''Zhongshan:''' The woman on the left is Tonya, the leading figure of the Beast Faction in the Unshackled and passionate about releasing powerful wild beasts. The wolves you killed were released by her.
:'''Zhongshan:''' I think you've met the one next to Tonya. Her name is Benna, and she's the leader of the Nurture Faction. This faction mainly releases rare, fragile, and endangered animals.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Next is Heathmann. He leads the Plant Faction that is dedicated to releasing plants.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Last but not least, that's Nannan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Their names are all over the place...
:'''Zhongshan:''' This fella is a local, but he's just been jointly ousted from the Four Benevolent Ones by the other three.
:'''Zhongshan:''' It's because he likes to release... the microorganisms in water. The other three leaders think he's not taking the act of releasing life seriously, so they called him leader of the Fooling Around Faction and kicked him out.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Please wait here while I explain your incident to them.
:{{Black Screen|Zhongshan approaches the Four Benevolent Ones and talks to them. After a while, she turns around and beckons you over.}}

;(Talk to Zhongshan)
:----
::'''Tonya:''' Zhongshan, is this the young talent who is interested in joining us?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Yes, this is (Trailblazer). Some of you might have heard of that name... This is the distinguished guest invited by General Jing Yuan of the Seat of Divine Foresight.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see you know who I am...
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Huh? Don't you realize how famous you are?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} When did I say I want to join them?
:::'''Zhongshan:''' When you agreed to come with me and meet them. Didn't you say yes because you wanted to do good and learn more about the way of Abundance and the Unshackled?
::'''Benna:''' Wait a minute... Isn't this the person I hired to investigate the disappearance of the Faunus Red Sheep? Have you got to the bottom of it?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Yes, yes. It was a bunch of Abominations of Abundance that ate your sheep. Don't worry! This {{MC|f=heroine|m=hero}}, (Trailblazer), already eliminated those monsters!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I already told you that wolves attacked first.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not injured, so there's no need to pay for my medical fees.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, I did. So what?
::'''Tonya:''' E&mdash;Eliminated them? You killed the wolves I released? How brutal!
::'''Tonya:''' And you, Zhongshan! What do you mean by the "Abominations of Abundance"? How many times do I have to repeat myself? Those that received Yaoshi's blessing are no abominations!
::'''Benna:''' So, Tonya, you are the culprit! I only released the Faunus Red Sheep in the Scalegorge Waterscape because I thought that area was free of beasts. Why did you release the wolves there too?
::'''Heathmann:''' Shut up, both of you. The gold-fringed alfalfa I released were all eaten by the sheep.
::'''Benna:''' Your annoying alfalfa grew all over the place and disrupted the entire ecosystem of that planet! If it hadn't been for your alfalfas, the Faunus Red Sheep population wouldn't have boomed, and they wouldn't have been hunted to near extinction by the local hunters, and I wouldn't have had to buy them at a high price and release them!
::'''Nannan:''' Alright, stop bickering! It isn't appropriate to fight before outsiders!
::'''Tonya:''' Keep your mouth shut, you mineral water-releasing clown!
::'''Nannan:''' What's wrong with releasing the Scalegorge Spring Water? At least I won't get embroiled in this ridiculous battle of the food chain! What exactly are you guys doing? Are you releasing animals or holding a beast fight?
::'''Benna:''' A certain suspended employee shouldn't be fanning the flames here!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll leave you to your argument.
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Hey, please don't go... I'll mediate their dispute.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this how you welcome new members?
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Ahhh... Please don't be offended. We argue only because of the firm conviction we hold in our hearts.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not decide the winner through a fight? I'll be the referee.
:::'''Zhongshan:''' It's not good to resort to violence. As practitioners of the way of Abundance, we should cherish life instead of hurting ourselves.
::'''Zhongshan:''' Everyone, please stop fighting.
::'''Zhongshan:''' Although (Trailblazer) has killed the wolves released by Tonya and ruined those kind efforts, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} intends to redeem this error by joining the Unshackled. They'll do a lot of kind deeds in the future.
::'''Zhongshan:''' How does that sound, everyone?
::'''Tonya:''' Sob, sob, my darling wolves... No! I can't accept this!
::'''Benna:''' I'm fine with it. After all, (Trailblazer) has helped me get to the bottom of the disappearance of the Faunus Red Sheep.
::'''Nannan:''' It's nay for me too! This person seems to be violent by nature. Can they understand the spirit of "releasing life"?
::'''Tonya:''' Enough, mineral water guy! Hmph, I can let {{MC|f=her|m=him}} join us, but I'll be especially strict with them.
::'''Heathmann:''' I have no problem with that.

::'''Benna:''' Zhongshan has a point. Let's test (Trailblazer)'s abilities through the newcomer trial.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me reiterate that I have no intention of joining.
:::'''Tonya:''' That won't do. Now that you have killed my wolves, you must contribute the same amount of merits whether you join our group or not. That's the only way I'll forgive you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine. What do I have to do?

;(Talk to Benna)
:'''Benna:''' What's the matter, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are the criteria for a species that can be released by the Nurture Faction...?
:'''Benna:''' Our position is pretty straightforward &mdash; We aim to rescue and protect endangered species that are so overhunted and scarce that they can hardly sustain their population.
:'''Benna:''' Alas... it was for this reason that I released the Faunus Red Sheep into Scalegorge Waterscape. Little did I know that I was sending them to their demise!

;(Talk to Heathmann)
:'''Heathmann:''' Looking for me?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are the criteria for a species that can be released by the Plant Faction...?
:'''Heathmann:''' Capable of photosynthesis, easy to cultivate, and has no excretion... that would be a "plant," the perfect creature to be released.

;(Talk to Nannan)
:'''Nannan:''' Oh? Anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any suggestions for the newcomer trial?

;(Talk to Tonya)
:'''Tonya:''' If you can pass this trial, it shows that you have great potential.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are the criteria for a species that can be released by the Beast Faction...?
:'''Tonya:''' If you ask me, I think everyone from the Unshackled should endeavor to free powerful beasts from human captivity! No more hunting falcons or fighting dogs! Let them unleash their vitality in nature!
:'''Tonya:''' After all, isn't it in line with the laws of nature and the way of The Hunt on the Xianzhou to allow living creatures to hunt freely in an environment suitable for them?

----
:'''Zhongshan:''' (Trailblazer), let's compile a summary and see whether there are similarities among these three...
:'''Zhongshan:''' Firstly, there's Tonya. She wants to free powerful beasts from human control.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Next, it's Benna. Her goal is to rescue endangered species that are unable to reproduce.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Lastly, it's Heathmann. His criteria are the simplest yet most demanding, as he's only interested in plants.
:'''Zhongshan:''' In other words, we need to find an endangered and ferocious... plant? This is so challenging... Do you have any ideas?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A man-eating plant?
:'''Zhongshan:''' Do you mean a carnivorous plant? That's indeed a ferocious plant, but I don't think they are endangered species. If you've been to Vonwacq, you'll know it's full of carnivorous crown flowers.
:'''Zhongshan:''' Lately there have been sightings of scary "leaf walkers" on the Xianzhou &mdash; creatures with foliage growing all over their body! It's hard to say whether those things are human or plant, but I don't think anyone would want to keep them in captivity...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about inorganic beings?
:'''Zhongshan:''' Do you mean mechanical creatures like cycranes and Ditings?
:'''Zhongshan:''' Hmm... Your idea sounded outrageous at first, but now that I think about it... it sounds even more outrageous!
:'''Zhongshan:''' What's ferocious about cycranes? Besides, people see them flying by all the time &mdash; they couldn't be endangered!
:'''Zhongshan:''' If there exists a mechanical lifeform species that is unable to be repaired or manufactured for some reason, it might fit the criteria. However, I've never heard of such a place.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've been to a world that is on the brink of destruction...
::'''Zhongshan:''' Are you talking about the one that has returned to the IPC's economical sphere recently? Ya... Yaloli-8?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's an isolated doomsday city called Belobog!
::'''Zhongshan:''' Belobog? I think I've heard of it before! Are you talking about the planet that has returned to the IPC's economical sphere recently? Ya... Yaloli-8?
:'''Zhongshan:''' How intriguing. It is said that the planet was never heard from again after it was struck by a large-scale disaster.
:'''Zhongshan:''' If mechanical lifeforms were present on such locations, most of them will be troubled with technological regression. In that scenario, they can be counted as ferocious and endangered!
:'''Zhongshan:''' Your idea is promising, but there's a problem &mdash; this thing isn't a plant!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The word "plant" has a broad definition...
:'''Zhongshan:''' Hmm... I know where you're going with this! We can use a broad definition of plants to include mechanical creatures!
:'''Zhongshan:''' Since you proposed this idea, you must know where a rare rob&mdash; no, a rare mechanical creature &mdash; from Belobog can be acquired, right?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Who should I turn to if I wanna purchase Belobogian mechanical creatures? Serval, maybe. After all, she owns a workshop.)

:'''Serval:''' Mechanical lifeforms? Strategic partner? Hahaha, interesting choice of words.
:'''Serval:''' Before taking these scrap metals with you, I must ask you a question, and I'll take your answer as the advanced payment. Why are you two interested in the technology of Belobog?
----
:'''Serval:''' Treat the machines in Belobog as endangered creatures and release them to a faraway world in order to "accumulate merits"?
:'''Serval:''' ...Hahahaha! Being isolated in Belobog for so long, it's hard for me to accept such a novel idea.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you mean the idea of releasing machines...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you mean the idea of accumulating merits...?
:'''Serval:''' Everyone defines machines and living things differently. About releasing the machines... If it's to protect certain animals from being harmed, then I can understand.
:'''Serval:''' However, the idea of pleasing the Aeon through such actions is quite bold. Does it matter to Aeons how humans behave?
:'''Serval:''' Is there someone up there who constantly reviews the morality of our actions? Will we get our points deducted when we hurt a living thing and gain points when we rescue one?
:'''Serval:''' I'm afraid it's a sign of arrogance for humans to think that their actions are that important.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I agree.
::'''Zhongshan:''' That's what I think too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps Yaoshi really does care about what humans do...
::'''Zhongshan:''' Exactly. Don't forget about those Aeons who are particularly interested in humans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't this place protected by the Amber Lord?
::'''Serval:''' In my opinion, this city was able to survive the Eternal Freeze only because the remnants of the Architects made good use of the technology left behind by their ancestors.
::'''Serval:''' Of course, using phrases like "we have the blessing of Qlipoth" in teaching materials and speeches is a good way to inspire everyone.
:'''Serval:''' Anyways. I don't expect the opinion of a mere mechanic like me to hold sway over the Unshackled.
:'''Serval:''' Since you regard these machines as living things, you need to at least administer treatment and bring them back to life.

:'''Zhongshan:''' Things are slightly better than I thought... The technology used in these automatons is archaic... Oh, sorry Miss Serval, I mean to say that it is vintage.
:'''Zhongshan:''' As the presiding physician, I can't do all the work by myself.
:'''Zhongshan:''' (Trailblazer), I require your assistance. See those override modules I brought? Try to remove the casing of the automatons and search for the right port to connect with the modules.

:----
::'''Benna:''' This isn't what I expected from you!
::'''Benna:''' Mechanical creatures are everywhere, and the sky is full of those cycranes. Didn't you bring a Diting with you the last time you were here? In what sense are they endangered species?
::'''Benna:''' Besides, you two are required to solve the food chain issue among us to pass the newcomer trial... How can these mechanical creatures solve that problem?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Well, you don't know everything about these creatures. These weak and helpless mechanical creatures come from a planet verging on destruction named, um, Yaloli-8!
::'''Zhongshan:''' Miss Benna, I believe you must have heard of this planet before, since you're close with the trade reps of the IPC. I heard that the planet has just resumed its trade lately.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The place is no longer capable of manufacturing...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...mechanical babies like these!
::'''Benna:''' Oh, it breaks my heart to hear this. So... is this the last batch of mechanical lifeforms left behind by a declining civilization?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Exactly! They are an out-and-out endangered species! As new machines couldn't be made, we went all out to fix, I mean, to treat their lethal wounds. These little guys even fought valiantly to protect their human masters.
::'''Zhongshan:''' Miss Benna, you'll gain a lot of merits by releasing them and freeing them from the crisis and their imminent demise!
::'''Benna:''' I&mdash;I've got it. Indeed, these helpless babies are really worth releasing.
::----
:'''Benna:''' Oh, the more I look at these endangered darlings, the more fond I grow of them...

;(Talk to Heathmann)
:----
::'''Zhongshan:''' Heathmann, you don't seem too happy about this.
::'''Heathmann:''' I can understand the theoreticals, but... are you sure this kind of thing is a plant?
::'''Zhongshan:''' "Capable of photosynthesis, easy to cultivate, and has no excretion... Plants are the perfect living creature to be released." You said that, didn't you? Watch this.
::----
::'''Heathmann:''' This is, ahem, a certain device that controls this machine, isn't it? I don't understand how it is related to my definition of plants.
::'''Zhongshan:''' Well, it's an override module powered by a folded solar panel. This mechanical lifeform before you relies on solar energy, which is photosynthesis, to move around - just like the plants you love.
::'''Heathmann:''' ...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's easy to cultivate...
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Thanks for the reminder, (Trailblazer). When this individual runs out of energy, just let it enter the energy-saving mode and expose the solar panel to sunlight for a few days.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It has no excretion...
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Thanks for the reminder, (Trailblazer). This little one will never produce any unpleasant waste. It is purely natural and harmless.
::Heathmann wipes away the sweat on his forehead, looking distressed.
::'''Heathmann:''' So, it's a plant? This is unacceptable... It can't be a plant. Absolutely not! It has to at least look like one!
::'''Zhongshan:''' What does a plant look like? Must it have a huge trunk? Must it come with beautiful flowers? Or must it have a tuber buried in the ground?
::'''Zhongshan:''' Could you draw me a picture of a plant so that I can fix the appearance of this lifeform behind you?
::'''Heathmann:''' I... um... think you've got a point...
::'''Zhongshan:''' So, how did we do in this newcomer trial...
::'''Heathmann:''' It's a pass! I'm fine with this.
::----
:'''Heathmann:''' Machines are plants... Plants are machines... Eh? It sounds a bit off... Forget it...

;(Talk to Tonya)
:----
::'''Tonya:''' Mechanical... creatures. That's a whole new way to look at this matter. Still, I must say the technology used to manufacture them is too outdated!
::'''Tonya:''' I think I said before that the Unshackled should endeavor to free powerful beasts from human captivity! We must stop hunting for falcons and holding dog fights! Let them unleash their vitality in nature!
::'''Tonya:''' These primitive mechanical creatures are poor, weak, and sickly! Every joint of theirs trembles and the bolts on their casings threaten to pop out as they move.
::'''Zhongshan:''' Alas... I guess we have to show you some proof for you to believe us. Automatons, attack (Trailblazer) now!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ???
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Listen, now is the perfect time to show Miss Tonya how powerful these mechanical lifeforms are.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you let the automatons attack her instead?
:::'''Zhongshan:''' Are you in your right mind? Miss Tonya is a Benevolent One of the Unshackled! How can we make her suffer when she has accumulated so many merits?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do I deserve to be beaten up?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You really know how to pick a fight, don't you?

:::'''Benna:''' When we first met each other, we promised to do good together. Now, they've finally shown their true colors!
