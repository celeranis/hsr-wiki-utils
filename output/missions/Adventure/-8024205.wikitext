::Seeing this human and trashcan engaged in heated conversation, you can't help but be curious about what common language a trashcan could have with a Silvermane Guard Intelligence Officer.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you two talking about?
::'''Pela:''' (Trailblazer), long time no see! Welcome back to Belobog!
::'''Pela:''' I was just having a fascinating conversation with Pony. It turns out that we like a lot of the same works, and he even generously gifted me an autographed painting... I never thought I'd see fresh new works from such an obscure fandom. I'm so happy!
::'''Litter Pony:''' I should be the one thanking you for taking my recommendation, Miss Pela. What were we talking about just now? Oh, that's right, we were discussing the Magic of Friendship.
::'''Pela:''' There was once a popular anime that was all about using the Magic of Friendship to save the world: The characters would set out on exciting adventures with their best friends, and could also wield wonderful magical techniques...
::'''Pela:''' I actually... wrote a few fanfics about this anime, too. I never imagined that this kind of magic really existed!
::'''Pela:''' If it's possible, I would love the chance to... experience this for myself. Please tell me how I can use this Magic of Friendship!
::'''Litter Pony:''' That will not be a problem for you, Miss Pela! It's time to test Miss Pela's Proof of Friendship. What do you think a girl like her should do...?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Share her fanfics with her friends.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Become a magical girl with her friends!
::Pela shyly shows a fanfic she wrote &mdash; it's a story of her and her good friend Lynx becoming magical girls of Belobog together.
::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains Pela's Magic of Friendship.
::'''Pela:''' Is that all I needed to do?
::'''Pela:''' This is my... Magic of Friendship?
::'''Litter Pony:''' That's right! Now, you are a true magical girl, Miss Pela! It's time for you to join the real battlefield and defeat these "Betweenwhere intruders" by my side!
