:'''Theme Park Employee:''' Huh. If it isn't our esteemed guest. I finally found you.
:'''Theme Park Employee:''' I gotta say, after seeing your work, the production crew of the ''Way of the Wolf'' had to admit they couldn't compete with the pulse-pounding content you made even as paid employees!
:'''Theme Park Employee:''' The crew has been putting their focus on filming more interesting extra stories, with hopes of giving devoted and talented guests like yourself more room for expression!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Great!
::'''Theme Park Employee:''' Haha, I knew you'd like it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to keep working for free?
::'''Theme Park Employee:''' Don't put it that way. Think of it as "user-generated content." We're selling a creative experience!
:'''Theme Park Employee:''' Alright, go try it out. This story is reaching its climax... the battle against Boss Stone is absolutely thrilling!
