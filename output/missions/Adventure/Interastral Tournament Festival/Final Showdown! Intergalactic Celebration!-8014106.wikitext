:{{A|VO side1 ytzx bronya 103.ogg}} '''Bronya:''' We've been disconnected from the rest of the universe for far too long, but I really believe the festival could be our chance to reconnect with other worlds again. It's important as a host that I make all guests feel welcome.

:{{A|VO side1 ytzx natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...but after seeing it for myself, I can totally see why people are so taken in by it.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx natasha 104.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' This game allows people to work on themselves, or form strong bonds by teaming up with others. Harmless rivalry is a great way for people to settle their differences.

:{{A|VO side1 ytzx guinaifen 139.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' I don't think I've ever been this far away from the Xianzhou before! Who'd have thought I'd be hopping star systems only to wind up on this cold, icy planet?
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx guinaifen 140.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' You know, this place kinda reminds me of home... Not the Luofu, my real home. Barren, icy, jagged shards sticking out everywhere... I guess nothing really beats the Luofu, huh?
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx guinaifen 141.ogg}} '''Guinaifen:''' Oops, there I am rambling on again... I almost forgot you're still in the middle of a tournament! Good luck! I can't wait to see what you're gonna pull off next!

;(Talk to Seele)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx seele 101.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Oh, hey, it's you guys. That was some performance just now.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx seele 102.ogg}} '''Seele:''' I've been keeping an eye on the crowds &mdash; this festival has created quite the buzz in Belobog... Accidents tend to happen in these situations, so it's crucial to have someone keeping an eye out at all times.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx seele 103.ogg}} '''Seele:''' But things are going well &mdash; you guys pulled off a win, and everyone's happy. You've got quite a few die-hard fans in Belobog, you know. If you guys had been knocked out of the competition, there's no telling what they might have done.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx seele 104.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Anyway, I should get back to work... Here's hoping you keep on winning.

;(Talk to Silver Wolf)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx silverwolf 136.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' As you can see, due to certain reasons... I couldn't be here in person. Looks like I'm attending the rest of the tournament as a hologram.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx silverwolf 137.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' We're not the best of friends, that's no secret, but for the sake of the event, how about we pause the drama? I'd rather soak in the atmosphere and enjoy myself.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx silverwolf 138.ogg}} '''Silver Wolf:''' When it comes to gaming, things like race, lineage, allegiance, destiny, beliefs... they're all insignificant. It's good to remember that.

;(Talk to Gepard)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gepard 101.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' There you are. That last showdown was intense &mdash; it reminded me of my own time competing in the Silvermane Guards' martial contests.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gepard 102.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Unfortunately, my duty as Captain comes with pressing tasks &mdash; I'm afraid I can't partake in the fun... but I have given Officer Pela a well-deserved day off. She's normally swamped with work, so this is the perfect chance for her to relax.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gepard 103.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Seeing everyone enjoying themselves brings me great satisfaction... Still, my gut tells me something's happening below the surface... Are these visitors from beyond the sky really doing us a favor by bringing this kind of entertainment to Belobog?
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gepard 104.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...Apologies, this isn't the best time to discuss such matters. Let's focus on the festive spirit for now. I wish you the best of luck.

;(Talk to Clara)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx clara 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 ytzx clara 101 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' {{MC|m=Big brother|f=Big sister}}, it's you!
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx svarog 101.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' We meet again, outsider. Your previous contest was highly engaging. Congratulations to you both.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx clara 102.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog has been calculating the odds...
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx svarog 102.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' At one point, your chance of victory decreased to 14.93%, yet you successfully managed to change the course of a detrimental situation through strategic adjustment. It is evident that you have the potential for championship contention.

;(Talk to Giovanni)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx giovanni 265.ogg}} '''Giovanni:''' Ready yourselves, you two. While this {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|elite player}} hasn't made her appearance yet, she's unquestionably keeping an eye on you both.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx giovanni 266.ogg}} '''Giovanni:''' Given your strength and resolve, I firmly believe you won't have any major obstacles in your way...
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx giovanni 267.ogg}} '''Giovanni:''' Nevertheless, life is full of uncertainties. To fulfill your destiny, one must continuously seek to improve themselves!
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx giovanni 268.ogg}} '''Giovanni:''' Alright, let's leave it at that for now... I want you both to be well-prepared for the final.

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx himeko 101.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' That duel just now was pretty intense. When you dealt the winning blow, not even Mr. Yang could control his excitement. You should've seen him leap out of his chair.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I'm always wary of the IPC's products, but there's no denying they know how to put on a show. The atmosphere here is magical, I have to remind myself it's just a game.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Opportunities like this don't come around every day, so I hope you enjoy it. After all, trailblazing isn't just about the challenges &mdash; relishing the fun of the journey is just as important.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx welt 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 ytzx welt 101 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Welcome back, (Trailblazer) and March. I watched the entire duel, and I have to say what you did out there was spectacular.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx welt 102.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Games like these always stir up childhood memories. I remember watching similar TV shows back when I was just a kid.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Sorry, getting a bit nostalgic here. I hear the grand final is up next, I hope you knock it out of the park.
