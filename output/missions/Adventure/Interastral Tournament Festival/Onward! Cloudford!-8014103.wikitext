To be honest, we don't actually know where (Warp Trotter/Trotter/Bubbles/Puffball/Ivory Menace/Chunky Chops/Turbo Trotter/Trotterlord) came from either. They're not your average Aether Spirit. (Warp Trotter/Trotter/Bubbles/Puffball/Ivory Menace/Chunky Chops/Turbo Trotter/Trotterlord) has their own personality!
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 314.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We swooped in and rescued them from the clutches of the IPC, and then off we went on our adventure together... We're hoping to unravel their origins during the tournament.

:{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 316.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No need to apologize, Master Gongshu! I'm sure we'll figure out the truth behind (Warp Trotter/Trotter/Bubbles/Puffball/Ivory Menace/Chunky Chops/Turbo Trotter/Trotterlord) sooner or later!

:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gongshu 118.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' That reminds me... Have you two ever crossed paths with a peculiar fellow that goes by the name of Giovanni? He's an outsider with a fondness for wearing masks. He tasked me with delivering a message to the pair of you...
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gongshu 119.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' He asked me to mention a certain "elite player" &mdash; someone who once stormed the championship and kicked up quite the fuss in the gaming world.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 317.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh... him again? I wonder why Mr. Giovanni didn't tell us face to face when he had the chance?
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx gongshu 120.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' I'm just as puzzled. But alas, I'm merely a messenger. The subtleties within the words, I imagine, are for you two to decipher.
:{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 318.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I understand... Thanks, Master Gongshu!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you, Master Gongshu!
::{{A|VO side1 ytzx gongshu 121.ogg}} '''Master Gongshu:''' No need for formalities! 'Tis a trifle.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He's just urging us to pick up the pace.
::{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 322.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I mean... it's possible. But I can't help but wonder why he's so keen for us to speed up.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He just wants us to be well-prepared for upcoming battles.
::{{A|VO side1 ytzx mar7th 323.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah... you could be right about that. Is he convinced we'll run into the elusive "elite player," or something?
