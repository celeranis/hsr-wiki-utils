===Question Topaz's Support Squad===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Topaz's Support Squad just don't know when to give up. They're more unyielding than actual boulders.<br />But before you stomp them into the earth again, maybe it's wise to get a few things cleared up first.}}

===Go to the indicated area and pass the trial===

Still, blowing things up is a form of art, right?}}
