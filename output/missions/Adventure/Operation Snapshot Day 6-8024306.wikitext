;(Talk to Randolph)
:'''Randolph:''' Hey, (Trailblazer), great news! Thanks to your help, my research data is almost complete. If this research is successful, it will be a huge help to the Xianzhou people.
:'''Randolph:''' As for you, my friend, I would never deny you the payment I promised for your invaluable assistance.
:'''Randolph:''' But first, let's take care of the final photography session!

:'''Randolph:''' (Trailblazer), I really don't know how to thank you! The data collection is almost complete! It's time to get started on my thesis!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are your plans from here?
:'''Randolph:''' I've bought a ship ticket back to Penacony, but I will be around the Luofu for a while before I return. You can come and see me whenever you like.
:'''Randolph:''' From here it's just endless experiments and thesis writing until the deadline. It may be a long time until I can go trashcan diving again, which is a real shame.
:'''Randolph:''' (Trailblazer), as a fellow enthusiast, you must take on my share of the trashcan diving, too! May you enjoy your wildest fan-trash-ies!
