:'''Wallace:''' That's the watch Lord Simon gave me as a gift! I was just wondering where it had gone. Thank you so much.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So no recompense for returning the watch to you?
::'''Wallace:''' Why, yes, of course. I, Wallace, will never mistreat a friend!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, you aren't even slightly curious about how it got lost?
::'''Wallace:''' Not really. It's just an artifact left behind by the third Supreme Guardian. Won't be that big of a loss anyway.
::'''Wallace:''' Nevertheless, since you are the one who returned it to me, I will reward you handsomely as promised. I, Wallace, will never mistreat a friend!
:'''Wallace:''' This is the reward I prepared for you. Please enjoy.
