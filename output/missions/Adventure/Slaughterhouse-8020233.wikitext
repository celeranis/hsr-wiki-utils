:'''Singler:''' This Family attendant named Hamilton, his writing indicates much anxiety. The Family must have assigned some secret mission to him &mdash; his name would be struck off if he failed the mission, or worse... his head!

:'''Singler:''' Hmm... That attendant, Hamilton, entered the hotel in the Dreamscape, and the people around him started looking at him funny...
:'''Singler:''' I now have ample reason to believe that this attendant's experiences must be related to the Reverie's shutdown. It doesn't matter what secret assignment it was that The Family gave him, he definitely didn't manage to complete it...
:'''Singler:''' ...Or this place wouldn't be in this state now, would it?

:'''Singler:''' Siobhan... This name isn't familiar to me.
:'''Singler:''' But in the journal, it's pretty obvious that Hamilton admires that woman. If it is as he said, this Siobhan wields authority second only to the head in the Iris Family...
:'''Singler:''' ...Which means she must be the one who gave Hamilton the mission. But what exactly did the mission entail? Erasing a guest's memories? Suppressing the anomalies in the Dreamscape? Finding the source of the monster propagation? The notes reveal nothing on this...
:'''Singler:''' Honestly, I'm getting a little impatient. I don't know who this Hamilton guy is in the real world, but I think he's got the potential to be one of the Riddlers.
:'''Singler:''' But since we're already here, it'd be a waste to give up now... Let's try one more time, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}? I think you're very curious about how all this will unfold as well...
