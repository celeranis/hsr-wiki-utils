:'''Lady:''' I beg your pardon. I did not intend to keep it concealed from you, I merely wished to... bring you a surprise.
:'''Lady:''' I have heard of a skilled drinksmith at the lounge, and I desired to pay homage to your greatness. Hence, I came here intending to learn how to craft delicious beverages. Please, I implore you, do not be angered with me.
:'''Lady:''' During your expedition, I gathered numerous accounts detailing your magnificent achievements.
:'''Lady:''' "...Behold! Which great hero led the Sweet Dreams Troupe to triumph against the Trashcan Kingdom?"
:'''Lady:''' "...Which hero trampled the presumptuous Tatalov beneath their feet and raised the banner of freedom and equality?"
:'''Lady:''' "We inquire, who is it? The soda bottles reply: It's His Excellency, Marshal Tick-Tock!"
:'''Lady:''' "We inquire, who is it? The billboards reply: It's His Excellency, Marshal Tick-Tock!"
:'''Lady:''' "We inquire, who is it? Replies the entire Dreamscape: It's His Excellency, Marshal Tick-Tock!"
:'''Melancholy:''' Me, too! Me too! I just wrote a poem for you. Please enjoy it!
:'''Melancholy:''' Behold, the renowned General Tick-Tock! In battle invincible, wisdom profound! Valiant and skilled, a warrior's might! Conquering his foe Tatalov, with his valorous light!...
:'''Tin Man:''' Hahahahahahaha. Such adulation! I was unaware that my renown had spread so far and wide, yet it is only befitting!
:'''Tin Man:''' However, let me enlighten you: That drinksmith is unsuitable. She is but an orphan I took in. She may tend to the tables, yet her ability to create anything of interest is doubtful.
:'''Tin Man:''' If you doubt my words, you...
:'''Siobhan:''' ...G&mdash;Good evening, Mr. Tick-Tock.
:'''Tin Man:''' Looks like you've failed to take heed of the lessons I taught you. When you speak, bow your head, extend your hands, and look up to me!
:'''Tin Man:''' How often have I instructed you to display courtesy to the guests!? But have you ever complied?
:'''Siobhan:''' I... I beg your pardon for my transgression. I've newly arrived at the lounge, and I'm unfamiliar with the rules here. I implore your pardon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hey! Something is definitely wrong with her!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Just how much are you afraid of Siobhan?
:'''Tin Man:''' Alas, debating with such an ill-bred servant is a waste of time. Well, bring me beverages and showcase the extraordinary talents of the personal drinksmith in the esteemed service of Sir Tick-Tock, the Illustrious One!
