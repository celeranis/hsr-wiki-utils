:'''(Trailblazer):''' (I'm about to blow a fuse already just after serving two customers!)
:'''Siobhan:''' ...Is everything going alright?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...This is by far the most infuriating thing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel like teaching them a lesson!
:'''Siobhan:''' Haha, it's normal to feel that way in the beginning. Please don't take it to heart. They're just too affected by the nightmare that they can be a bit twisted.
:'''Siobhan:''' When things were all good in the past, they were a bunch of lovely and sensible kids.
:'''Siobhan:''' ...I really appreciate your hard work.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I haven't done much.
::'''Siobhan:''' I'm already grateful because you can accept these monsters and treat them as equals.
::I only lend my ear to them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I only lend my ear to them.
:'''Siobhan:''' And you respond to their issues well. I'm already grateful because you can accept these monsters and treat them as equals.
:'''Siobhan:''' Hmm, it's time to give you the "advanced lesson."
:'''Siobhan:''' A creative mind is key to mixing drinks. You need to come up with special blends based on the time and your customer's preferences.
:'''Siobhan:''' After I show you the ropes about "Free Mixing," you'll be able to craft drinks that aren't on the menu. This is something every drinksmith has to learn. Things could get boring if you keep dishing out the same recipes.
:'''Siobhan:''' For instance, I want a {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|large, extra sweet}} drink that brings back happy memories of my past...
:'''Siobhan:''' Nothing on the menu fits the requirements. What should you do now?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmm... Let me think about it.
:'''Siobhan:''' Don't panic. Let me show you what to do.
