:'''Siobhan:''' No. I hired (Trailblazer) because...
:'''Starlet:''' Their emotions are too intense to be calmed down by words.

:'''Amiky:''' What's wrong? You used to be so articulate, but when it really matters, why don't you say anything?

:'''Siobhan:''' Amiky... just shut up.
:'''Amiky:''' Hmm? Don't think you can order me around. I'm not listening.
:'''Amiky:''' Back then, there was a fool who gave up her acting career to become a drinksmith, and she always said with confidence that {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"Drinksmith is an art of communication."}}

:'''Siobhan:''' ...
:'''Siobhan:''' Could you please make me a drink now, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm happy to help.
:'''Siobhan:''' The ingredients are all on the lounge, the whole range. Feel free to use them. I won't charge you.
:'''Siobhan:''' Oh, I almost forgot. I'll pay you based on your workload if the customers are happy. The pay will satisfy you for sure.
:'''Siobhan:''' I'll be watching things from over there. Take it easy and dive into your work.

:'''Siobhan:''' ...Looks like you're quite used to peering into people's hearts, right?
:'''Siobhan:''' Honestly, revealing all of my innermost feelings... Hah, it feels pretty bad. It makes you feel vulnerable.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not quite skilled at it.
:'''Siobhan:''' Well, we can't pick and choose right now. Let's keep going. I haven't finished my drink yet.
:'''Siobhan:''' ...
:'''Siobhan:''' I'm an orphan, and I never knew who my parents were. I was abandoned at the Reverie Hotel before I was old enough to remember anything. Maeven, head of the Iris Family, adopted me and raised me as a future star.
:'''Siobhan:''' I once achieved great success in my acting career, but in the end... the stage wasn't for me. I just couldn't fit in.
:'''Siobhan:''' Life under the spotlight was too much for me... I despised being in front of the camera, the never-ending interviews, and the mind-numbingly boring scripts. I'd rather be with those monsters than in a rowdy crowd.
:'''Siobhan:''' I... long for a real family.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A real family... like the Sweet Dreams Troupe?
:'''Siobhan:''' Yeah. They're simple and innocent kids. Being with them brings me peace and happiness.

:'''Bloodhound Family Member:''' Don't threaten me! A Bloodhound Family member's will is resolute as steel!
:'''Siobhan:''' I don't mean to intimidate, but perhaps you could do the Iris Family a favor?
:'''Siobhan:''' This lady, Amiky, is the favorite daughter of Lady Maeven, head of the Iris Family, and she's now a superstar in the Dreamscape. Are you willing to listen to what I have to say for her sake?
:'''Amiky:''' Hey, you talk as if you're not a core member of the Iris Family. Do you really see yourself as just a random drinksmith?
:'''Siobhan:''' These monsters aren't aggressive at all. As you can see, a little scare is enough to frighten them. They won't pose a threat to the guests' safety.
:'''Siobhan:''' What's more, (Trailblazer)'s recent actions have proven that they can be controlled.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yeah, I can prove that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those "monsters" are actually more reasonable than you guys.
:'''Siobhan:''' Even the Dreamjolt Troupe, corrupted by the Nightmare, can live in harmony with us. Those who are interested in those monsters and have visited the lounge will tell you the same thing.
