:'''Siobhan:''' Hey there...
:'''Siobhan:''' Didn't we already meet before? You should loosen up a bit. The place is quiet, but that's okay &mdash; we can say whatever we want here.
:'''Siobhan:''' Did your conversation with Gallagher last time go well? He might look like he doesn't care about anything, but he actually has a lot on his mind. Otherwise, he wouldn't be a regular here.
:'''Siobhan:''' My place offers nothing but joy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's cut to the chase.
::'''Siobhan:''' Oh, I see you like to be straightforward. It's good to keep things simple, but you might get on people's nerves for being too direct.
::'''Siobhan:''' ...I'm kidding. I like how pragmatic you are.
::Did you ask me out just to tell me that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you ask me out just to tell me that?
:'''Siobhan:''' What do you want to talk about, then?
:'''Siobhan:''' Chatting is just a way to get closer to each other. As long as the conversation fulfills its purpose, it doesn't matter what we actually talk about. Don't you think so?
:'''Siobhan:''' Alright, you seem more relaxed now. I invited you here because I needed your help.
:'''Siobhan:''' Are you interested in the art of mixing drinks, especially after seeing how well Gallagher does it? Something unexpected has come up, and I need to be away for a while. I'm looking for someone to take my place temporarily.
:'''Siobhan:''' I think you've got the talent to ace the job. What do you say?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why me?
::'''Siobhan:''' I just go with my gut. Must I have a reason for that?
::You've picked the right person.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've picked the right person.
:'''Siobhan:''' I've always had a good eye for talent, and I believe you'll be an awesome drinksmith.
:'''Siobhan:''' Come on and try it. Don't be nervous, I'll guide you step by step.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Show me how.
