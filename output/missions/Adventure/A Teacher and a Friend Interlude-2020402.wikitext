{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|update|Chengjie decides to complete Master Ryan's design and hopes you can accompany him while he works. You don't know if supervision like this can yield any result, but go ahead and do it anyway.<br />When someone requires supervision before they have the confidence to complete a task, that says a lot about that supervisee.}}

;(Talk to Chengjie)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 202040402-->)
::'''Chengjie:''' I... must do it.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Chengjie:''' You're finally here! I've been studying the design manuscript while waiting for you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't think you would really wait for me.
:::'''Chengjie:''' I'm disappointed to hear that. Since we parted ways at Stargazer Navalia, I've seen you as my close friend! How can I go away when I'm expecting a friend's visit?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How's it going with the manuscript?
::'''Chengjie:''' Honestly speaking, I was worried whether it would be meaningless to make a starskiff from a century ago at first.
::'''Chengjie:''' But now, I've realized my concern is unfounded, as Master Ryan's design is undoubtedly timeless. Even though the design is century-old, it still stands at the forefront of the trend. I'm so impressed!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Care to elaborate?
:::'''Chengjie:''' I can't understand it at all! The concept it uses is totally different from the one adopted by the modern starskiff designs!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure you wanna make it when you can't understand it?
::::'''Chengjie:''' My master is way better at this than me, so I'm not too surprised that I can't understand his work. I just need to spend more time studying it.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm worried you won't be able to complete it.
::::'''Chengjie:''' Thanks for your concern, but we can't give up so easily.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think you can make it...
:::'''Chengjie:''' The starskiff of Xianzhou is great, but the design is rather old-fashioned. I'm sure my master's design will bring about a revolution.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your master was a genius!
:::'''Chengjie:''' It's not enough that only you and I know how awesome Master Ryan is. The whole world should know of it.
::'''Chengjie:''' Sometimes, you just need to jump in to get your feet wet. While studying the manuscript, I'm interacting with my master in an attempt to get closer to his way of thinking.
::'''Chengjie:''' (Trailblazer), your presence really motivates me. Please drop by regularly to monitor my progress and encourage me!
::'''Chengjie:''' When I'm studying the manuscript, it feels as though my master has come back to life. I can feel him standing behind me, and guiding me in my work. Those heartwarming memories that have long faded away all surge back to my mind. Master Ryan, please give me more time!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I feel like I'm helping kids with their homework...
:::'''Chengjie:''' Your effort will pay off the day the starskiff is made! To commemorate our hard work, I'll engrave the name &mdash; "Ryan, Chengjie & (Trailblazer)" &mdash; on the ship.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Um... There's no one standing behind us, right?
:::'''Chengjie:''' Relax. It's just a figure of speech. There's nothing supernatural on Xianzhou.
::'''Chengjie:''' Here you go, this is the Immortal's Delight that I promised you. One cup a day, all work is just play.
