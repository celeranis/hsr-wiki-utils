:Even if you keep trying, what can you really do with a frozen trashcan?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take the entire trashcan away.
::Of course, the almighty Galactic Baseballer would not be deterred by a mere trashcan. You yank it out of the snow with all your might, its lid popping open.
::The trash spills out onto the ground behind you, and if it were sentient, it would likely glare at you with a grudge and a shudder.
::You have triumphed over the obstinate trashcan. As a reward for your resistance, you have acquired a bag... no, several bags of trash.
