===Pay your respects to the Statue of the High Elder{{subst:void|<!--800222201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|Mr. Xiyan says slowly: "There are strange fumes coming off the Statue of the High Elder, indicating that it is no simple stone. Perhaps it can guide (Trailblazer) to victory over the enemy and salvation for Scalegorge Waterscape."}}

===Find the malicious Mirage Echo{{subst:void|<!--800222202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|In Mr. Xiyan's story, the Statue of the High Elder in Scalegorge Waterscape comes to life, and even gives you all sort of trials to go through. Forget about the scientific realism of it all, it's pretty cool to talk with a statue.<br />The Statue of the High Elder asks you to help it get rid of a malicious Mirage Echo. Normally, Mirage Echoes can't and won't hurt people. But this is inside Mr. Xiyan's story. Anything is possible.}}

Now, the Statue of the High Elder is even asking you to... act as a midwife for the next high elder?<br />You are starting to feel this story has nothing to do with your own adventures anymore, but Mr. Xiyan thinks this is the compromise necessary for commercial success.}}
