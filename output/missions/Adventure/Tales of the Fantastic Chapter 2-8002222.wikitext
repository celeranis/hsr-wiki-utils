===Pay your respects to the Statue of the High Elder{{subst:void|<!--800222201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|Mr. Xiyan says slowly: "There are strange fumes coming off the Statue of the High Elder, indicating that it is no simple stone. Perhaps it can guide (Trailblazer) to victory over the enemy and salvation for Scalegorge Waterscape."}}

:{{DIcon|Loupe}} Statue of the High Elder
----
:'''???:''' Did you break into Scalegorge Waterscape to try and beg me for the power of the high elder? You're joking! Is this some kind of outworlder joke?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who's speaking?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where are you hiding?
:'''???:''' Up here! I'm right in front of you! Don't turn a blind eye to me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a statue?
:'''???:''' I am the statue of Yubie the high elder. Steeped in the essence of moonlight, I have taken consciousness.
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' You're an outworlder who doesn't even know who I am, yet you dare come here to claim the power of the high elder so rashly? Heh... You'll never get your hands on it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine, I don't even want it.
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Quitting so soon? I thought the Nameless were supposed to be tenacious and indomitable?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't you bend the rules this once, pleaaase~
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' If this was something that could just be "bent," then the Vidyadhara wouldn't find ourselves in our current predicament.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A statue &mdash; that can talk!
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Fine! I foolishly believed that you, as Nameless, would be a well-traveled connoisseur but it seemed you were rather finicky, shall we say!
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Sigh... But then again I'm nothing more than a statue. I can hardly lecture you.
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' What about... I set a trial for you. Pass it, and you'll gain my recognition. I'll then grant you whatever your wish is.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Another trial?
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Without a trial, how would I know whether you were worthy of my help?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wish to be rich!
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Heh... Now's not the time for making wishes. We can talk about this again once you complete the trial.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My wish is for three more wishes!
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' I'm not some genie in a lamp. We can talk about this again once you complete the trial.
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Centuries ago, Dan Feng the high elder got led astray in life, triggering the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae and leaving countless Mirage Echoes filled with hatred throughout Scalegorge Waterscape.
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' A few of them still cling to vicious hatred, causing all kinds of ruckus that's really starting to get to people. Please get rid of these ill-willed Mirage Echoes &mdash; that's the trial that I have for you.

===Find the malicious Mirage Echo{{subst:void|<!--800222202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|In Mr. Xiyan's story, the Statue of the High Elder in Scalegorge Waterscape comes to life, and even gives you all sort of trials to go through. Forget about the scientific realism of it all, it's pretty cool to talk with a statue.<br />The Statue of the High Elder asks you to help it get rid of a malicious Mirage Echo. Normally, Mirage Echoes can't and won't hurt people. But this is inside Mr. Xiyan's story. Anything is possible.}}

;(Talk to Vidyadhara Mirage Echo)
:'''Malicious Mirage Echo:''' I was supposed to be chosen as high elder... That cursed, cursed Dan Feng! It was he who stole my rightful power from me!

;(Talk to Vidyadhara Mirage Echo)
:'''Lamenting Mirage Echo:''' I've worked for the Realm-Keeping Commission for five hundred years, and I'll soon qualify to buy a townhouse in the Drifters Sanctum!
:'''Lamenting Mirage Echo:''' What a pity! After this disaster, my reincarnated body has to keep working...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This doesn't seem to be the one...

;(Talk to Vidyadhara Mirage Echo)
:'''Faint Mirage Echo:''' They always mock me for being nothing... How can I earn the respect of the Preceptors?
:'''Faint Mirage Echo:''' Why does my existence become visible every time a troublesome task presents itself?
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This doesn't seem to be the one...

;(Talk to Vidyadhara Mirage Echo)
:'''Chatty Mirage Echo:''' Office of Deep Sources document directory article 3632...
:'''Chatty Mirage Echo:''' The high elder's dream divinations? No, not this one. How have the Vidyadhara not figured out an automatic file management system yet for their massive library!? Tsk...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' This doesn't seem to be the one...

;(Talk to Vidyadhara Mirage Echo)
:'''Sorrowful Mirage Echo:''' Back when I was just an egg, I dreamed there was a little fox playing around in the water with me.
:'''Sorrowful Mirage Echo:''' When I grew up, I found her out there in the world, just as she was about to die of old age... Just the thought of that made me burst into tears.

:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' The grievances hanging over Scalegorge Waterscape have cleared a little... I think you have indeed completed the trial. You really do live up to the moniker of the Nameless...
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Now that you've completed the first trial, now it's time for the second trial.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just exactly how many trials are there now!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're making me do all the Thirteen Labors, aren't you?
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Don't worry. This will be your final trial.
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Before his imprisonment, Dan Feng buried all of his treasure deep within Scalegorge Waterscape. They say that before he set out, he spoke these words&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Rules are made to be broken!"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "I wish not for dominion, yet I cannot watch the common folks suffer!"
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' What's that about!?
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' Anyway, the second trial is to find the treasure, return it to its original owner, and reset the wheels of fate.
:{{Black Screen|(Trailblazer) found the high elder's secret treasure trove thanks to the statue's guidance.}}

:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' So I was right about you. Being able to complete these trials proves you a trustworthy person.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really? Sure you don't want a couple more trials?
::'''Yubie (Questionable):''' No, thanks. We're good.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well said! You sure have good taste, I'll give you that!
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' The truth always comes in threes. You may have passed the first two trials, but now comes the final and most important test &mdash; and please don't tell me that I'm not trusting...
:'''Yubie:''' Because this third trial is the answer which you seek &mdash; the power of the high elder.
:'''Yubie:''' We Vidyadhara naturally reincarnate in cyclical continuity. As the previous high elder has abdicated and undergone hatching rebirth, a new high elder will be reborn once more!
:'''Yubie (Questionable):''' I want you to find this Vidyadhara egg and deliver the rebirth of the new high elder. From then on, this new high elder will be your help, and support you in overcoming any hardships you may encounter.
