:You put great effort and strength into repairing its heart &mdash; or, core may be more accurate &mdash; and you feel satisfied with your work. However...
:As you look at it, it does not move; It does not look at you, but continues to just lie still.
:{{Color|fire|nobold=1|Suddenly, an inexplicable rage overcomes you}} &mdash;
:Look at it! Look at this useless thing! Lying around like a dying dog all weak and pathetic!
:It deserves punishment! It wasted your precious time and your kindness!
:You should give it a good kicking. Kick it until its busted shell is even more busted &mdash; that's right! Just like that, kick it... Hey, wait a second!
:Look, what is that... Aha! Looks like you must quell your rage for a moment... Look! As your last kick landed, something came flying out from inside the clock face!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' ...This is... a tape?
:You see a sudden flash of color before your eyes as if you were being shown a glimpse of something, yet you see nothing...
:A strange electric buzz reverberates through your mind as if you hear something, but you cannot make it out.
:One thing is certain, a single emotion... {{Color|fire|nobold=1|You are even more enraged}}. You feel a presence that you cannot sense lurking all around you... Greedy, thick, and ready to strike.
:You lower your head to look at the *tape* in your hands. The unsuspecting little object is emitting some kind of irresistible attraction, trying to pull you deeper into the mire. What will you do?
