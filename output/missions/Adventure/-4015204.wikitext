:'''Master Gongshu:''' Hahaha, great. The problem is solved once I saw you. Now I just like you more.
:'''Master Gongshu:''' *sigh* My foolish apprentices only make empty talk. Last time they actually asked me, "Master, do you think this aurumaton can push the comet back if it is equipped with heliobus energy thrusters?"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can it?
::'''Master Gongshu:''' Yes, it can. If we use this Luminflux Pyxis as a thruster, we can push a comet to wherever we want.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Boring.
::'''Master Gongshu:''' That's right. My apprentices are always thinking about some boring questions.
::'''Master Gongshu:''' Comets are not that heavy. If we use the Luminflux Pyxis as a thruster, we can push a comet to wherever we want.

:'''Master Gongshu:''' Not bad. The data collection for this experiment went well... Can I digress? What do you think of the shape of the aurumatons in our Artisanship Commission?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They look good.
::'''Master Gongshu:''' You think so? Some of my apprentices said that if aurumatons can be scaled to make ingenium dolls, we can make a fortune.
::'''Master Gongshu:''' But I doubt it. After all, they are too ugly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are a bit ugly.
::'''Master Gongshu:''' I feel so too. Isn't it just a mechanical puppet with a gate? I don't think anyone would buy it.

:'''Master Gongshu:''' I do have the Golden Cloud Toad and Illumination Dragonfish with me, but it is still not safe to do a weapon test here... In fact, the Cloud Knights have warned me several times before.
:'''Master Gongshu:''' It seems that I was wrong about my apprentices before. It's not that they didn't want to come, they just were not smart enough to evade the Cloud Knights and come to the Artisanship Commission.
:'''Master Gongshu:''' You're more reliable than them. I am going back now, you take care.
