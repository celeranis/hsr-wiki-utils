As a hero from beyond the sky, perhaps you may wish to continue your battle to eradicate all strife...<br />All strife will be brought to justice under the swift hand of the Galactic Baseballer! Though you have driven away the troublesome Strife Titan, something must have happened here... Go and ask the poor people you rescued for more information.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Survival, fortune, faith, honor, things they want to protect... Every warrior has a reason to fight to the death, and the Titankin that live for battle are no exception. Why would this enemy initiate a conflict against a city that they have no hope of defeating?<br />The Furiae Archer escaped with the caravan's goods. Go to Castrum Kremnos to find her, retrieve the stolen treasures, and maybe you will receive an answer to your questions.}}

Every warrior has a reason to fight to the death, and the Titankin that live for battle are no exception. Why would this enemy initiate a conflict against a city that they have no hope of defeating?<br />You hear two unfamiliar names from the mouth of this supposedly crazed warrior. Though finding the truth behind these names has nothing to do with your objective of finding the golden thread, it is also the duty of a Nameless to explore the unknown... At least it would be more interesting than finishing her off with a single blow. You didn't just take this job to get into fights after all, right?}}
