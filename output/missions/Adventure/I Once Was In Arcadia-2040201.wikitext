Every warrior has a reason to fight to the death, and the Titankin that live for battle are no exception. Why would this enemy initiate a conflict against a city that they have no hope of defeating?<br />You hear two unfamiliar names from the mouth of this supposedly crazed warrior. Though finding the truth behind these names has nothing to do with your objective of finding the golden thread, it is also the duty of a Nameless to explore the unknown... At least it would be more interesting than finishing her off with a single blow. You didn't just take this job to get into fights after all, right?}}
