::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock... What do I do, tick-tock...
::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock! Guest! Hello! I am Clockie! Welcome to Dreamville!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's wrong?

::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock! I am Clockie! Welcome to Dreamville...

:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock... What do I do, tick-tock...
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock! Guest! Hello! I am Clockie! Welcome to Dreamville!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I got a message from you...
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock? So you are the one helping out. I am ashamed...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You the one sending me these spam messages?
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock? It's not spam, just that my mechanical hands aren't great for using phones...
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, my dear guest, I'm sorry that you had to witness this uncouth sight of us Dream Tickers.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What exactly are you?
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, we're the Sweet Dreams Troupe of the Iris Family, outfitted as attendants in the image of the cartoon star Clockie, and are used to bring joy to our guests via our adorable aesthetics!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not adorable at all...
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock... There are myriad aesthetic tastes across the cosmos. Many of our guests love us.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look nothing like Clockie at all...
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock... I don't know what our creator was thinking either, but that was supposed to be the planned design!
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, our jobs are the most mundane among the Sweet Dreams Troupe &mdash; we have to repeat the same lines every day, and there are almost no chances of promotion or days off...
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Middle-management Dream Tickers like us fear that our subordinates will turn into the Dreamjolt Troupe, which is why we brought some building blocks to help them decompress.
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' But... But they all turned wonky after receiving the building blocks. Tick-tock, I've received too many guest complaints already!
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, if this keeps up, our entire department will be optimized... But a Dream Ticker told me that someone who could fix us showed up &mdash; and that's you, my dear guest!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you need any help?
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, yes! Since you can fix us, you must possess some extraordinary talent. Please help us!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me.
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, you're the kindest person ever! I'll have my subordinates prepare a token of appreciation for you!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Other people can't fix you?
::::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, our internal structures are very complicated. Your average Dreamweaver wouldn't even begin to know how to navigate them... They would only find an excuse to dispose of the faulty Dream Tickers to cover up their incompetence!
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Please look for the faulty Dream Tickers across the dreams. Tick-tock, and remember to bring those strange blocks back too!
:;(If {{cx}}<!--not during performance 802023102-->)
:::'''Dream Ticker Supervisor:''' Tick-tock, kind guest, I thank you for your compassionate act on behalf of all Dream Tickers!
