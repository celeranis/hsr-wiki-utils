:'''Peppy:''' Woof woof!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why'd you yell for me?
:The puppy nudges your hand with its fluffed head. You instinctively press the beacon button on its back.
:'''Peppy:''' (There is more than one Joy Filtration Set lost. As for the other set's whereabouts... I've found a clue.)
:'''Peppy:''' (Peppy and (Trailblazer) are the world's best detective duo! You'll help Peppy, right?)
:The puppy's sloppy tongue licks your hand, but seeing that you are unmoved, bites down on your glove and refuses to let go.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine, I'll play along.
::Peppy flashes a splendid smile at you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, we're the world's best!
::Peppy smiles at you, its tail wagging more profusely than before with happiness.
:'''Peppy:''' (Let's go!)

:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' Thank you for saving me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What was taken should be returned now.
::'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' You mean, that strange can?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hand over the Curio you stole as compensation.
::'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' What is a Curio?
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' Oh, you guys are talking about that dusty gray can of mine?
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' I've seen it before, but I didn't steal it. I don't even have the right to touch it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you mean?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If it wasn't you, then who stole it?
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' It was the butler.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who's the butler?
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' I saw it playing with that "can." It was fiercely protective with it too, and it wouldn't let me even glance at it.
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' That guy is a big fat liar. It said it was Ruan Mei's assistant, and that Ruan Mei dispatched it here to manage everyone.
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' My buddies and I were banished here because we doubted it... Such a shame that everyone else believed its lies.
:'''Peppy:''' (We have to find the butler and retrieve the Curio...)
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' You're looking for it? That's gonna be hard, I'm afraid. It controls access to and from the room, and it won't let you in.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you know about the butler?
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' That's all I know. But, my buddies have also interacted with it.
:'''Ruan Mei's Creation:''' It's a pity we all got scattered, or... You could go look for them &mdash; they might know something.

:'''Peppy:''' ((Trailblazer), regarding the butler situation, what do you think about all this?)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have no idea.
:'''Peppy:''' (...Ah, should we return and ask Miss Asta, woof?)

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then let's go!
