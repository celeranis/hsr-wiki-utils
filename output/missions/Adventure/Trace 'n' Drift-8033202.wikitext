===Use Sea Hunter Shark to advance through the first round of qualifiers{{subst:void|<!--803320201-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue|Boothill's car has great performance and a strong offense, I suppose this can somewhat soothe the unsettling feeling of having been strangely signed up for this competition... You decide to participate in the first round of qualifiers with it, and hope that the Galaxy Ranger's notorious reputation can scare off your opponents.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=SoulGlad™ Scorchsand Audition Venue|update|The Family is quite understanding, they know that you don't have a car of your own, so they swiftly made you an exclusive one. Who would have thought that you'll go against a familiar face from the space station in this round? Thankfully, they've never hidden their skills at racing, and you advanced with ease.}}

However, you vaguely remember her promise, she gave you a car today, and hopefully she won't forget what to give you tomorrow.}}
