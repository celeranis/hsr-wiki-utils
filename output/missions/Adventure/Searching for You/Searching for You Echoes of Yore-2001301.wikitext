{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Boulder Town|According to the robot's navigation plan, your next journey starts from Boulder Town. Hearing that, you cannot help but think of old friends...}}

:'''Little Robot:''' Arrived at designated location. Synchronizing historical data...
:'''Little Robot:''' Astral Express data shows that the Nameless previously assisted a legendary organization of heroes &mdash; Alteration &mdash; underground organization known as "The Moles" in completing a cargo delivery mission here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened back then? Who am I supposed to be looking for?
::'''Little Robot:''' I have found multiple related data items: "The most recent assistance was completed on ▉▉." "The Astral Express helped to optimize The Moles' transportation routes." "A total of ▉▉ cargo deliveries have been completed."
::'''Little Robot:''' The party involved who is currently available is: Julian. As their education level is comparatively low, I suggest a face-to-face meeting with them to learn more.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I personally helped with that, too!
::'''Little Robot:''' Records regarding your personal involvement have been found. Data shows that your performance while assisting was outstanding, and you received great praise from The Moles' members.
::'''Little Robot:''' Suggestion: Search for "Julian" before heading to the clinic. You left a deep impression on him. There is a 0% chance that he will refuse to communicate with you.
:'''Little Robot:''' Route generation complete. Please proceed to the designated area and contact "Julian."

===Talk to Julian{{subst:void|<!--200130102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Boulder Town|update|Knowing that you are going to meet with your old friends in the Moles, you feel a rush of excitement &mdash; as well as a pang of regret... If you knew you were coming, you'd have brought a few more exercise books...}}

:'''Julian:''' *sobbing*...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Julian, long time no see!
::'''Julian:''' *Cries* (Trailblazer), if only you were here... *cries*
::(Ask Julian what is going on)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Ask Julian what is going on)
:'''Julian:''' Th&mdash;The deliveries... I&mdash;I don't wanna talk about it! *Cries*...
:'''Natasha:''' Oh, (Trailblazer). It's you. Did you need to speak with Julian about something? He's a little out of sorts at the moment, so please try not to get him riled up.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I hope I didn't upset him.
:'''Natasha:''' *Sigh* The school distributed a new patch of practice question booklets yesterday. He took a shortcut to deliver them to some of his classmates' homes. I have no idea what he saw on the way, but he's been like this ever since.
:'''Natasha:''' Oleg is extremely concerned about this. He and the Silvermane Guards patrolled the area for the whole night, but they didn't find anything.
:'''Natasha:''' I gave him a routine inspection. Fortunately, he seems completely healthy. From the looks of it, I'd say he was exposed to some kind of mental shock.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me speak with Julian.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I help him somehow?
:'''Natasha:''' Julian does tend to be a little timid, but I've never seen him this scared before. He loves being with the Astral Express Crew. Maybe he would be willing to talk to you...
:'''Julian:''' {{MC|f=Sister|m=Brother}}... Waaa... I'm sorry, I'm so useless... I've been a burden on everyone again...
:Julian is crying so much you can barely make out what he is saying.
:'''Little Robot:''' Emotional abnormality detected in target. Activating support function.
:'''Little Robot:''' Your current heart rate is 127 BPM and you are hyperventilating. Please match your breathing to the rhythm of the light displayed on my screen.
:'''Little Robot:''' Haa... Phew... Haa... Phew...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're amazing, little robot!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that really going to help?
:'''Julian:''' ...I&mdash;I feel a little better now.
:'''Little Robot:''' Please maintain that breathing rate. Furthermore, there is something that I must tell you &mdash; according to data from the Astral Express' previous visits to Belobog, your previous transport missions' success rate is 96.7%. Medical supplies delivered by you have saved the lives of 27 citizens.
:'''Little Robot:''' &mdash; Calculating from your current age, only 0.0003% of your peers have achieved this level of success. You are not "useless." In fact, you are a great emergency worker.
:'''Julian:''' I... I just did what needed to be done...
:'''Natasha:''' I had no idea this robot was trained in psychological treatment.
:'''Little Robot:''' This is a learning outcome based on the Express Crew's behavior patterns.
:Julian takes a deep breath and stops crying.
:'''Julian:''' Yesterday... When I was approaching the Fragmentum, I was going to take a shortcut. But... I looked up... I looked up and I saw them.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Them? Who?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What did you see?
:'''Julian:''' It... It was a group of Silvermane Guards... Their uniforms were torn to pieces and they were covered in wounds. I thought it was strange. I've never seen them in town before.
:'''Julian:''' They kept asking me: "Are our supplies here?" I was so scared. I grabbed my book bag and ran for it. But, when they saw me running, they started to chase me...
:'''Julian:''' Those Silvermane Guards... They... They didn't... They didn't look like they were alive!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are ghosts of the past that roam the Fragmentum.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's fine. You're safe now that I'm here.
:'''Natasha:''' The Fragmentum... I've heard about miners who saw visions of the past while being around the Fragmentum. They even said that they saw Silvermane Guards who were posted there a hundred years ago.
:'''Natasha:''' But it doesn't rule out the possibility that someone is just playing tricks... But why would they target Julian?
:'''Julian:''' I... I don't know... Waaa! They kept chasing me all the way to the end of the alleyway! I'm too scared to go outside now. Just thinking about their looks makes me go... go...
:'''Natasha:''' Wait, I have an idea. Maybe... Maybe allowing Julian to see their true form would be the best way to help him overcome his fear.
:'''Natasha:''' What do you think, (Trailblazer)? Those miners saw the echoes that linger around the Fragmentum, and they came back unharmed. Surely that shows that the phantoms are not going to hurt anyone.
:'''Natasha:''' But if it's someone deliberately causing trouble... (Trailblazer) will be able to stop them before they can do anything bad.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Facing your fear is the only way to defeat it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's no need to scare the kid like that.
:'''Natasha:''' Julian, do you want to give it a go? (Trailblazer) and I will be by your side the whole time. We won't leave you no matter what. Take us to that passage with the Fragmentum and maybe we can rid you of this nightmare?

;(Talk to Silvermane Lieutenant)
:'''Stern Silvermane Guard:''' I have never seen this fighting style before... No, this is not right... You are not our enemies. You are...
:'''Natasha:''' We are Belobog citizens. The Supreme Guardian sent us to find you &mdash;
:'''Julian:''' ...Huh?
:'''Stern Silvermane Guard:''' The Supreme Guardian?
:'''Natasha:''' Look, this is the badge from the Silvermane Guards' Boulder Town garrison. I am the town's doctor.
:'''Despairing Silvermane Guard:''' Thank goodness, we're saved! Long live the Supreme Guardian! The Supreme Guardian must have sent them to bring us supplies!
:'''Stern Silvermane Guard:''' ...So that's what's going on! We are squad seven. I am the commanding officer, and we have been ordered to guard this place. This area is extremely dangerous, and those with no business here must stay away for their own safety.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What supplies do you need?
::'''Despairing Silvermane Guard:''' Ammunition... food... medical supplies... everything. We're out of everything.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How long have you been stationed here?
::'''Stern Silvermane Guard:''' We have held out here for seven months. Our ammo supplies are dwindling, and the storehouse is empty. We've gone hungry for... I don't know how many days now... But we have never abandoned our post.
:'''Natasha:''' You have already completed your mission. You can rest now...
:'''Stern Silvermane Guard:''' ...Hah. Then it seems like our perseverance till the bitter end did achieve something...
:'''Despairing Silvermane Guard:''' May the flame of Belobog never die... May our people... enjoy eternal happiness...

:The Silvermane Guards fade into sparkling dust and gradually disappear...
:'''Julian:''' So... So that's what happened.
:'''Natasha:''' Do you understand now? They're not scary. They're our ancestors who fought until their last breath to protect us.
:'''Natasha:''' Transporting goods, helping others, making sure others stay alive... The work you are doing now is also an extension of these Guards' will. They would never harm you.
:'''Julian:''' Okay... I understand now. I'm not scared anymore. But... Will they ever appear again?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are gone forever.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I... I'm not sure about that.
:'''Julian:''' Really!? That's such a shame... Hook gave me half a bag of candy. I've been saving it all this time, and now I want to share it with these soldiers...
:'''Natasha:''' I will make an application to the Supreme Guardian when we go back and see if we can find out their names. I'd like to set up a monument here as a memorial to these brave soldiers.
:'''Natasha:''' That way, any time you come here and see the monument, it'd be like seeing these soldiers again. As long as they exist in your memory, they will never die.
:'''Julian:''' I&mdash;I want to tell this story to everyone in The Moles! I want them all to come here and say hello to these nice guards!
:'''Julian:''' (Trailblazer), Natasha, thank you. If it weren't for you, I might have never figured out their story... *sobbing*...
:'''Natasha:''' You're all grown up now, Julian. No more crying like that, okay?
:'''Julian:''' Waaa! Waaa! O&mdash;Okay! I'm a big, strong man now!
:'''Little Robot:''' I feel like I have learned something, but I cannot detect any systems that require upgrading.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I never realized that you are also capable of further growth.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's quite normal for you to not understand emotions.
:'''Little Robot:''' Is that so? I suppose. I am a robot. I do not fully understand human emotions.
:'''Little Robot:''' But I have discovered an interesting phenomenon. It seems that everyone has "names." This seems to be the manifestation of some kind of concept that is more complex than a simple exchange of benefits.
:'''Little Robot:''' I have been thinking... Perhaps I could give myself a name? Something like... "Dumb-Dumb" or "Duh-Duh?" Based on the average intelligence quota of sentient creatures, these two names seem somewhat appropriate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They're horrible names! Don't put yourself down like that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I won't be using those names.
:'''Little Robot:''' There are already entries for "Dumb-Dumb" and "Duh-Duh" in the space station terminal records. Registration could not be completed. You are right, I cannot use these names.
:'''Little Robot:''' Let us focus on the next segment of our journey &mdash; your next stop is Aurum Alley on the Xianzhou Luofu.
