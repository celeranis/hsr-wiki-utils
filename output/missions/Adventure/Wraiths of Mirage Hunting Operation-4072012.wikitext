{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|The Realm-Keeping Commission has ascertained that the "cloudhymn magic imitation" is a Warp Trotter's doing. Following this, you and the Realm-Keeping Commission have decided to go on a "hunt."<br />The Realm-Keeping Commission has placed baited traps all over Healer's Market, and they hope you can capture the Trotter causing the abnormalities...}}

:'''Guangjin's voice:''' *electronic voice* The residents at the Healer's Market have been evacuated. Now it's time to show off what you're made of!
:'''Guangjin's voice:''' *electronic voice* We've detected a lot of monsters near the Healer's Market. They must have manifested with the cloudhymn magic anomalies, but I'm pretty sure you know well how to handle them.
:'''Guangjin's voice:''' *electronic voice* As another reminder, the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Reverberation Generator}} will help you locate the monsters. Please use it wisely.
:'''Guangjin's voice:''' *electronic voice* And just a heads-up, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|don't engage those monsters}}. Our main focus is the Warp Trotter. We'll stay in contact remotely. Please be careful.

;(Talk to Guangjin)
:'''Guangjin:''' Finally, we've caught this Warp Trotter... or rather, you've caught it!
:'''Guangjin:''' I think the anomaly here will subside soon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, the "Hunting Operation" was a success?
::'''Guangjin:''' A great success!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...This "operation" was hilariously easy.
::'''Guangjin:''' I understand what you must be thinking.
::'''Guangjin:''' "I laugh at the Trotter's poor tactics and the abomination's lacking guile. Were I them, I'd set an invisible creature at the narrow pass, and catch the hunters by surprise."
::'''Guangjin:''' This operation is far from simple. Maybe it's just because you're too skilled.
:'''Guangjin:''' However, it's impossible for only one Warp Trotter to create such a large-scale anomaly, if you understand what I mean.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...So, there are more Warp Trotters out there?
::'''Guangjin:''' Yeah, a lot more...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't understand what you mean.
::'''Guangjin:''' We still have many more Warp Trotters to catch.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I suddenly feel like quitting.
::'''Guangjin:''' Not so fast. We still need to catch a lot more Warp Trotters.
:'''Guangjin:''' But here's the good news! We'll be able to catch them all in our next operation!
:'''Guangjin:''' Meet me at the Alchemy Commission if you're willing to help us all the way. But for now, please take this reward as a token of appreciation for all you've done.
