{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Dreamflux Reef|Dr. Blues, the Origami Bird staying in Dreamflux Reef, seems to be a bit different from the other birds. Go and see what is happening.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Dr. Blues)
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Hmm? This hat... Looks like you've found the {{Rubi|treasure|Legacy}} that the Watchmaker left behind.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Does this mean that his last wishes are fulfilled?
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Hmph...
:'''Dr. Blues:''' This Watchmaker sure is a stubborn one... planning such a gigantic plot and betting it all on someone else. I never thought he'd actually find the perfect ending after going around in such a huge circle.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' All right, now the Watchmaker's wishes have been fulfilled. That drunken hound can also probably retire with honor...
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ...And I'm the only bird left in this place again.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You don't intend to leave?
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Me? I'm an origami bird, don't you get it? The sort that can only appear in dreams.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Penacony does not welcome birds that can't tweet, which is why I trusted the Watchmaker's deception and built a new nest here. Later, he dragged a bunch of naysayers here, and this place became Dreamflux Reef.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ...To a certain extent, this is a grand haven, specifically sheltering poor souls who could neither fit into the Dreamscape, nor leave the dream.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You built Dreamflux Reef?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Birds can be Dreamweavers too?
:'''Dr. Blues:''' That's right. Treasure all this, for Penacony will be hard-pressed to produce another Dreamweaver as gifted as me. I...
:The bird before you suddenly goes mute. It is silent for a couple of seconds, and its demeanor turns aloof.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Forget it, it's none of your business.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' I'm very busy. Go find another unlucky soul to be your guide. Don't let me keep you.

;(Talk to Clockie)
:'''Clockie:''' Tick-tock, something's wrong with Dr. Blues!
:'''Clockie:''' It's completely different from when I saw it in Dreamville. It's missing something that an origami bird should have!
:'''Clockie:''' Not just that, it seems like there's another soul inside that paper body... Maybe Dr. Blues is no ordinary Origami Bird?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've got a point.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's hard to say...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew it!
:'''Clockie:''' Tick-tock... If we're to search for Dr. Blues' past, we'll just have to start with the information it provided. A bird capable of building Dreamflux Reef must not be an ordinary bird!

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Dream's Edge|update|Sir Whittaker might know something related to this photo. Keep asking him about it.}}

;(Talk to Sir Whittaker)
:'''Sir Whittaker:''' Found the info you wanted?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About this photo...
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' Oh... This photo really brings back memories.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' It once belonged to Origami Dreamweaver Fischer, who was also my mentor. In his later years, he led us Paperfold University students in compiling a family history of the Nightingales. This photo should have been from that time.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Origami Dreamweavers...
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' They were students of the first Dreamweaver, Professor Glaux, and legendary Dreamweavers who created the Twelve Hours. What you witness in each Dreamscape is their legacy.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' ...Alas, it's a shame that this Dreamscape only has their works engraved, but left their names long forgotten.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Dreamchaser era...
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' That was a time when countless dreams sprouted. Mr. Fischer once told me of that age...
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' During that time, Penacony had only just completed the Dreamscape's development. The lineages weren't completely given unto Harmony's embrace yet, and countless opportunities buried in dreams were waiting to be unearthed, resulting in numerous Dreamchasers gathering like moths to a flame, thirsting for fortune and success.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' To build a true Planet of Festivities, Professor Glaux &mdash; who was the Nightingale's family head &mdash; began recruiting the most stellar talents across the cosmos, leading them in the exploration of methods to modify the Dreamscape &mdash; what you know as dreamweaving technology.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' His four most outstanding students were coined the Origami Dreamweavers. They were architects, but first and foremost, they were great Dreamchasers who conquered the Dreamscape.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm about done with my questions.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' This may just be my speculation, but the original inspiration for those leader-birds in the Clockie cartoons &mdash; they were these Origami Dreamweavers.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hang on! The numbers don't add up!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (Origami birds come in five colors... but there are only four legendary Dreamweavers here! Which one is Dr. Blues exactly?)
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' About this... I'm not too sure either. If you're interested, you may wish to seek out the truth yourself.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' Time will cause the colors of past tales to fade, buried by extravagance and embellishment... Young one, I'm very glad that you still remember them.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' I'll lend you this photograph for now. I hope you can unearth the history behind this matter.

:'''Dr. Blues:''' Where'd you get this photograph from? I already told you I'm very busy, I...

:'''Dr. Blues:''' This is my photo? No... It seems different...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not in it?
::'''Dr. Blues:''' This isn't my photo, but I recognize, no, I'm very familiar with these few...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You know these Dreamweavers?
::'''Dr. Blues:''' I should know them, or rather, I'm very familiar...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've even found some information from the past.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ''The Dreamweaver Archives''...
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ...What's all this nonsense about! The true Nightingales weren't like this at all, we...
:'''Dr. Blues:''' W&mdash;We...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What were you like?
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ...I don't remember.
:'''Dr. Blues:''' Oh no, I've been a bird for so long. It's as if I've forgotten something important...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, then, you should let me help you!
:'''Dr. Blues:''' ...
:'''Dr. Blues:''' No. I've seen what Clockie does... Letting someone into your brain? That's disgusting. No.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Esteemed head?
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' Please dispense with the formalities. Authority and power blind the soul. When it's after work hours, I much prefer people address me as Sir Whittaker.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} I wish to learn how to weave dreams too.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' Of course you may. The Family has established the Paperfold University in the Moment of Sol. When classes start, I'll be sure to welcome you to sit in on our dreamweaving course.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can birds be Dreamweavers?
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' Birds... Heh-heh, you mean the cartoons that the Watchmaker created.
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' It's not a bad metaphor at all. The Dreamweavers in this Dreamscape are really all birds. Our Nightingale symbol &mdash; is it not a bird that sings at night?
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' In this Dreamscape, birds are a symbol of Dreamweavers. This sentiment has been expressed in objects of all sorts, and shown up in some pieces of artistry.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Such as origami birds?
::'''Sir Whittaker:''' That's right. Art and reality always complement each other. According to what I know, the origami birds in ''Clockie&ast;''s cartoons symbolize the Dreamweavers that gave their all to build the Dreamscapes.
