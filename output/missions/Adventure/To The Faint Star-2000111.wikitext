===Find the repeater in the storage zone{{subst:void|<!--200011002-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Storage Zone|The station has been sending and receiving cosmic signals through an airwave repeater located in the lost territory guarded by monsters. It's been recently known as the signature cabin of the Disposal Site. With communications cut off, the most important task is naturally to ensure that the repeater is functional.}}

The two lovers are now separated into two different space-time coordinates.<br />To him, she has become a ghost that wanders in the future. And to her, he has long grown old and perished. He may have to wait an entire lifetime for them to speak to one another just once.<br />In the end, it is your choice whether to tell him the truth or not.}}
