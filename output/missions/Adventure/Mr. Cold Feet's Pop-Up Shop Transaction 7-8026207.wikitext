{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sampo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620103--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620201-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620203--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620301-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Business people like us are all about buying things from one place and selling them to other places. You might think that this meme isn't working out in Belobog, but someone might actually love it on some other planet.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620303--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620401-->)
::'''Sampo:''' I jest, but the Knights of Beauty are most deserving of my utmost admiration. There are only two types of people as steadfast as them: Idiots and fools.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620403--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620501-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Honestly though, these stress relief toys are really getting popular these days. Then again, the world's full of turmoil that makes it hard to laugh.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620503--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620601-->)
::'''Sampo:''' What are some tips there for self-deprecation, you ask? I'm not a comedic actor, I wouldn't know. But I have seen some who disregard the comedy of their routines and only doing their utmost to let others hear their own laughter...
::'''Sampo:''' Heavens, that's so scary. Please don't become someone like that.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' Fam, it's the last day for this shop's old games. Use {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Quantum Ripples}}, and add a few {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Seeds}}, and we'll be unlocking the secrets of the universe... Just kidding. Shall we begin?

:'''Sampo:''' All done. Finally managed to {{Rubi|monetize|sell out}} this meme crate. How about it? Fun and money-making, pretty worth it, eh?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're a good friend.
::'''Sampo:''' Hahaha! I knew you'd be pleased.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm still going to report you for selling fake goods...
::'''Sampo:''' Why would you do that? I refunded all the customers who left poor reviews.
:'''Sampo:''' Though, I gather you must be at least a little curious &mdash; why would I choose to get into the meme business at this time?
:'''Sampo:''' I have nothing to hide anyway. I met a few friends recently for a few drinks. Remember that tavern we talked about? It's all the same everywhere &mdash; there's never a lack of booze at bar tops, only stories.
:'''Sampo:''' Which is why, you made money this trip, and I got to have my fun. To be able to sell memes that self-create stories across the galaxy &mdash; I won't be lacking in funny tales tonight.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a pragmatic answer.
::'''Sampo:''' Haha, we've known each other a long time. This is the accumulated wisdom of many years of being a traveling merchant.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds very much like something you'd do.
::'''Sampo:''' Haha, thank you for the compliment. This is the accumulated wisdom of many years of being a traveling merchant.
:'''Sampo:''' Which means to say, that crate of aged-eight-year meme was also gifted by a friend of mine. Thinking back, I've also had run-ins as adventurous as the Nameless have had.
:'''Sampo:''' Haha, a true man doesn't wax lyrical on his hot-blooded past. It's pointless to talk about my past adventures. I'll see you again, (Trailblazer)! Although there are many things you can't drink...
:'''Sampo:''' But I intend to go have a drink!
;(Screen fades to black)
:Humming a strange tune, Sampo's silhouette slowly fades away in the distance.
:'''Sampo:''' Well the {{Rubi|magic mill|Sampo}} grinds when finished, to and fro the lid in rocking, grinds one measure at the day-break, grinds a measure fit for eating, grinds a second for the market, grinds a third one for the store-house! Ho! ♪
