{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|With starskiff navigation, an error of mere millidegrees can result in misnavigation by lightyears. Thanks to Sushang's guidance and protection, Luocha and you arrived at the plagued Artisanship Commission due to the rebirth of Ambrosial Arbor and saved the young judge, Xueyi.<br />Xueyi requested you to escort her away from the place. Talk to your friends and see what they plan to do.}}

:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 147.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' So this is the Luofu's Ambrosial Arbor? It's my first time seeing it.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 danheng 107.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Aren't you a Cloud Knight?
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 148.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Clouds Knights don't visit the Ambrosial Arbor without a reason, plus I'm new here...
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 149.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' The Luofu's plaguemark is a tree, while the Yaoqing's is a moon. Ha, I think we got the better one.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 139.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' ...I heard that the Ambrosial Arbor shriveled and died a long time ago... How could it suddenly spring back to life and start growing again?
----
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 xueyi 101.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' The influence of the Stellaron... There's no time for explanations &mdash; we must return to the Ten-Lords Commission! I'm wounded &mdash; I need your assistance in getting there. Once we get to Starskiff Jetty, you can go your separate ways.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 140.ogg}} '''Luocha and Dan Heng:''' ...
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 150.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' ...Well, there's nothing else for it, we're duty-bound to help the Ten-Lords Commission...

;(Talk to Luocha)
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 141.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' Hehe, I did not expect such a short journey to be filled with so many twists and turns.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 142.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' How does it feel, Master Dan Heng, to be a subject of the Ten-Lords Commission?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's a pleasure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's a pain.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 143.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' A good answer, short and to the point. It would seem I've been unsuccessful in de-tangling myself of matters thus far...
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 luocha 144.ogg}} '''Luocha:''' I suggest we hasten to Starskiff Jetty and send this Judge of the Ten-Lords Commission on her way &mdash; we must continue our own journeys as soon as possible.

;(Talk to Sushang)
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 176.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Uh, sorry... All Cloud Knights answer to the Ten-Lords Commission. Duty calls...
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 177.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Apologies for asking you to stick with me a bit longer. I'll treat you guys when I get you back to safety.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not a Cloud Knight.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's go our separate ways now.
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 178.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Um... I guess you could slip away and find a safe spot to hide. I'll come back and get you once I've sent her on her way.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No need. I operate alone.
::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 179.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Not a smart way to operate. The Luofu is more dangerous than ever &mdash; I can't let you put yourself in harm's way.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hmm, in that case...
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 sushang 180.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Come onnnn‚Åì Together is better!

;(Talk to Xueyi)
:{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 xueyi 102.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' You look familiar.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you're mistaken.
::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 xueyi 103.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Hmm... Maybe.
::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 xueyi 104.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' I ran your facial profile against the records in The Shackling Prison just now. Indeed, there were no matches to be found.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
::{{A|VO chapter2 Ag1 xueyi 105.ogg}} '''Xueyi:''' Don't be nervous. I ran your facial profile against the records in The Shackling Prison just now. Indeed, there were no matches to be found.
