::'''Dahao:''' I always feel like we're missing something here at the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery, but I can never remember what. You've come at just the right time &mdash; help me rule out some possibilities. Say, tell me, what do you think our office is missing?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Promo materials showcasing the work of the Realm-Keeping Commission.
:::'''Dahao:''' Not that...
:::'''Dahao:''' I raised this with Jingyan before, whether we should be better at promoting how good the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery is at what it does. But she gave me a list of all the things we've done recently, and there isn't really anything to be proud of.
:::'''Dahao:''' Once we crack a major case that even the Ten-Lords Commission can't solve, then I'll let the whole Exalting Sanctum know about how great the Realm-Keeping Commission is... Until then, we'll keep things on the down-low.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Small ornaments that make this place feel alive.
:::'''Dahao:''' Make the place feel alive... Actually, I've thought about that.
:::'''Dahao:''' I'm a big fan of alcoholic nectar and once stashed two bottles of Nectar of Willow Woods at the Chancery, but Officer Jingyan threw them out. She said this is the workplace and it would be undignified if anyone found out.
:::'''Dahao:''' I also like pretty foxian actresses, so I've put up a couple of their pictures on my desk to perk up my spirits. But Officer Jingyan confiscated those too. She said this is the workplace and those images are indecent.
:::'''Dahao:''' *sigh* The only way the Realm-Keeping Commission feels alive is through all the courier parcels on the ground.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} A Realm-Keeping Commission Officer who is actually productive at work.
:::'''Dahao:''' {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young man}}, that remark is uncalled for. At least Officer Jingyan is doing her work. As long as Officer Jingyan is here, then the Realm-Keeping Commission lives up to its name.
:::'''Dahao:''' That Songyan kid may be lazy, but he's smart. I have high hopes for his future.
:::'''Dahao:''' Naturally, if anything actually happens to Exalting Sanctum, you'll find me to be an extremely reliable officer.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is now really the time to be thinking about that?
:::'''Dahao:''' Yeah, I can't figure it out even if I rack my brain. I think I'll play a few rounds of Celestial Jade after work and think it through then.
:::'''Dahao:''' Alright, let's get down to business. {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young man}}, what do you want?

::'''Jingyan:''' One second.
::'''Jingyan:''' Alright. I'm Jingyan from the Realm-Keeping Commission, and I'm in charge of general affairs here. Is there anything that I can help you with?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What can you help me with?
:::'''Jingyan:''' ...I was just asking you that, but you asked me the same thing. Okay.
:::'''Jingyan:''' Household registrations, applications, and maintenance for local Xianzhou citizens. Handling of cases such as fighting, wounding with a weapon, theft, robbery. Processing census data, demographic statistics, resource allocation...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I get it. Please stop this monotonous chanting.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Looks like you aren't really that interested in the work of Realm-Keeping Commission officers.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, you've all done a great job.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Ah, so you're here to inspect our work then? Thank you for taking the time to visit our humble Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery.
::::'''Jingyan:''' But I'm afraid it's currently during business hours, so please do not interrupt our everyday consultations.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've been cyber-scammed!
:::'''Jingyan:''' Cyber-scammed? We don't differentiate between scams happening online or offline here.
:::'''Jingyan:''' Please register your contact details, how the scammer contacted you, how you were scammed, and how much you were scammed out of? Go fill this out, and I'll verify your account for you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, I wasn't scammed at all.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Hmm. It's still currently during business hours, so please do not cause any trouble for our busy officers.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Based on my experience, you don't really look like a victim of scamming.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Th&mdash;There's no transaction record on the account.
::::'''Jingyan:''' This is a bit of a hassle. Not even the Realm-Keeping Commission can get back your "money that wasn't scammed."
::::'''Jingyan:''' Seems like you'll have to sort that part out on your own. Our hands are tied here at the Realm-Keeping Commission.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think I have anything that's connected to general affairs.
::'''Jingyan:''' Excuse me, do you have anything else?

::'''Songyan:''' Ah~ If the Realm-Keeping Commission could give me the cash directly and let me stay at home all day without doing this troublesome job, that'd be great.
::'''Songyan:''' Anyway, it doesn't matter what I do or not do, the results are always gonna be the same. Why not cut out this middle part...
::'''Songyan:''' Hm? Eavesdropping is rude, {{MC|f=lady|m=sir}}, you know. What's up? If it's something important, please go to Official Dahao, and for literally anything else, please approach Officer Jingyan.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So... You just don't deal with anything?
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the Realm-Keeping Commission's Most Intelligent, and I only show up when those two get stuck. In other words, I'm the Ultimate Trump Card. Do you lead with your ace when you're playing tiles?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's only three officers staffing this tiny Chancery...
::::'''Songyan:''' What about it? There can be a trump card hidden among three people.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're just spouting nonsense, aren't you?
::::'''Songyan:''' There's a saying. "Of three people, one will be a slacker." If I call dibs on slacking off, then the other two can't.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What issues would you be handling normally?
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the kind of person who hates inconvenience. If you have any kind of work that's not too tiring, not too troublesome &mdash; then I'm down for that.
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the Realm-Keeping Commission's Most Intelligent, and I only show up when those two get stuck. Just look at those two, and I'm mainly talking about the Officer Jingyan here &mdash; still going at it so hard, so I don't have to.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I just so happen to have a really thorny problem that I could use your help with...
::::'''Songyan:''' No no no, any thorny problem should be handed over to Jingyan. She's the main backbone of the Realm-Keeping Commission.
::::'''Songyan:''' Have you heard of this saying before? "With little power comes little responsibility." The little refers to me.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm going to tell Officer Jingyan right now.
::::'''Songyan:''' Doesn't matter, mate. A person like her is born to work hard, and she never trusts what I do. Also, every time when there are "outstanding troubles" to deal with, she'll just complete it for me, personally.
::::'''Songyan:''' So telling her anything would just be adding to her troubles. I urge you not to do this.
::'''Songyan:''' *sigh* {{MC|f=Miss|m=My man}}, put aside your judgmental look. I've put in the hours working long and hard before, and I was, once upon a time, considered an elite officer of the General Affairs.
::'''Songyan:''' Besides, why do I work at the Realm-Keeping Commission? If it weren't for my failed investments... With all the curves on the chart going down, and only the prices are going up. Working has become a necessary option.
::'''Songyan:''' I hustled, and I failed. Now, this is the best effort I can put into work right now.
::'''Songyan:''' Hey, don't leave just yet. As long as we're chatting here, there won't be any new tasks assigned to me. Let's chat a little longer, {{MC|f=miss|m=sir}}.

;(Talk to Qingzu)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 101 f.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' (Trailblazer), I read the letter you obtained from the mara-struck.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 102.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' While the Cloud Knights were searching for the Stellaron's whereabouts, I was carrying out the general's orders &mdash; tracking down clues on the mara-struck. Thanks to your efforts, we now have a lead.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 103.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' To an outsider, this letter appears to be nothing more than good news detailing a recovery from a chronic illness. However, what is actually being discussed is a violation of the Ten Unpardonable Sins. It's heresy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you talking about Merciful Medicus?
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 104.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Correct. The term "Merciful Medicus" is one of respect &mdash; one that any law-abiding citizen of the Alliance would never dare utter.
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 105.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' It refers to none other than the enemy of the people of the Xianzhou &mdash; the one we now call the Plagues Author... The Aeon of Abundance &mdash; Yaoshi.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you talking about the pharmacological experiment mentioned in the letter?
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 106.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' That's right. Since the Alliance was first established, all medical practices aboard the Xianzhou adhere to strict standards that prohibit long-life or mutant modifications under the guise of "curing."
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 107.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I went through all our files to find information on the experiment in question, and found nothing. I started thinking about how the Alchemy Commission's delve was sealed off... There must be an unspeakable secret locked away there.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 108.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' The author of this letter was likely the mara-struck you defeated. My guess is he was led astray and poisoned while under the pretext of being cured. You saw how he ended up...
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 109.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Such actions remind me of an organization that was eradicated from the Xianzhou a thousand years ago... the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 110.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' They were disciples of the Abundance that sought to restore the way of immortality by unearthing a forbidden remedial formula.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 111.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' It's hard to believe a group that was wiped out so long ago would suddenly rear its head and create chaos once more. The Seat of Divine Foresight needs to learn all it can about this organization's status before the situation reaches a point of no return.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 113.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' If you come across any similar clues about the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, come and find me at the Seat of Divine Foresight &mdash; these kinds of firsthand accounts are exactly what we require.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, what do I get out of it?
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 114.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Don't worry, the Seat of Divine Foresight always rewards those who contribute to our efforts.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds good to me.
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 115.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Excellent. Your work will not be in vain. The Seat of Divine Foresight always rewards those who contribute to our efforts.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like one big headache to me...
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 116.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I understand, but all I'm asking is for you to keep an eye out when you have time. The Seat of Divine Foresight always rewards those who contribute to our efforts.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 117.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I recently received some intel. It seems that certain individuals are taking advantage of the current chaos to lure in outworlders around Exalting Sanctum. Maybe you could start there?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 118.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' We sent an undercover investigator out a few months ago &mdash; they provided us with a rough idea of the situation.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 119.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Unfortunately, it seems suspicions were aroused... We lost contact with the agent &mdash; I suspect he was discovered...
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 120.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' You are a fresh face on the Luofu and an outworlder. I would feel more at ease if I could leave this matter with you.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 122.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Danger is practically an inevitability, take care and try to stay out of harm's way.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, can I join the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus now?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 146.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Calm yourself... The initiation is divided into two steps &mdash; you and the Cloud Knight have completed the first. Now... only the second remains.

::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 148.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' The Disciples' initiation is governed by the following principle &mdash; never accept who you suspect, and never suspect who you accept. So...
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 149.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' ...it's time for you two to battle it out. Whoever survives will officially become a disciple.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why?
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 150.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Transcribing scripture allows us to ascertain your devotion, but determining whether or not you'll be loyal to the organization requires a stronger guarantee... Sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, I didn't write the rules.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll pass...
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 151.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' There is nothing that can be done. I didn't write the rules. If you are unwilling to complete the initiation process, then we will have to ask that you keep our secrets hidden... permanently...

::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 153.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' We aren't forcing you to fight &mdash; by all means refuse if you wish... but we won't possibly be able to let either of you leave.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 124.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' I... Fine, fine &mdash; but at least let me prepare. I've never done anything like this before...

:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 127.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is a devout group, holding firm in their belief that Merciful Medicus is the one, ultimate faith. As followers, we refer to ourselves as disciples, dedicated to our cause.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 128.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' If you wish to gain the means to immortality, then you must become a disciple... but to become a disciple, you must first pass several small trials.

::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 133.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Foxians yearn to cure themselves of their 300-year lifespan. The Vidyadhara yearn to cure themselves of the pain of reincarnation and lack of progeny...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of trial do I have to pass?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 136.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' "What you seek, you will surely find." Merciful Medicus is magnanimous &mdash; they do not lightly refuse a prayer. As such, the initiation trials for the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus are nothing arduous.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 137.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' All you must do is transcribe this copy of "Thousand-Handed Merciful Medicus' Salvation" 500 times by hand. This will allow your brothers and sisters to trust your faith... and you to become a disciple.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 138.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' This scripture is central to the Disciples &mdash; you must maintain a pious heart during the transcription... It would be best if you could memorize the text.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 139.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Of course, this is but the first trial. Once you have become a disciple, you will undergo numerous others.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} 500 times seems excessive...
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 140.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Excessive? The old rules dictated that the text be copied 50,000 times &mdash; I myself undertook such a feat. Nowadays, the master takes greater pity on the common people, hence the number has been reduced to a mere 500.

:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 125.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Listen... I have an idea that will let you join the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus, and let me get the heck out of here in one piece.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 126.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' You and I fight, and I lose to you &mdash; I pretend that you finished me off. Then, you pretend to help them remove my body by dragging me out of here...
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 127.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' That way we both accomplish our objectives.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 128.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Oh, uh... I've seen your skills... Please don't mess up and actually kill me...
:I know what I'm doing.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 129.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Good. I know I could trust you... My life is in your hands!
:I can't make any guarantees...
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 130.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Just... Ugh, whatever, I got myself into this &mdash; let fate decide. Just try and hold back a little, okay!?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 156.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' So, have you prepared yourselves? Are you ready to fight?
:Let's do it.
:Not yet.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 157.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' And you, Cloud Knight?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 131.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' I... I'm ready...
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 158.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Then let's begin.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 132.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Well... then... take this!
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 159.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' What magnificent skill! He was fierce, but no match for you.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 160.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' I'm glad you prevailed &mdash; that Cloud Knight waltzed straight up to us in uniform and asked if he could join &mdash; hardly a convincing spectacle. I doubt I ever could've trusted him.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 161.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Purple Chrysanthemum, Blue Peach, find somewhere to dispose of the body.
:Let me handle it.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 162.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Oh, you've dealt with this kind of thing before?
:I have a long-term associate that handles problems like this.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 163.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' A long-time associate, eh? You're well-connected, I see...
:It's a side hustle.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 164.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Side... hustle? Ahem, very well &mdash; these are hard times, I suppose.
:Do you doubt me?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 165.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Not at all! As I said earlier &mdash; disciples never suspect who we accept.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 166.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Hmm... this does have its advantages. Our brothers and sisters have been proselytizing in Exalting Sanctum over the last few days &mdash; we may have attracted the attention of the devils... Having you dispose of the Cloud Knight will be safer.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 167.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' As such, this can be your first mission as a disciple. You take an active approach to getting things done &mdash; I'll be sure to pass that on to my superiors.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 168.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' In any case... my hearty congratulations on your admission to the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. From now on, you will be known by the code name... Gray Peony!
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 169.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Well, Gray Peony, let's depart separately to avoid attracting attention &mdash; we'll rendezvous at a different location later. Until then.
:You take the Cloud Knight to a safe place.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 133.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Whew. I did a good job playing dead, didn't I?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 134.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Those people are out of their minds &mdash; watch your step next time you're around them...
:How... How are you still alive?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 135.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Wait, y&mdash;you weren't holding back?
:He stares at your face for a long time before he realizes that you're joking.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 136.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' Gah, enough with the jokes already &mdash; it's a miracle either of us is alive.
:I'll be careful.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 137.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' With your skills, you've got a better chance than most.
:They can't take me in a fight.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 138.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' With your skills, you've got a better chance than most.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 cknightZ 139.ogg}} '''Strange Cloud Knight:''' I should report back to the Seat of Divine Foresight. Stay safe, friend!
:The Cloud Knight vigilantly monitors his surroundings. After he's certain no one is tracking them, he makes a swift getaway.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 101 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Green Hibiscus agreed to meet me here, but there's no sight of him. What gives?)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 102 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (There's a letter here... What's this on the envelope? "Gray Peony..." This must be from Green Hibiscus.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 103 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 103 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (The Disciples sure know how to keep a low profile... Looks like I'll need to help them complete this mission.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 104 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 104 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (If they're looking to intercept a letter, then I should probably search around the Exalting Sanctum's Cycrane Stand.)
:You rummage through the packages on this Cycrane Stand, but you don't find the letter you are looking for.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 105 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (It doesn't seem to be on this Cycrane Stand. Let's check out another one.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 106 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (What's written on this package? "Seat of Divine Foresight, Urgent..." This is it &mdash; the mail the Disciples want to intercept.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 107 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 107 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Hmm, seems like it's encrypted somehow... Makes sense, this is critical intelligence after all... Let's see if I can crack the code.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 108 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 108 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Code cracked... Huh, it's an internal order from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 109 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 109 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Judging from these "Urgent Instructions," the Disciples are aware of a Seat of Divine Foresight operation to infiltrate their ranks... No wonder Green Hibiscus was so eager to intercept this.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 110 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 110 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (I'll use my phone to make a copy and then hand it over to Green Hibiscus.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 101 f.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' Is that the general's honored guest? I didn't expect to see you around Exalting Sanctum.
:What brings you here?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 103.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' The person in charge of the courier cycranes here is a Vidyadhara &mdash; just like me. Her day has arrived &mdash; she's already headed to Scalegorge Waterscape to self-reincarnate.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 104.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' I'll be handling her duties until her replacement arrives.
:What do you mean by "her day"?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 105.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' As a Vidyadhara, one's lifespan typically spans six or seven hundred years. At the end of that span, there comes a day when we journey to Scalegorge Waterscape and embark on a new phase through self-reincarnation. It marks a significant moment in our eternal life cycle.
:Sorry for your loss...
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 106.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' Haha, don't be. The lifespan of a Vidyadhara typically spans six or seven hundred years. At the end of that span, there comes a day when we journey to Scalegorge Waterscape and embark on a new phase through self-reincarnation. It marks a significant moment in our eternal life cycle.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 107.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' So, what can I help you with?
:I'm looking for a package...
:Nothing, I'm fine.
:You hide the sensitive message and give Ziqiao a quick rundown on your mission.
:Ziqiao listens to your explanation. After making a few calls and confirming the situation, she helps you find a parcel that has "For the Seat of Divine Foresight. Urgent," written on it.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 108.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' When it comes to classified matters concerning the Seat of Divine Foresight, it's best I keep my questions to myself. Here's the package.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ziqiao 109.ogg}} '''Ziqiao:''' Well, I'll let you get back to your business &mdash; I've got things I need to do attend to. See you, and take care.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 111 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 111 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (It's an internal order from the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 112 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 112 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (Judging from these "Urgent Instructions," the Disciples are aware of a Seat of Divine Foresight operation to infiltrate their ranks... No wonder Green Hibiscus was so eager to intercept this.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 113 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 player 113 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' (I'll use my phone to make a copy and then hand it over to Green Hibiscus.)
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 170.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Gray Peony, did you intercept the secret letter?
:I've intercepted it.
:Did we find the spy?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 171.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' You read the contents? Ugh... this job is proving to be somewhat difficult. Those devils at the Seat of Divine Foresight are too cunning.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 172.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Good work. Unfortunately, the traitor has already found refuge under their wing... It appears that even our interception couldn't prevent the intel on our mission from slipping through the cracks.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 173.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' *sigh* Your work here is done &mdash; we'll take it from here... Of course, as a fellow disciple, there will come a time when you too will be tasked with resolving such issues &mdash; one among many duties of the Disciples.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 174.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' You have already proven yourself to be a competent disciple. The head of our operations in Exalting Sanctum is coming to pay you a visit.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 175.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Just a moment. He will be here shortly.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 176.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Mauve Moon, this is the reliable disciple I mentioned to you &mdash; Gray Peony.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 177.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' Gray Peony, this is Mauve Moon &mdash; the head of our operations in Exalting Sanctum.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 101.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' It seems you have some impressive skills in your arsenal.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're too kind.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 102.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' No need for modesty. I've studied martial arts for years &mdash; I can tell how strong you are with just a glance.
::How much can you bench?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 103.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Haha, I like this kid.
::You look kind of weak.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much can you bench?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 103.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Haha, I like this kid.
::You look kind of weak.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look kind of weak.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcF 178.ogg}} '''Green Hibiscus:''' ...How dare you!
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 104.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Easy, Hibiscus... I like this kid.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 105.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' You seem like you've got it all figured out... What brings you to the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I despise The Hunt.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 106.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' I can appreciate that. The Devilish Archer Author's so-called salvation is no different from destruction.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 107.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' THEY used deceit and power to mislead the people of the Xianzhou, instilling fear in THEM about the blessings of Merciful Medicus.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 108.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' The mission of the Disciples is to strike down this groundless fear, so that the people of the Xianzhou can return to the warm embrace of Merciful Medicus.
::I want to become even stronger.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 109.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Good, so do I. I used to think determination and hard work were enough to achieve that... But I've come to realize it's not that simple.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 110.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' During my many years as a Cloud Knight, I realized something... An individual's strength is limited.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 111.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' So, I abandoned my mortal body and became a faithful servant of Merciful Medicus.
::I want to gain immortality.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 112.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Good. Life is a miracle and a blessing. Any futile attempt to forsake it is a disgraceful betrayal.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 113.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' You have been enlightened to the significance of immortality. You have already surpassed those shameful mortals.
::I'm not sure...

::I'm not sure...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm not sure...
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 114.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Don't worry about it. The pursuit of power and immortality is ingrained in the fabric of human nature.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 115.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Any act that runs counter to that instinct is lamentable, shameful, and futile... You may not have found the path yet, but you've already chosen the right direction. Very good.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 ywmcG 116.ogg}} '''Mauve Moon:''' Here, take this prescription. Through this medicine, you will become like me. You will be able to break the shackles that the Devilish Archer Author has used to chain your soul. You will gain unbridled power and freedom.

::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 125.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' Don't worry, your operation was a success &mdash; although your identity was ultimately exposed, you gained a wealth of invaluable intelligence. On top of that, you managed to get out without a scratch.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 126.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' *sigh* ...I never imagined that Zhixin would choose the path of evil.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 128 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 ywmc1 qingzu 128 f.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' (Trailblazer), you did the right thing.
