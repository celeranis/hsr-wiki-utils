:'''Herta:''' Oh! You got the hang of it immediately! This time, we specially made a space for you to have an audience with the Aeons. Let's do a test first.

:'''Herta:''' Seems like there's nothing else I need to teach you. I've activated the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Audience Chamber}}, a module that can help you have an audience with the Aeons quicker.
:'''Herta:''' You can follow the footsteps of the Pathstriders to get closer to a particular Aeon.
:'''Herta:''' No doubt, that's another of Stephen's ideas. He always underestimates the trickiness of an issue. Ah well, I guess as long as his ideas work.

;(Talk to Herta)
