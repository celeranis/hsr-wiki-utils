;(Talk to Cloud Knights Soldier)

:Standing by the door, you see a Cloud Knight neither guarding it nor seeming to want to go inside. Just when he seems lost in his dilemma, he catches sight of you, and an attitude of seeing his savior pours forth through the gaps in his helmet.
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mister}}, please wait! I know you possess considerable talent. Please help me!
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' There is a dangerous criminal that has taken a seven-hundred-year old... old man hostage. Strange, would anyone on the Xianzhou really stress that a seven-hundred-year old was an old man...?
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I need you to help me guard this door. The criminal is not aware of us yet. I need to go and get reinforcements.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who needs reinforcement? One baseball bat is enough for me!
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Although I have heard tell of your great strength, as a Cloud Knight, I cannot take risks when it comes to the safety of a hostage. That is especially true when the hostage is an elderly man.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you overestimate me! How am I supposed to stop them?
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Rest assured, the kidnapper won't come rushing out of this door as long as we don't go alert them. Plus, their hostage is an old man with limited mobility.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can you not just... uhh... make a phone call?
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Though I'm ashamed to admit it, the signal in this place is no good... When this is all over, I will go and file a complaint against that no-good contractor.
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Anyway, please stay here and keep a close eye on this door. If the kidnapper tries to break the door down or make a move, please try to buy us some time. I'll be right back!
:Hmm... Wait a second! How do you know that this Cloud Knight isn't just messing you around? Maybe try listening in and seeing what's going on.
:'''Bandit:''' You had a lot more to say for yourself before, old man. Why so quiet now?
:'''Elder:''' Humph, don't be so smug, youngster. I may have been careless and let you capture me, but I have seven grandsons, each of them with their own unique skills. If I go missing for a while, they're sure to come looking!
:'''Elder:''' Plus, I can sense that there is a powerful someone behind that door right now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You noticed me.
::'''Elder:''' Well, I am no normal old man, hehe.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? There's someone strong here?
::'''Elder:''' A little more confidence, please, master!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If that's the case, I'm coming in!
::'''Elder:''' Master, please stay calm.
:'''Elder:''' There is no need for you to get involved in this. My grandsons are all seed competitors that came to take part in the Wardance. Please give these youngsters a chance to prove themselves.
:'''Bandit:''' Enough nonsense! Y&mdash;You're just blowing hot air!


;(Talk to Fighter in Red)
:'''Fighter in Red:''' Humph, I did not expect you to send me into the contest... Foolish kidnapper, you're in for it now! I can lift a starskiff with a single hand and make myself bigger or smaller as I please. I'll crush you like an ant, kidnapper!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There we go. That's the spirit!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to go with you?
::'''Fighter in Red:''' There is no need. I can handle this alone.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you not take a brother with you?
::'''Fighter in Red:''' There is no need. I can handle this alone.
:'''Fighter in Red:''' Enough rambling!
:'''Elder:''' I'll give it to you, leech. You have some party tricks.
:'''Bandit:''' Hey, that has nothing to do with me! He suddenly enlarged himself and knocked his own head. How can you blame me for that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like we're off to a head-start.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So he's more of a headbanger?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I saw that coming...
:'''Elder:''' No need to fear! I have raised these grandsons for years for this very moment. Gray-haired master, send in my next grandson!

;(Talk to Fighter in Orange)
:'''Fighter in Orange:''' Humph, I have never been a fan of violence. Defeating a kidnapper is all about using your wits. Give me one look at this villain and I shall know his weaknesses, his movements, and his trends.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} None of those sounds like attack.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to go with you?
::'''Fighter in Orange:''' No technique can escape my discerning eyes. Do not underestimate me!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you not take a brother with you?
::'''Fighter in Orange:''' No technique can escape my discerning eyes. Do not underestimate me!
:'''Fighter in Orange:''' Believe me, I shall have victory!
;(Screen fades to black)
:'''Fighter in Orange:''' Give up now, pathetic kidnapper! I can see through any technique you may have! My eyes see in all directions and expose all stealth techniques. My ears hear all sound waves, no matter the distance!
:'''Bandit:''' What are you talking about...
:'''Fighter in Orange:''' No flashy technique can deceive my eyes and ears. Though you can lie with your words, your muscles and heart rate tell the truth.
:'''Fighter in Orange:''' Just like how your lower body has moved slightly, and your fist is clenching tight. I am certain that you are planning to approach me while I talk and punch me in the nose... Oof!
:Judging from the sound, that was a one-hit KO...
:'''Bandit:''' Ahh... look at that, you were right...
:'''Elder:''' Grandson!!!
:'''Bandit:''' Sorry, I could not help myself.
:'''Elder:''' Humph, don't get so cocky! Gray-haired master! Send in my next grandson!

;(Talk to Fighter in Yellow)
:'''Fighter in Yellow:''' Grandpa, don't worry, I will save you! A true master will make all of their enemy's attacks completely useless!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That actually sounds like it makes sense...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You want me to go with you?
::'''Fighter in Yellow:''' How can I allow this? That is my grandfather! I must save him myself!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will you not take a brother with you?
::'''Fighter in Yellow:''' I am his favorite grandson! You all stay back, and I will save him myself!
:'''Fighter in Yellow:''' Before I learned to walk, I learned to channel my inner energy! No attack can harm me, and I have never in my life known the meaning of a wound. Wait for me, grandfather! I'm coming to save you!
;(Screen fades to black)
:'''Fighter in Yellow:''' Let me teach you one thing, kidnapper. Only a body that perseveres can be undefeated.
:'''Bandit:''' He... he's glowing...! That amber glow... could it be!?
:'''Elder:''' That's right. This grandson of mine practices the technique of Skymending. As soon as it is activated, he is like the Firmamend Arbiter among mortals. No man can harm him!
:'''Bandit:''' S&mdash;s&mdash;so... how are you going to overpower me? Hah, don't be so arrogant! I'm not scared of some little supernatural magic tricks!
:'''Fighter in Yellow:''' Overpower you? No. I have mastered Skymending, but it cannot be used for offense, only defense. As long as I do not disrupt my technique, no one can harm me.
:'''Bandit:''' ...So, you can't harm me either?
:'''Fighter in Yellow:''' Indeed.
:'''Bandit:''' ...
:'''Bandit:''' Then why should I even bother with you? Go stand in the corner.
:'''Bandit:''' Old man, call in your next grandson!
:'''Elder:''' ...Next grandson!!! Come and save grandpa!!!

;(Talk to Fighter in Green)
:'''Fighter in Green:''' This kidnapper is tricksy! It looks like we will have to use our sibling bond to deal with him!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
:'''Bandit:''' I hope this one works for you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Show us a hot-blooded combo attack!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you want me to attack with you?
::'''Fighter in Green:''' Sorry, our combination is seamless, and there is no room for a third to interfere.
::'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you take a few more brothers?
::'''Fighter in Green:''' Sorry, our combination is seamless, and there is no room for a third to interfere.
::'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
:'''Fighter in Green:''' Brother Five and I have the perfect combination. One of us controls water and the other conducts lightning. I cannot believe this kidnapper has forced us to join forces. This is truly an honor for him!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't flush your grandpa away...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't shock your grandpa into smithereens...
:'''Fighter in Green:''' No need to fear. We have dedicated great study to the path of The Hunt. We excel at solo contest, and we will not harm the innocent.
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then you might have some problems with Pure Fiction.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Whatever, I'm tired.
:'''Fighter in Green:''' Just sit back and watch our powerful combination as we save our grandpa!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Exactly.
;(Screen fades to black)
:You cannot help but feel concern for the kidnapper behind the door. As you sense the fighting spirit of the two siblings, you feel as if you can sense the rage of pure lightning and roaring waves.
:'''Bandit:''' Why don't we talk this out...
:'''Fighter in Green:''' Silence. You kidnapped our grandfather, and you lost the right to negotiate a long time ago!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' That's right! Brother, let us do a battle cry to evoke our courage...
:'''Fighter in Green:''' For friendship!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' For our bonds!
:'''Fighter in Green:''' For the future!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Stop yelling nonsense and call out an attack!
:'''Fighter in Green:''' Brilliant Spirit!
:'''Fighter in Blue:''' Dragon Flood!
:'''Elder:''' NO, DON'T!!!
:At that moment, lightning strikes and thunder claps. The lights aboard the Skysplitter flickered in unison for a few moments before returning to normal.
:'''Bandit:''' Um... Is there anyone else still out there? They're on the ground, twitching. Do you want to call a doctor or something?
:'''Elder:''' Don't worry. This isn't the first time. They're used to it...
:'''Bandit:''' I never really thought that you had to consider elemental reactions when practicing martial arts...
:'''Elder:''' Ah... Gray-haired master, please send in my next grandson!

;(Talk to Fighter in Purple)
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' It's finally time for us to take the stage!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Us? You and who?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're one person, aren't you?
:'''???:''' Are you looking down on me?
:Suddenly, a slightly displeased voice starts to call out from the void behind the purple-clad warrior.
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' Brother Six, {{MC|f=she|m=he}} isn't looking down on you. {{MC|f=She|m=He}} can't even see you.
:'''"Sixth Brother":''' Ahh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood. I practice techniques to conceal myself, and I forget normal people cannot see me.
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' I may not have any martial arts skills, but I have a sacred vessel &mdash; my amethyst-gold gourd! If I call my enemies name and they respond to me, they will be sucked inside the amethyst gold gourd!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is some high-fantasy stuff...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} When did this take a turn for the mystical?
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' Brother Six, let's go.
:'''"Sixth Brother":''' Alright!
;(Screen fades to black)
:'''"Sixth Brother":''' *Xianzhou profanity*, this is bad... Agh!
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' It's not over yet, Brother Six. Our great moment to shine is just beginning!
;(Screen fades to black)
:'''Bandit:''' There's just one of you? Hurry up then, I'm getting tired.
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' Oh? So confident. Now you'll see some real power! Brother Six, now!
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' ...
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' Brother Six? Where's he gone? Stop hiding! You responded when I called your name just now, so...
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' ...Wait...
:'''Fighter in Purple:''' *Xianzhou profanity*, this is bad... Agh!
:You hear the sound of a punch knocking someone to the ground and have a rough understanding of the unsurprising outcome.
:'''Elder:''' ...How many times have I told you? Don't just leave that damn gourd open all the time!
:'''Bandit:''' ...Don't get so worked up, old man. Anger can be bad for your health at your age.
:'''Elder:''' Forget it... Grandson? Where are you, grandson? I need another grandson! I cannot allow our family to be disgraced like this!

:'''Bandit:''' So... it's all over?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have no grandsons left!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm the only one here.
:'''Elder:''' Then... Then I'm counting on you, gray-haired master! Complete this mission and I shall take you as my adopted grandson!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Old man, take advantage of me like that, and I'll beat you myself!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you just call me uncle?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about a more concrete reward...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay, grandpa! I'm coming to save you!
:'''Elder:''' We can discuss all this later! Come and save me first!
:'''Bandit:''' Great Lord of Sanctus Medicus, I can't handle this mess...
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Thanks for your help! I called reinforcements to come and help save the hostage... Hm? What's going on?
:'''Bandit:''' I surrender! I surrender!
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I should have expected no less from you, (Trailblazer)! To pull off a textbook hostage rescue in such a short amount of time is truly amazing!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have no idea. We suffered heavy losses.
::'''Elder:''' ...It's a TPK!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have reformed the kidnapper.
::'''Bandit:''' ...Please, let me go.
:'''Bandit:''' Sir! Please, take me away! I surrender, I confess! This old man sent an army of crazy people to come and torture me one after another!
:'''Elder:''' No, it was my teaching that failed me... I will return and give them a whole new education. I will teach them to fight as one. When that time comes, I will find you and test out their strength!
:'''Bandit:''' No, please! Old man, I was wrong. Please let me go... Take your band of clowns home and keep an eye on them. Don't let them torture anyone ever again. I'm begging you!
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Uhh... Well, as the criminal has been brought to justice, you can leave the rest to us.
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' It is thanks to your help, (Trailblazer), that we were able to rescue the hostage without him coming to harm. I am forever grateful!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It honestly has nothing to do with me! I didn't do anything!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If I'm honest, I sympathize with the kidnapper.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} One simple kidnapper is no trouble for me.
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Haha, be that as it may, please accept this reward as a token of our gratitude. I'll be taking the criminal and witnesses back with me. May we meet again.
