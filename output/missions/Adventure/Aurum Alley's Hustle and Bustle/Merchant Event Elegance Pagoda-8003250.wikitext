;(Talk to Boyang)
:'''Boyang:''' You are (Trailblazer), right? It just so happens that I have something...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait, have we ever met before?
::'''Boyang:''' Yeah, we've met a few times at Miss Secretary's office, but perhaps you don't remember me anymore...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, it's you. How can I help?
::'''Boyang:''' To be honest, I was hoping you could do me a small favor. Don't worry. I'll make it worth your while.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hold it. I'm busy.
::'''Boyang:''' Well, I won't take up much of your time. Maybe you'd like to reconsider?
:'''Boyang:''' Here's the thing: My store sells fandangles, but lately, more and more Outworlders have been flooding in, claiming they've bought precious antiques at low prices.
:'''Boyang:''' Over time, people have started to see my store as an antique shop, and even the merchant guild has been recommending that I officially make the switch. To be honest, selling antiques is more lucrative than selling fandangles, and it would give me more time to relax.
:'''Boyang:''' The thing is, if I were to make the switch, it would be like opening a whole new shop, and I'd have to start from scratch and build up a new customer base. I've been thinking about it, but I haven't quite figured out how to do it yet.
:'''Boyang:''' In the end, Miss Secretary came up with a great idea, and now I need someone to help me execute it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's why you've come to me?
::'''Boyang:''' Well, I was planning to ask Sushang for help, but she was too busy. So I was wondering if I could perhaps trouble you instead?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I know nothing about antiques...
::'''Boyang:''' It's simple. I wouldn't have asked you if my little cycrane could do it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This would be a risky leap. Think twice before you act.
::'''Boyang:''' No worries. It'll only take me a dozen years to try it out and see if this plan works. And if it doesn't, I can always go back to selling fandangles.
:'''Boyang:''' Honestly, I've tried it before, but my customer base just slowly disappeared over time.
:'''Boyang:''' At first, I thought it was just bad luck, but then the same thing happened in my fandangles circle as well. So I started asking around, and I found out... tsk...
:'''Boyang:''' It turns out that some ignorant Outworlders have been spreading rumors that I don't know anything about antiques and that I've been selling fake antiques. That's how my reputation got tarnished.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not selling fake antiques, are you?
::'''Boyang:''' Come on! How could I even do that? Even if I wanted to, the Realm-Keeping Commission wouldn't let me get away with it. All the stores on the Xianzhou ship have to follow the rules and regulations.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, you do give off the impression that you know nothing about antiques.
::'''Boyang:''' Hey! It's unfair to judge someone solely based on their appearance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you just close your shop and inherit your family fortune?
::'''Boyang:''' If I were to do that, I wouldn't even have a place for my fellow curio enthusiasts.
:'''Boyang:''' You just don't get it. I mean, I was born and raised on this Xianzhou ship, and I just can't wrap my head around how those Outworlders define "antiques."
:'''Boyang:''' Some fandangles made a few decades ago can have amazing craftsmanship, but those outsiders don't even consider them to be true antiques. Meanwhile, some fandangles made centuries ago are so dilapidated that I have to repaint them to make them presentable, but then those same outsiders accuse me of destroying antiques.
:'''Boyang:''' I mean, what's the big deal between antiques from decades ago and centuries ago? It's all just a fleeting amount of time, isn't it?
:'''Boyang:''' Thankfully, Mingxi heard about my predicament and helped me. She lent me a Diting that allows me to figure out the origin year of my fandangles.
:'''Boyang:''' Now all I need is a little boost in popularity, and that's why I'm planning to host a treasure appraisal event right in front of my store.
:'''Boyang:''' Here's the plan: I'll place the antiques to be appraised at the door and use Diting to figure out their origin year. If they were made just a few decades ago, I'll smash them. That way, only antiques made centuries ago would be left in my store.
:'''Boyang:''' Now I need you to help me with the rehearsal so that I'll know what the real event will be like.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I don't even have antiques. How am I supposed to appraise them?
::'''Boyang:''' No need to worry about that. I've brought out a whole bunch of antiques and ordinary fandangles from my family's warehouse, so you'll have plenty to smash at the upcoming show!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, all I need to do is to smash them all?
::'''Boyang:''' No, no. You'll need to use Diting to find out the true antiques and smash only the fake ones.
:'''Boyang:''' Hold on a second. Let me show you the antiques we'll be using in the event.
----
:'''Boyang:''' Try it yourself and you'll see what it's all about.
:'''Boyang:''' Here, I got this Diting through some connections. This little guy will help you figure out the origin year of objects, so you'll know which antiques to smash.
:'''Boyang:''' Follow its guidance and you won't make mistakes. Well, just try it yourself and you'll see what to do.

:'''Boyang:''' Activate your Diting and use its "Appraise" feature on these jars.
:'''Boyang:''' While "Appraise" is activated, the jar that responds is the genuine one, and the other is the fake one.

:'''Curious Outworlder:''' No, I don't think it has anything to do with IPC. A local Luofu event, it seems.
