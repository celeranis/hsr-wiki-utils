::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 158.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' But you don't deny that the dock was vital to your operations, correct? Your partnership with the shop owners and the increase in cargo handling capacity &mdash; none of it would have been possible without the dock.

::(Continue questioning)
::{{A|VO side2 jrx player 135 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 jrx player 135 f.ogg}} '''(Trailblazer):''' How are interastral cargo ships supposed to dock? There isn't enough room.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 161.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' To address this, most of the shops will need to be relocated.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 162.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' The IPC will redesign the layout of the whole area to make sure ships can move in and out smoothly. We expect at least the same trading volume as Cloudford.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 163.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' Rest assured, all the shops that need relocating will receive generous compensation from the IPC. The package we've prepared will make everyone happy.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx sushang 277.ogg}} '''Sushang:''' Classic IPC...
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 154.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' And that, honorable ladies and gentlemen, is the rejuvenation that everyone has been hoping for.

::{{A|VO side2 jrx mingxi 239.ogg}} '''Mingxi:''' According to the poll we conducted earlier with business owners, most of them have already partnered with the Merchant Guild and wish to preserve their current business model. Artistry Hardware is among the shops that registered this answer.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 166.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' ...Father has never been the shrewdest when it comes to business matters. I'm afraid his opinions don't constitute the most valuable insights.
::{{A|VO side2 jrx xiaohan 167.ogg}} '''Xiaohan:''' In agreeing with your approach, those shops may risk missing the bigger picture... and opportunities for future growth.
