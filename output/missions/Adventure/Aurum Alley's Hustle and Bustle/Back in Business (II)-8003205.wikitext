{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|Miss Secretary seems to have something urgent to tell you. It can't be Skott's reckoning, can it?<br />The revival of Aurum Alley is no easy task, and you're beginning to feel the full weight of the efforts demanded.}}

===Head to Oldies Depot and learn about the president's viewpoint{{subst:void|<!--800320502-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|The IPC is trying to stop the revival of Aurum Alley in order to obtain the developmental rights for the area for themselves, but what does the president desire out of this situation? Perhaps only he can explain his own motive.<br />Head to Oldies Depot and ask him. He's been hiding in a shop filled with second-hand goods all this time &mdash; he can't possibly be a second-hand good himself, right?}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|As the overseer of the Xianzhou Luofu's commercial activities, Madam Yukong has also arrived in this humble Aurum Alley to give you some recommendations. Say "thank you" to Madam Yukong, quickly!<br />Some of the Aurum Alley merchants are displeased with the merchant guild, but as you are an outside party, you can demonstrate new possibilities that might win their confidence.}}
