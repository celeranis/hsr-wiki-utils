;(Talk to Mingxi)
:{{A|VO side2 jrx mingxi 214.ogg}} '''Mingxi:''' Thanks to your help, the dock is running at full capacity. Just like last time, I told the workers to clear out areas that weren't utilized and use them to store extra cargo.
:{{A|VO side2 jrx mingxi 215.ogg}} '''Mingxi:''' We now have the additional capacity to work with more businesses and have also opened a new route leading to the port. With streamlined logistics planning, I think we'll see a revitalized Alley in no time!
