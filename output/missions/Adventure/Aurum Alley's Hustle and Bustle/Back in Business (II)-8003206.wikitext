===Speak with Mr. Xiao at Artistry Hardware===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|Yukong told you that you need to "reassemble" the merchant guild's representatives. If you can convince Mr. Xiao, you'll win the support of many business owners.<br />Mr. Xiao is the owner of Artistry Hardware. Head there and speak with him.}}

===Fix the broken cycrane as an apprentice===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Xiaohan recommended that you pose as an apprentice to get close to Mr. Xiao. Most of these craftsmen are harsh of words but soft of heart. Maybe after you wear them down, the talks will get smoother as well.<br />But this method rests entirely on the foundations of you providing free labor. You should get a cycrane fixed first. If you keep trying to repair it, the whole thing might seem a bit rude.}}

===Leave Artistry Hardware and plan your next step===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Mr. Xiao is steadfast in his decision. Inquiring further might just lead nowhere.<br />You can leave first and make new plans after.}}

Next, it's time for the old teacher to speak.}}

===Complete the logistics planning and speak with Mingxi===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Mr. Xiao is fed up with Aurum Alley's stagnancy and forced himself to believe that the IPC would provide a better future. However, now he has a new choice in the form of the "Aurum Alley Revival Project."<br />Mr. Xiao has agreed to establish business relations with the docks, and the merchant guild should also offer something back by including Artistry Hardware into their plans.}}
