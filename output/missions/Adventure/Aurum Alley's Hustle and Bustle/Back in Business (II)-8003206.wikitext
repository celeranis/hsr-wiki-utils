{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|Xiaohan recommended that you pose as an apprentice to get close to Mr. Xiao. Most of these craftsmen are harsh of words but soft of heart. Maybe after you wear them down, the talks will get smoother as well.<br />But this method rests entirely on the foundations of you providing free labor. You should get a cycrane fixed first. If you keep trying to repair it, the whole thing might seem a bit rude.}}
