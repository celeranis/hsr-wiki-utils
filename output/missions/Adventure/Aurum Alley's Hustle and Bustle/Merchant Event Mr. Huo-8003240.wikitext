:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Thanks for bringing it all this way. Put those "goods" over here then.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Huo never mentioned anything about a collection...
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Mr. Huo never mentioned a lot of things to you, kid. Just hand it over.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A Cloud Knight wants "Mr. Huo's goods"?
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Uh, yeah. Why not?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No way. I insist on sending via a cycrane.
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Do you even understand the words I am saying to you? Hand it over.
:'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I don't want to trouble you, so just put the "goods" down, turn around, and walk away. Otherwise, don't blame me if I start playing hardball.

:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' You, stop. I still have some words to say.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You let me go, and now you're trying to back out of it?
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I'm reneging on it.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was just thinking about how suspicious you seemed. So go ahead.
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' You really think I'm suspicious? If that's so, I would not have come here looking for you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Captain, I'm really just here to deliver the "goods."
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I know. you're really just here to deliver the "goods."
:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' ...Wait a minute. Hear me out.
:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' You are too trusting of other people. Is everyone wearing the "Cloud Knight" armor in fact a "Cloud Knight"?
:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I told you to let it go and you just did it. You even just left like that &mdash; didn't you have the slightest of suspicions?
:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' I can't bear to trick you like this, so let me tell you: I've been hired to test you, and I'm not a real "Cloud Knight."
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm touched. I guess you really are a good person after all?
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' Don't be touched. You have to learn something from this lesson.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What!? You dare try and cheat me?
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' It's you who wasn't vigilant enough. You should pay more attention to those anti-scam ads from the Realm-Keeping Commission.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew that all along. I just didn't care.
::::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' The nerve of some people... When people ask you to do something, you should assume a modicum of responsibility.
:::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' C'mon, take back your "goods" and finish what you were meant to do.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Take a closer look at this Cloud Knight before you)
::'''Cloud Knights Soldier:''' What are you looking at? Never seen a Cloud Knight before?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait a sec, you are no Cloud Knight!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you know I have the goods?
