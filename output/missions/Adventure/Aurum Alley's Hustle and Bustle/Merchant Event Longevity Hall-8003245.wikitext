:'''Mingxi:''' I didn't expect to hear you "debating" here... As far as the verdict was concerned, you won, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You'll have to ask Qingque.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fu Xuan the diviner will thank me.
:'''Qingque:''' I won't put Little Tian out anymore then, but I'll keep asking for leave. I'll go back and have another think about it.
:'''Mingxi:''' Little Tian just agreed to collaborate with the docks. (Trailblazer), please add Longevity Hall into the logistics plan. This way, the docks can get some new orders soon.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's get the planning started.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I love planning stuff. I wanna do it now!

:'''Little Tian:''' Actually before you came, (Trailblazer), I contacted Miss Secretary. Really sorry for not mentioning that to you.
:'''Little Tian:''' Our humble Longevity Hall really doesn't need any logistics. I just want to express my allegiance, that's all. I hope you and the Aurum Alley Merchant Guild can kick out those arrogant brutes from the IPC. Really show them who's the boss around here.
:'''Qingque:''' The merchants in Aurum Alley are enthusiastic. I thought everyone would be as laid back as Ruoyue about it.
:'''Qingque:''' I'll get going then, Little Tian. You keep working at it. You can do it. And afterward, let's play a few hands of celestial jade.
:'''Little Tian:''' Cool cool, I'll see you at the games table.
