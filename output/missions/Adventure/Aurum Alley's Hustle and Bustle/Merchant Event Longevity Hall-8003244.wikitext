:'''Little Tian:''' Miss Qingque, you can't always come to me for a medical certificate. This is a pharmacy. We don't do diagnosis.
:'''Qingque:''' Little Tian, you always gave me a medical certificate before. You can't just turn off the tap now!
:'''Qingque:''' No, I've contracted an incurable disease. Little Tian, you have to save me. You're from the Alchemy Commission, right?
:'''Little Tian:''' Miss Qingque, you know how the Alchemy Commission is. If you've got an incurable disease, go and see them there!
:'''Qingque:''' The Alchemy Commission can't diagnose my disease, Little Tian. Can you help me pick out a little ailment that won't spill the beans for me?
:'''Little Tian:''' Just say that you're lazy, and you'll never have to reveal anything.
:'''Qingque:''' If I could use laziness as an excuse on a medical certificate, I would &mdash; but you know I can't.
:'''Little Tian:''' ...
:'''Little Tian:''' I've got a customer. Hold on a second.
:'''Qingque:''' Well, if it isn't (Trailblazer), my {{MC|f=good sister|m=good brother}}.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (Little Tian seems to be asking for help with her eyes...)

;(Talk to Little Tian)
:'''Little Tian:''' You're here! I heard that your guild is trying to port merchants onto the logistics platform... I was actually thinking of signing up, but only on one condition: Can you please help me handle this Qingque lady?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I know what's going on here.
:::'''Little Tian:''' That's great. Then it looks like we have a deal.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} These are two separate things. Don't mix them up.
:::'''Little Tian:''' "Making a deal with the docks" and "getting Miss Qingque to give up her quest for a medical certificate" are now the same thing.
:::'''Little Tian:''' Please, I'm desperate here.
::'''Little Tian:''' Don't worry. I'm not some lazy taskmaster. I know you need some evidence to refute her. Let's see what I have here.
;(Return to previous option selection)

;(Talk to Qingque)
:'''Qingque:''' Hey, I know you're here to persuade me to give up my delusion so I can get back to work. But this time is different. I really need an excuse to ditch work.
::'''Qingque:''' The diviner in charge of scheduling made a mistake, and all the divinations ended up getting delayed. And knowing how angry the master diviner would be, with a swipe of the pen, that diviner tried to frame us with that workload...
::'''Qingque:''' According to the current plan, a month's work now has to be done in half a month. Every diviner at the Divination Commission has fallen victim to this "delayed workload"...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think this is your problem.
:::'''Qingque:''' I agree that I shouldn't have to pay for other people's mistakes.
:::'''Qingque:''' But, that diviner put it nicely &mdash; "We are a collective! Knuckle down, work hard, and there's nothing we can't get done!"
:::'''Qingque:''' Anyway, she's just a supervisor and would never roll her sleeves up and get her hands dirty.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should go on strike! Stand up for yourselves!
:::'''Qingque:''' If we do that, I won't even be able to draw a salary.
:::'''Qingque:''' If I had the courage for that, what would I need to get a healer's note?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you really going to ask for sick leave at a time like this?
:::'''Qingque:''' The Divination Commission needs everyone in a crisis like this &mdash; except a sick Qingque!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But a medical certificate can't beat everything.
::'''Qingque:''' I get what you mean. You think my job is useless.
::'''Qingque:''' How about this: I'll take a medical certificate, and you play the role of "sick leave auditor-diviner." C'mon, let's play it out.
::'''Qingque:''' If my excuse is watertight, then you've no right to stop me. But if my reason is deemed groundless...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then you can give up on the thought of taking leave.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come up with a better excuse!
::'''Qingque:''' Deal.
:'''Qingque:''' Go ahead and see Little Tian first. I'm in no rush. I'll just wait here.
