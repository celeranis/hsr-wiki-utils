===Learn how to negotiate at Oldies Depot===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Aurum Alley|update|It seems like Skott was already prepared when he started to act weird. Considering you'll need to negotiate with him down the line, he's clearly going to be a bit of a problem. Thankfully, Miss Secretary remembered that the mysterious Merchant Guild President is around. The president should be able to teach us all sorts of negotiation techniques!<br />Come to think about it, it might be Lianyan operating in place of the president again. You're already pretty used to the secrecy the president seems to maintain.}}
