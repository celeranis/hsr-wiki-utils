;(Talk to Mingxi)
:{{A|VO side2 jrx mingxi 180.ogg}} '''Mingxi:''' Thanks to your help, the lease was paid off and the dock capacity is increasing. I told the workers to clear out areas that weren't utilized and use them to store extra cargo.
:{{A|VO side2 jrx mingxi 181.ogg}} '''Mingxi:''' Now the dock can support collaboration with more businesses. Let's keep working together for the revival of Aurum Alley!
