;(Talk to Boyang)
:{{Black Screen|As the onlookers gradually scatter, you notice that Mingxi had already arrived at Elegance Pagoda.}}
:'''Boyang:''' Oh, I just can't thank you enough.
:'''Boyang:''' Thanks to your performance, my reputation has taken a turn for the better. I'm sure the business will improve over time.
:'''Mingxi:''' That was fantastic. Boyang and I have worked out all the details of our cooperation. (Trailblazer), please add Elegance Pagoda into the logistics plan so the docks can get some new orders.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's get the planning started.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I love planning stuff. I wanna do it now!

:'''Boyang:''' Oh, what a pleasant surprise! I've been receiving orders via my jade abacus just as we're talking!
:'''Boyang:''' I'm so grateful to you and Miss Secretary for all your help. With the dock provided by the guild, shipping will become more convenient... Oops, sorry, I got a bit too caught up in business talk. Anyway, I should probably go attend to my customers now. Thanks again, and I'll see you later!
:{{Black Screen|Thanks to your aid, more and more people are visiting Elegance Pagoda.}}

::'''Boyang:''' Welcome to my Elegance Pagoda, dear customer! All the fandangles here are carefully prepared by myself.
::'''Boyang:''' Please feel free to take a look if anything catches your attention. Just, please don't touch them.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's that supposed to mean, huh?
:::'''Boyang:''' I apologize if my words caused a misunderstanding. That's not what I meant.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} These fandangles must be incredibly expensive, I guess?
:::'''Boyang:''' No, that is hardly the case. These curios are carefully prepared for those who are "destined" to become their new masters.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your rules are really weird...
:::'''Boyang:''' I apologize for the inconvenience, but these rules have been in place in our circle for decades, as reserving fandangles is always a painstaking endeavor.
::'''Boyang:''' For example, some of them must be kept at constant temperature and humidity, and different fandangles have different requirements for storage conditions. That's why I have to prohibit my clients from touching what we have worked so hard to preserve.
::'''Boyang:''' If you so happen to be destined for one, I'll place it in a bright place and bring a magnifying glass and gloves to you. Then you can admire it to your heart's content.
::'''Boyang:''' Has anything piqued your interest?
