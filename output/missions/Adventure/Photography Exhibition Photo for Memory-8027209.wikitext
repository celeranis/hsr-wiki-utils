:'''March 7th:''' And with that, this photography exhibition comes to a close.
::'''March 7th:''' In these seven days, we photographed Penacony's streets and stage, then we got Sparkle's lens and returned to the Xianzhou to take all sorts of bizarre photos... Now that I've calmed down, I really do feel a bit out of sorts.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The voyage continues...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The road to becoming a master photographer never ends, either!
::'''March 7th:''' Yeah! You're totally right, (Trailblazer)!
::'''March 7th:''' It's not just the instant that the photos captured, but the many things that happened between photos... As the photos stack up, the portion of my life when I had no memories seems to get smaller and smaller...
::'''March 7th:''' Ahem, the Express is about to depart! Next stop, we're gonna keep snapping even more, even better photographs!
::'''March 7th:''' Here's a copy of the group photo, (Trailblazer). You'd better not lose it!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We'll take it.
