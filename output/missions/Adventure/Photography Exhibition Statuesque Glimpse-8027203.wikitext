:'''March 7th:''' (Trailblazer), come up with a name for this photo!
:"Disco Youth."
:'''March 7th:''' Hmm... Sounds like a name that suits its time.
:"Rise of the Eyas."
:'''March 7th:''' Hmm... It evokes a feeling full of hope for the future.
:"Trailblazing is Bird-Brained."
:'''March 7th:''' Such a disrespectful name. If the conductor catches wind of this, they'll eject us from the Express!
:'''March 7th:''' Upload complete! Huh, what's over there?
:Just in sight, a familiar marble statue stands in stoic silence. Its owner must still be nearby.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' I know what to take next. C'mon, let's take a look over there!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This could be the power of Trailblaze.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Trailbirder was born to trailblaze!
:{{tx}}
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Go closer and try it... He should be near the statue.
:'''March 7th:''' Follow the statue's directions and look around.
