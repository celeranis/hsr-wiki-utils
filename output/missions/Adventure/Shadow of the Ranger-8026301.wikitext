{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Geed)
:'''Contract Robot:''' Is there anything I can do to help, fam?
::Check sales.
::Nothing else.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You were looking for me?
::'''Geed:''' Yes yes, I was. My wait is finally over. I heard that the Astral Express traveled to Penacony before? I've been meaning to ask you about some matters.
::'''Geed:''' ...You heard of an interstellar cowboy named Boothill?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, that's an old friend of mine.
:::'''Geed:''' Wow, you're so cool, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}! But you should probably forget about this exchange outside the space station &mdash; you don't want to run into any future trouble.
:::Heard of him, don't really know him.
:::'''Geed:''' Okay... I hear his bounty is still going up. If you've seen him, you can probably get quite a hefty reward. Ah, what a pity...
:::Many have been asking about him...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Heard of him, don't really know him.
:::'''Geed:''' Okay... I hear his bounty is still going up. If you've seen him, you can probably get quite a hefty reward. Ah, what a pity...
:::Many have been asking about him...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Many have been asking about him...
::'''Geed:''' Your memory's quite something, eh, heh-heh... I knew it, a special assignment from the IPC, definitely a grand opportunity off the beaten path, oh so precious...
::'''Geed:''' All right. I'll stop trying to bait you. Everyone's been trying to find his whereabouts. Just a little while ago, I heard some guys went to Penacony to try their luck in catching him.
::'''Geed:''' Bah, this Boothill certainly does know how to stir up a sandstorm &mdash; he hired a whole horde of lackeys... It was sheer, unmitigated chaos.
::'''Geed:''' Good thing my big bro Wen Shiqi is smart. Like he always says: "The more chaotic a situation is, the greater the chance of us profiting." I heard you recently went to Penacony too, so I contracted a special assignment with him.
::'''Geed:''' This assignment is to collect all recent intel related to Boothill on Penacony, and then filter out all unrelated information. Which is why we need a bold and astute person who can freely enter and exit Penacony to do this &mdash; I thought you'd be perfect for this job.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's your commission?
:::'''Geed:''' Zero. I mainly wish to broaden my network, not try to make any money off you. Lead Researcher Asta also warned us that we aren't allowed to take advantage of you.
:::Betraying a Galaxy Ranger violates the code of justice...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Betraying a Galaxy Ranger violates the code of justice...
::'''Geed:''' Don't worry. With such a grand bounty on Boothill, I doubt he's in any actual peril. That lot most likely can't subdue him, and we're just making nickels on the dime here.
::'''Geed:''' Okay, I've just sent you the details on the terminal. You can pore over the file on your own &mdash; it's not wise to be so ostentatious in the space station.
::{{tx}}
:'''Geed:''' Shh, you shouldn't breathe a word about this special assignment. Just keep it to ourselves and make bank, otherwise people are going to say that our department's goofing off again.
