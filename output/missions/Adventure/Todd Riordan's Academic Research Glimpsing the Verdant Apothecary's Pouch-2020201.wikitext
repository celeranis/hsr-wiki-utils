;(Talk to Todd)
:'''Todd:''' Chat? Alright, I can use a break now anyway. Besides, chatting with different people aboard Xianzhou also forms part of my research.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What does the Intelligentsia Guild do?
::'''Todd:''' I may be a student there, but my opinion of the Intelligentsia Guild is bound to be biased. So take this with a grain of salt.
::'''Todd:''' Put simply, the Intelligentsia Guild is an academic organization in symbiosis with the Interastral Peace Corporation. Our motto is "All knowledge must be circulated as freely as currency."
::'''Todd:''' Our scholars traverse the universe collecting all knowledge of value, and trading learnings with other scholars in the hope of attaining priceless wisdom.
::'''Todd:''' It's hard to explain, but basically, all you need to know is that we're a group that trades knowledge to gain true wisdom.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Don't the Xianzhou natives research history?
::'''Todd:''' It's not that they don't study it. It's just that what they call "history" is a completely different concept from what our short-life species consider to be history.
::'''Todd:''' It's a simple concept. Would you consider the abandoned theater that you used to visit as a child as some kind of archaeological ruin? What we consider to be ancient history is merely a childhood memory for the long-lived Xianzhou natives.
::'''Todd:''' That's why the Xianzhou natives don't really value their own cultural relics, just as we don't really care about dilapidated buildings back home. They also don't really get the concept of written history, because "history" still lives within their memories.
::'''Todd:''' But everything must come to an eventual end one day, and the Xianzhou natives are no exception. As a student of the Intelligentsia Guild, how can I sit idly by? They don't care, but I do &mdash; so I'm here to record the magnificence of our cosmos's history.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What's your purpose behind doing all of this?
::'''Todd:''' You sound just like one of my tutors! *sigh* That reminds me of school and having to find a practical purpose for every academic topic I wanted to write about...
::'''Todd:''' Cough, ahem... but of course, it's useful to study the history of Xianzhou. After all, we all know that the secret of immortality lies hidden somewhere here. The Xianzhou natives might be able to keep their secret, but history shall never be kept silent.
::'''Todd:''' So long as we can piece together enough clues from the rubble and scraps around us, perhaps it'll lead us to finding that legendary secret here on Xianzhou...
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all, I can see you're busy.
::'''Todd:''' Yes, let us part ways here. If you see any interesting historical relics, give me a holler.

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|To take without permission is considered stealing.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Recount Todd's request)
:'''Yuluo:''' ''Compendium of Remedies''? The Intelligentsia Guild's application?
:'''Yuluo:''' I see. It was something Lady Dan Shu approved when she still held the post... Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't call her "Lady" anymore.
:'''Yuluo:''' I don't want to change her policies, but you must've heard about her crimes, right? The Cloud Knights are thoroughly investigating the commission, and even our day-to-day job as healers are being affected...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So it's not going to work?
::'''Yuluo:''' *sigh* I don't think Dan Shu's crimes should influence the academic work being carried out in the commission.
::'''Yuluo:''' But rules are rules. After what happened in the Alchemy Commission, everything has to be re-approved.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright. I'll go and decline Todd's offer.
::'''Yuluo:''' These medical textbooks are not highly confidential files, nor do they contain forbidden knowledge.
::'''Yuluo:''' But I'm not the one who made the rules. After what happened in the Alchemy Commission, every exchange request has to be re-approved.
:'''Yuluo:''' I just came back from a foreign business trip myself. The Alchemy Commission had experienced a huge upheaval and armed conflict. Everything is a mess. So many books have been displaced from the bookshelves.
:'''Yuluo:''' I even saw some books {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|hanging off trees}}.
:Yuluo smiles at you.
:'''Yuluo:''' I still need to continue making inventory. If there is nothing else, let's talk another time.

::'''Learned Alchemist:''' The medical texts that outworlders have access to would never contain the name of such a forbidden entity.
::'''Learned Alchemist:''' Hmph! If you're not a Sanctus Medicus disciple, then you must have met the master primus and received her prescriptions.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Tell the truth) Dan Shu's prescription...
::'''Learned Alchemist:''' I never thought the master primus gifted this prescription to the Guild. How surprising. It's a pity that the short-life species would never understand the secrets behind this ingredient.
:'''Learned Alchemist:''' Let me tell you the truth. This is nothing less than the overgrowth on the bodies of mara-struck Xianzhou natives. You cannot obtain this ingredient without killing Xianzhou humans.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure know a lot about this...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a remnant of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus?
:'''Learned Alchemist:''' The master primus was martyred, and the disciples all scattered. I had no choice but to hide as well.
:'''Learned Alchemist:''' I can pretend this never happened today, but if you don't want the Cloud Knights or the Ten-Lords Commission giving you trouble, you better leave right now. Otherwise... I can't make any promises.
