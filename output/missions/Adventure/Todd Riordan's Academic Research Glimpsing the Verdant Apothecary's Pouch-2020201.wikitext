{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Scholar Todd Riordan of the Intelligentsia Guild seems to have encountered a problem with his research.

===Borrow ''Compendium of Remedies'' from the healers at the Alchemy Commission{{subst:void|<!--202020103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|Todd intends to obtain the Alchemy Commission's medical book, ''Compendium of Remedies''. It's not shameful for a scholar to seek knowledge, but unfortunately he has to send you to the Alchemy Commission to fetch it for him.}}

===Speak with Yuluo and inquire the location of the ''Compendium of Remedies''{{subst:void|<!--202020104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|To take without permission is considered stealing. Since it's about obtaining a medical book, it is necessary to obtain permission from the current chief alchemist of the Alchemy Commission. I don't know if the newly appointed chief alchemist, Yuluo, will be agreeable to this request. Ah well, let's just go and ask.}}

===Look for the ''Compendium of Remedies'' inside the Alchemy Commission{{subst:void|<!--202020105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|After the chaos in the Alchemy Commission, all applications need to be re-evaluated. Although Yuluo refused you, you found out that the ''Compendium of Remedies'' is not on the bookshelf. Perhaps, you should take a chance and look around nearby?}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|In the midst of the conflict, medical books were scattered all over the place. After several obstacles, you finally managed to gather the ''Compendium of Remedies'' that Todd wanted. Hurry and bring the book back to him.}}

===Head to the Alchemy Commission again to ask the healers about the herb{{subst:void|<!--202020107-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Alchemy Commission|update|What a surprise. Todd actually has some knowledge in the Alchemy Commission's prescriptions. After obtaining the ''Compendium of Remedies'', he realized he was unfamiliar with a medicinal herb called Divine Aureate Twig... His research progress has thus been stalled. Therefore, he asked you to go to the Alchemy Commission to ask the healers about it on his behalf.}}

===Hand over the herbs to Todd{{subst:void|<!--202020110-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Surprisingly, the Divine Aureate Twig is this thing. Can this really be used as medicine? Perhaps this is the mystical aspect of the Alchemy Commission's medical skills... Although the process of obtaining the medicinal herb was somewhat tortuous, in any case, you have obtained it. Hurry and bring it to Todd.}}
