:{{DIcon|?}} Janus' Steed
:There is no doubt about it. The giant wooden prop before you is one you recognize from an old story. Its head raised high in the sky and room in its stomach for several people &mdash; it has all the familiar characteristics you expect.
:You cannot understand why this would appear here. This wooden horse could only feasibly be connected to the {{Rubi|Janus|Passage Titan}}, but the Temple of the Three Fates has long since fallen into ruin, and that child-like demigod is nowhere to be seen.
:You look around you, but there is no one in sight. It seems that it is up to you to investigate...

::You look around you, but there is no one in sight. It seems that it is up to you to investigate...
::(Climb inside the wooden horse's stomach)
::This is not something a Nameless should be doing!
::...Really? I had no idea you were so faithful to your duty as a Trailblazer. But just think about all of those trash cans you've flipped over, all of those street lamps you've investigated over and over, the countless shields you've smashed... Are you really not going to go inside and take a look?
::(Climb inside the wooden horse's stomach)
::Never mind.
::If {{Rubi|Georios|Earth Titan}} were here, your diligence and self-control would have no doubt been commended. Unfortunately, there was no response. Although, you still have plenty of time to consider what action to take.
::The inside of the wooden horse is even more spacious than you imagined. There is a faint warmth to it and you can stretch out comfortably. Just as you are investigating the most comfortable position to lie down in, a voice suddenly comes from outside &mdash;
::'''??:''' Great Gate of Infinity! Janus! I know that your divinity has not been eradicated, that you still roam the ruins of our past world!
::'''??:''' If you can hear your disciple's prayer, please give me a sign. Please... knock on this wood three times and show that you are here.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Knock on the inside of the wooden horse three times)
:::Knock, knock, knock... The crisp knocking sound echoes through the temple. The sound is ethereal and drawn-out, as if it had originated from a distant space-time.
:::'''??:''' Janus above! You have responded to me! Praise your kindness and mercy!
:::'''??:''' I request your divine foresight. I am lost in confusion and wish for your revelation. Please do not remain silent in the face of the struggles of the world. If you refuse to enlighten me, I shall remain right here until the threads of destiny are cut and the temple collapses around me!
:::...Right, looks like this disciple is far more persistent than you could have imagined. How will you respond?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Do nothing)
:::You just wanted to find a quiet place to lie down. When it comes to answering the prayers of disciples, leave that to the noble folks who are willing to devote themselves to their holy calling. You turn over, trying to find a more comfortable position.
:::...At that very moment, your baseball bat falls from your pocket and happens to strike the frame of the wooden horse.

:::...Right, looks like this disciple is far more persistent than you could have imagined. How will you respond?
:::You gently tap the wooden wall a few times, trying to convey this message to your disciple &mdash; You are a gentle and forgiving god. You care for the people of this world and are willing to listen to any request your believers may have.
:::'''??:''' Ah, I knew it! You never abandoned us! When in the presence of a miracle, it is only right for me to bow before you. These are your favorite items. I present them before this miracle for you to enjoy as a sign of my reverence. See, they are all here for you.
:::'''??:''' Now that your godly will is revealed, I too shall confess my concern. Soon, I am to go to Grove of Epiphany on official business. Before I leave Okhema, I need to know... Should I step out of the city with my left or right foot?
:::Thinking about it, this is the first time that you have been approached as a god. This is your first ever divine prophecy, and it is for such an inane question? You cannot help but feel rage growing inside you, so you...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Slam wildly on the left side wall)
::::'''??:''' Left, left, left... And another left! I understand. You wish for me to step out on my left foot, correct? Thank you for your guidance!

::::'''??:''' You aren't responding... Are you tired? ...Are you still there? Hello... Hello...?
::::'''??:''' Even the great Gate of Infinity, the mighty Janus, falls silent before this quandary. Perhaps... I should not go to the Grove of the Muses?
::::'''??:''' My concerns have been answered. I will disturb you no longer. Your offerings are before your miraculous shrine, and I hope that you will enjoy them.
::::You wait a considerable while until you hear no further sound from the outside. Confident that the loyal disciple had gone, you gently push the trap door open and go to take a breath of fresh air, when...
