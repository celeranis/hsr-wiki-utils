:'''Major:''' Drillmaster (Trailblazer)! I never thought we'd be meeting again so soon!
:'''Major:''' Bwahaha!
:{{DIcon}} Where the aide at?
::'''Major:''' That punk can't handle drills of this scale in the restricted zone!
:{{DIcon}} So you're the one calling the shots this time?
::'''Major:''' That's right! You'll have to rely on me to handle drills of this scale in the restricted zone!
:'''Major:''' Here, let me explain to you the goal of this restricted zone drill!
:'''Major:''' Facing invaders from the Fragmentum, we sometimes have no other choice but to rely on strength in numbers to fight back.
:'''Major:''' This time, Drillmaster (Trailblazer), I'll leave it to you to test the mettle of these Silvermane Guards!
:'''Major:''' You'll have to {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|defeat forty Silvermane Guards}} in the restricted zone! That's right. You can only pass this challenge once you've hit that number!
:{{DIcon}} Forty?
::'''Major:''' That's right! Bwahaha!
:{{DIcon}} I'm starting to regret this...
::'''Major:''' Too late! Bwahaha!
:'''Major:''' One more thing! I heard Captain Gepard plans on joining this drill, too...
:'''Major:''' But he wasn't there when we were setting things up. Who knows when he'll join in on the drill?
:'''Major:''' Get going, Drillmaster (Trailblazer)! It's up to you to teach these rookie chumps a lesson!

:'''Gepard:''' Thanks for sparring with the Silvermane Guards, (Trailblazer). This combat experience really is invaluable for us.
:'''Gepard:''' In doing this, you've actually saved the lives of many new recruits. On behalf of all the Silvermane Guards in the restricted zone, I would like to extend my highest respects to you.
:{{DIcon}} Really, I'm no big shot...
::'''Gepard:''' Have you ever heard the line, "Judge someone on their actions, not their thoughts"?
:{{DIcon}} Glad I could help.
