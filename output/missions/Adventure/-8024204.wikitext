:Looking at the man before you, you're shocked that Litter Pony would call him along for this... Would you consider him your "friend"?
::'''Sampo:''' Woah, if it isn't (Trailblazer), my favorite customer!
::'''Sampo:''' You came to the right person for a Proof of Friendship! I'm your trustworthy old Sampo after all, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you really see trust when you look in my eyes?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Sampo" and "trustworthy" have the opposite meaning.
::'''Sampo:''' My friend, how can you be so cruel? Think about it. Isn't the essence of friendship just mutual benefit?
::'''Sampo:''' No matter how you look at it, our relationship meets the standard definition of "friendship" in every way. You pay with money, and I pay with effort. Is this not friendship in its purest, most perfect form?
::'''Litter Pony:''' I can't say that sounds pure to me, but I still sense... a bittersweet friendship between you.
::'''Litter Pony:''' (Trailblazer), how do you think you would be able to obtain your Proof of Friendship?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Strain to recall good points on Sampo)
:::You begin thinking back really hard on your past experiences with Sampo... As you do, you realize that there actually was that time when he saved you, Dan Heng, and March 7th from the Silvermane Guards.
:::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains Sampo's Magic of Friendship.
:::(Buy Proof of Friendship from Sampo)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Buy Proof of Friendship from Sampo)
::You pull out a stack of credits. In your mind, this is the most appropriate way to interact with Sampo.
::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains Sampo's Magic of Friendship.
::'''Sampo:''' That's more like it. Welcome to the adults' world!
::'''Litter Pony:''' Here, (Trailblazer). This is what you wanted &mdash; the stuff only adults can see.
