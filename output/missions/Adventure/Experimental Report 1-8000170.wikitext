;(Talk to Wen Shiling)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of Curio does Master Capote usually prefer?
::'''Wen Shiling:''' You're asking the right person. I've gotta be the only person in the space station who can answer this question!
::'''Wen Shiling:''' I know Master Capote's hobbies like the back of my hand. I even remember he adds three and a half cubes of sugar to his coffee.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' As for the Curios... Ehem, you think you can fool me into answering this? As I said, the Curios are distributed according to regulations, instead of the researcher's preferences!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is the Department of Implement Arts' regulations in terms of distributing Curios?
::'''Wen Shiling:''' It's... it's none of your business! The space station has its own rules and regulations, so does our department.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' The Curios I distribute to Master Capote are through the normal procedure. Don't think too much about it.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Anyway, the Department of Implement Arts is very busy. Don't ask around even if you don't believe me. Save us some troubles.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Jeez, I hate newbies like you who always try to get to the bottom of everything!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Give me a Curio, too.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Huh!? Do you even know what you're talking about? I can't just give a Curio to a random person!
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Except for Master Capote, no one gets Curios without going through the normal process. No one gets to choose Curios. You think a newbie like you can match Master Capote's knowledge and standard?
::'''Wen Shiling:''' ...
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Ehem, I mean, your researcher level is too low. You can't apply for a Curio for your research at the moment. Anything else is none of your business!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} That's all I have to ask.
::'''Wen Shiling:''' Phew, finally. I spent so much effort introducing the basics of the space station to you, but you're interested in things you shouldn't know!
