:The agreement was that you would borrow the Magic of Friendship from your Belobogian friends, but your "friends" are nowhere to be seen...
::'''Litter Pony:''' Alright, let's get started!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about my friends?
::'''Litter Pony:''' Ta-da! Your friend is me!
::'''Litter Pony:''' Look at the trashcans next to you... I am a consciousness born in the "Betweenwhere" after this trashcan was distorted.
::'''Litter Pony:''' No one ever paid me any mind. I was curled up in a corner as a can, silently at the mercy of the city's exhaust fumes.
::'''Litter Pony:''' Only you were willing to open me up and get familiar with my insides. My black plastic sack, my fish bones, my apple cores, every part of me...
::'''Litter Pony:''' You know my insides better than anyone. Surely you are not going to stand here and pretend we are no more than strangers, are you? You... {{MC|f=heartbreaker|m=jerk}}!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I will take responsibility!
:::'''Litter Pony:''' You know how to sweet talk when you need to. You must have broken many hearts in your time!
:::'''Litter Pony:''' Ah, guess I have no choice but to let it slide and make do.
:::I didn't! It wasn't me! Don't come any closer!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't! It wasn't me! Don't come any closer!
::'''Litter Pony:''' Quit trying to make excuses! I've seen your charming form as you dived into a trashcan up close and personal!
::'''Litter Pony:''' Let's show our Proof of Friendship! There's no time to explain. Open up the lid on my head and unleash that trashcan-diving vigor of yours...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Comply)
:::You unleash a combo that, at this point, you could do in your sleep.
:::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains (Trailblazer)'s Magic of Friendship.
:::(Refuse)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Refuse)
::Litter Pony does not care what you have to say. He flips open his lid and jumps to land upside-down on your head, spilling trash all over the surrounding area.
::With a bright flash of light, Litter Pony obtains (Trailblazer)'s Magic of Friendship.
::'''Litter Pony:''' The Magic of Friendship never lies. I knew we are best friends.
::'''Litter Pony:''' Now, my friend, let us battle side-by-side! Let us purify these terrible "Betweenwhere creatures"!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Enter Battle)
