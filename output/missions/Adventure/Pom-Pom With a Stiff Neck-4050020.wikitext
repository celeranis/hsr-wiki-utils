;(Talk to Researcher)
:'''Exhausted Researcher:''' I'm exhausted. Why are the researchers flocking to the medical cabin every day? This isn't the administration office!
:'''Exhausted Researcher:''' See, there's another one. If you're here to get a fake medical certificate from me, you can see yourself out now! My boss's been watching me closely lately, and there's no room for me to do such things!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Ask about stiff neck)
:'''Exhausted Researcher:''' Sounds like you're suffering from a stiff neck... Well, it isn't a big deal. Just apply a warm compress on your neck, take some painkillers, or massage your neck. Anyway, just avoid straining or spraining the muscles again.
:'''Exhausted Researcher:''' Come back if the pain persists. Just so you know, I won't give you a medical certificate for a problem as minor as that.
