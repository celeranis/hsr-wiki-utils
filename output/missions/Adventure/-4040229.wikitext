;(Talk to Think-Tank)
:'''Think-Tank:''' I recognized you straight away.
:'''Think-Tank:''' Hello there, I'm Think-Tank from the secret society Hexanexus. Think-Tank is just my code name in the club.
:'''Think-Tank:''' After all, it's just a secret society, and not even the rest of our Artisanship Commission colleagues know who our members are. We all call each other by our code names.
:'''Think-Tank:''' Sorry, I've been waffling on. You must have a lot of questions, so ask me whatever you'd like.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Are you really a secret society?
::'''Think-Tank:''' That's right. There used to be a group of us craftsmen in the Artisanship Commission who love the Hexanexus. But normies never really got us, so there's always someone trying to hate on us.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Later on, we set up this secret society in order to do one thing, and do it well&mdash;
::'''Think-Tank:''' To saturate the world with the Hexanexus! To let everyone immerse themselves in the pleasure of the Hexanexus.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} How do you guys find new recruits?
::'''Think-Tank:''' There're two main ways actually: One is called "social recruitment," and the other way is by "internal recommendation."
::'''Think-Tank:''' We call it social recruitment when there's someone on the roadside obsessing over the Hexanexus. This casts a wide net, but few candidates are successful.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Members also make recommendations among themselves, and if trustworthy members vouch for a new recruit, we call this recruitment an "internal recommendation." These candidates are trustworthy.
::'''Think-Tank:''' No matter which way you come to us, everyone MUST be passionate about the Hexanexus.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What other code names have you got in your secret society?
::'''Think-Tank:''' So you wanna know about our code names, huh...
::'''Think-Tank:''' Everyone's code name is pretty random. Some pick names themselves, like Storyteller, Danqing Artist, the Ingeniator...
::'''Think-Tank:''' And some just adopt a nickname that's been picked out by someone else, like me &mdash; Think-Tank. Lots of people have been "Think-Tanks" before.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why did you choose such an out-of-the-way place like this?
::'''Think-Tank:''' Well, we're a secret society, after all.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Besides, there's the Hexanexus nearby, so it's easier for us to link up over here.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's get down to business then.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Great, that's enough chit-chat. First off, I'd like to confer the title of Lifetime Hex Club Membership onto you. Congratulations.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Next, I'd like to ask you &mdash; in your opinion &mdash; how can we attract more recruits? How can we improve our next-day retention? How can we go viral?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't the Hexanexus a marvelous invention?
:::'''Think-Tank:''' However, as you can see, this whole time we've struggled to get anyone to play the Hexanexus. So this whole "secret society" is a way of tricking more people into playing it.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that what you mean by "Aspiring to Create Everything"?
::::'''Think-Tank:''' Well, that's just a slogan.
::::'''Think-Tank:''' Sorry, I didn't expect you to be such a perceptive person. I asked the wrong question.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't ask me. Ask an analyst.
::::'''Think-Tank:''' ...You have a point. I shouldn't be asking you about this.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have any answers to these questions of yours.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' Seems like I'm a little impatient for results here.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' These issues have been plaguing us forever, but I think I'm seeking answers from the wrong guy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Hexanexus gameplay is no good.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' ...I have a hard time agreeing with your point of view.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Then let me change the question. How can we make the Hexanexus even more fun?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Add in extra dimensions.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' Extra dimensions? We already have Virtual and Real. And... We could also put in some more decorative patterns.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not difficult enough.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' It's too easy!? If we added a pattern-matching element to the game, it should be even more difficult.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The device shape is too plain.
:::'''Think-Tank:''' The shape is too plain? If we add in some decorative patterning, that would maybe shake up things...
::'''Think-Tank:''' Okay, wait a second. I'm going to add some decorative patterns to this Hexanexus.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Why don't you give it a try now?

:'''Think-Tank:''' Why don't you give it a try now?
:'''Think-Tank:''' How about it, then? Is the Hexanexus even more fun now?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It really is more fun now.
::'''Think-Tank:''' That's great. This new Hexanexus model is gonna be a hit.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not too sure.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Give it a few more tries and you'll definitely come around to it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just the opposite &mdash; it's less fun now.
::'''Think-Tank:''' I don't believe it. Let me make a few more custom changes for you.
:'''Think-Tank:''' You really are a Hexanexus power tester! These suggestions of yours are simply illuminating.
:'''Think-Tank:''' We'll soon have all of our Hexanexus games upgraded. You can find one where you were playing it before.
:'''Think-Tank:''' This is a major update, so we may as well call this the Hexanexus 2.0.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Will anyone actually play it?
::'''Think-Tank:''' This new version is sure to be a hit.
::'''Think-Tank:''' Besides, we hope that you can keep playing as well.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Aren't you going to post a preview?
::'''Think-Tank:''' I'll think about it when we come to promotions.
:'''Think-Tank:''' Oh yeah, we'll place chests inside our new Hexanexus this time. Don't worry about it. Just play the Hexanexus and you'll get your chests &mdash; now that you're my good {{MC|f=Sister|m=Brother}}.
:'''Think-Tank:''' Goodbye then... Ah, I almost forget: Here you go. This is your gift as our latest Lifetime Hex Club Membership.
:'''Think-Tank:''' Play lots and play often. Hexanexus is the bestest!
