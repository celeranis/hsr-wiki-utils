:'''Leonard:''' These graffitis are usually referred to as {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"hacking callcards."}} They don't serve any actual function other than to distract. I wrote them in the codes to make it more realistic.
:'''Leonard:''' There are {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|3}} hacking callcards in each area. Try and locate all of them. As an added reward, collecting hacking callcards will increase your combat ability in the test.
