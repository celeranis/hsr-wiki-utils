;(Talk to Clara)
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 420 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 420 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh, it's you! I wanted to show you something... These little fellas.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about them?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That big one in the middle &mdash; is that...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 421.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes... he's Pascal.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotI 101.ogg}} '''Automaton Grizzly:''' Hello, hello, hello! Long time no see!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotJ 101.ogg}} '''Automaton A:''' Long time no see! Today, weather, great!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotK 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotK 101 f.ogg}} '''Automaton B:''' Thank, you! Long time, no see! (Trailblazer) friend, Clara friend!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They know who I am?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I don't know them...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 422.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes, that's what I was talking about... Something strange has happened.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 423.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog helped to format Pascal and integrate him into the base network, but after that...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 424 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 424 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...I discovered that whenever I mentioned your name to Mr. Svarog, these guys at the base would get really happy.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 425.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Look how excited they are about you! I've never met anyone for the first time that was so happy to see me...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 426.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I was wondering... is it because they share Pascal's emotions?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If so, that'd be fantastic.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 427.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yeah, it's like Pascal is always with us.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 428.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It's a nice feeling... just like the one I had before.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe it's some kind of technical fault?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 429.ogg}} '''Clara:''' That's what Mr. Svarog said. He said Pascal's emotional intelligence was like a virus that infected the entire base network at some point.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A virus...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 430 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 430 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Don't worry, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}. I don't think it's a bad thing, because...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 431.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...Mr. Svarog chose not to get rid of it. Isn't that the most convincing proof?
