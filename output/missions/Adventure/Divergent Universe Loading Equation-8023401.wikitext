;(Upon reaching the destination)
:'''Screwllum:''' Glad to meet you, {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mister}} (Trailblazer). Your presence brings a warmth akin to the spring sun, melting away the snow of falsehoods.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What brings you here, Screwllum?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And... you are?
::'''Screwllum:''' I'm Screwllum, Member #76 of the Genius Society and one of the developers of the Simulated Universe. Herta should have mentioned my name to you.
:'''Screwllum:''' Logic: I'd like to personally invite you to a thought experiment.
:'''Screwllum:''' Utilizing the Simulated Universe's underlying logic and the Planet Screwllum technology, I have created the Divergent Universe as a branch project for independent research regarding the Simulated Universe.
:'''Screwllum:''' Now, please come with me. Since the space station is Herta's personal asset, I have arranged the test site for the Divergent Universe elsewhere, utilizing some of my "Cosmic VIP" privileges.
:'''Screwllum:''' Welcome to Penacony, the Planet of Festivities. I hope you find it enjoyable.

;(Talk to Screwllum)
:'''Screwllum:''' We're here. The scenery in the Land of the Dreams is confusingly dazzling, and I have a friend from the Intelligentsia Guild who has quite some scathing words for it.
::'''Screwllum:''' I once invited him to bring fresh perspectives to the research conducted by the geniuses as a representative of the Intelligentsia Guild. Conclusion: He declined.
::'''Screwllum:''' During our discussion, that gentleman offered a beautiful analogy: Aeons and mortals are like the two ends of a functional equation. By solving the unknowns at one end, we can discover the answer at the other.
::'''Screwllum:''' The records of the Aeons are scarce, while the stories of mortals are abundant. He believes that rather than seeking the Aeons, following the traces left by ordinary people on the Paths is a better way to seek the truth.
::'''Screwllum:''' While that gentleman's suggestion may sound harsh, it is not without merit.
::'''Screwllum:''' Naturally, Herta expressed an opposing view. However, that potential equation of gods and mortals, as if imbued with life, expanded infinitely like petals within my circuits of inspiration.
::'''Screwllum:''' By tracking the fluctuations and mutual interferences of the extrapolated Path Energy, we will be able to construct the various possibilities and trends of change of creation.
::'''Screwllum:''' With these equations as the foundation, many seemingly chaotic phenomena will be described relatively simplistically in the Divergent Universe, and their underlying connections revealed.
::'''Screwllum:''' I eagerly await what new insights you will bring to this thought experiment. Please follow me, my friend.
:'''Screwllum:''' I eagerly await what new insights you will bring to this thought experiment. Please follow me, my friend.

;(Talk to Screwllum)
:'''Screwllum:''' If possible, I hope you will introduce more variables to the Divergent Universe, as a request from your friend.
;(Unused &mdash; EnterDistrict_G250)
::'''Screwllum:''' How did it feel, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Felt like I became someone else...
:::'''Screwllum:''' The Aeons bestow their blessings upon the world, while mortals ascend various Paths. Through the extrapolation of equations, these web-like trajectories will converge at specific points to generate a singular result &mdash; a materialized Pathstrider.
:::'''Screwllum:''' I have divided your consciousness into two parts: One as the Ego, traversing the Path and progressing towards distinct nodes in the algorithm. The second as the Other, becoming an observer that floats on a higher level.
:::'''Screwllum:''' This approach ensures that your consciousness remains undisturbed by my "equations" while maximizing your objectivity for complete extrapolations.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} About your new project...
:::'''Screwllum:''' Aeons and mortals... Paths constrain these two ends of the equal sign and shackle them both without bias. Logic: When analyzed from this perspective, they indeed both hold equal value. However, if asked which one holds the key to solving the puzzle...
:::'''Screwllum:''' Answer: I don't know, and I don't need to provide a conclusion.
:::'''Screwllum:''' I don't dare to hope of finding the answer within the Divergent Universe. After all, truth has always been reticent.
:::'''Screwllum:''' Nonetheless, I still possess an attitude similar to the organic beings' concept of "hope" for its future, as I have sensed remarkable entities within it.
:::'''Screwllum:''' If possible, I hope you will introduce more variables to the Divergent Universe, as a request from your friend.

:'''Screwllum:''' Your identity has been registered in the system. Please feel free to log into the Divergent Universe at any future time for testing purposes.
::'''Screwllum:''' This experiment will last for a considerable duration, and I apologize for not being able to remain by your side. However, please be assured that I will be monitoring your progress constantly.
::'''Screwllum:''' Compensation for your participation in the research will be provided regularly, equivalent to the rate of a class-A research assistant. Of course, it pales in comparison to the immense assistance you provide.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you for your generosity, boss!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm ready for more tests!
::'''Screwllum:''' As a gesture of goodwill, I should prepare something for my "partner" in return.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gift him a cuckoo clock.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gift him a birthday lotus flower.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Gift him a Casket of Inaccuracy.
::'''Screwllum:''' Thank you for your suggestion. I will take it into account.
::'''Screwllum:''' However, regarding the public database of the Candelagraphos, that gentleman was mistaken about one thing: I had come into those documents much earlier than he presumed.
::'''Screwllum:''' At that time, the aftermath of the Second Emperor's War had not yet settled, and the universe seethed with hatred against inorganic beings.
::'''Screwllum:''' Thus, I discovered those records and used them as samples for my quantitative analyses. By extrapolating human behavior, I managed to persuade both factions to lay down their weapons.
::'''Screwllum:''' I must admit that, at the time, those countless stories to me were mere numbers constituting "organic beings," similar to the 0s and 1s in our programs.
::'''Screwllum:''' However, the true weight and significance behind those names can only be comprehended when experienced firsthand.
::'''Screwllum:''' Within the symphony of the Aeons, numerous notes still play uninterrupted, hymns exclusively for mortals.
::'''Screwllum:''' The realization that we, who are churning along in our lives, are also integral parts of this extensive hymn, makes even my "heart" pound with unstoppable impulses.
