:{{DIcon|?}} Janus' Steed
:There is no doubt about it. The giant wooden prop before you is one you recognize from an old story. Its head raised high in the sky and room in its stomach for several people &mdash; it has all the familiar characteristics you expect.
:You survey the surrounding area to make sure no one is watching. Well, why not use this opportunity to test your theory?

:::When in an unfamiliar environment, it is always best to keep calm. You decide to take no action and see how things unfold.
:::You have no idea how long you've been bumping around in the dark. But, just as you feel like you can't hold the contents of your stomach back any longer, the wooden horse comes suddenly crashing to the ground, followed by the sound of soldiers in neat formation.
:::'''Imposing Voice:''' ...Leave it there for now. Let's go. There's more where that came from.
:::After confirming that all sound outside has disappeared, you use all your strength to burst through the wooden trap door and return to the outside world.
:::Then... You find yourself face-to-face with a powerful-looking man in Kremnos guard uniform.
:::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' What city do you fight for, soldier!? Why are you here!?
:::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' Explain yourself! If I sense a hint of hesitation, the long spear of Nikador will pierce your chest!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am from Castrum Kremnos!
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' Hahaha, praise Talanton! Your teachings guide my path, and your fair orders always yield reward.
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' &mdash; The Mad King's followers, you're the one I seek! You had no idea, did you? I am not from Castrum Kremnos at all!
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Oh?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Another twist?
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well played!
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' I have been undercover in the city for a number of days. I came to seek out information on the Mad King and send a few unlucky fools to meet Thanatos along the way. Though, I had no idea that the routes around here would be as maddening as the Mad King's mind itself. I've made no progress this whole time.
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' Fortunately, you delivered yourself to me on a platter. I shall use your blood as the first weight placed onto the scales!
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait! I was lying!
:::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' Trying to excuse yourself will only make your situation worse. Although, praise Talanton, I just had a new idea.
:::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' The life of a mere soldier is expendable in a battle like this. It is those of the power-wielding generals that can really tip the scales.
:::::Please stay calm. I can be your guide!
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please stay calm. I can be your guide!
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' A wise decision. The life of a mere soldier is expendable in a battle like this. It is those of the power-wielding generals that can really tip the scales.
::::'''Kremnos Guard (?):''' Tell me. What is the highest-ranking general of Castrum Kremnos like?

:A suit of armor that is covered in blood stains. It is clear to see that its owner experienced a long and brutal struggle. However, you recognize the insignia in the center of the helmet of a set of scales and recall the soldier that remained true to their faith.
:The sacrifices to Nikador continue. The mad Titan and the insane city are far from done.
:...May Talanton reward him with a gift fitting of his sacrifice. May his soul rest in peace.

:{{DIcon|?}} Investigate
:You notice that the armor shows signs of being burnt, as well as an insignia of a set of scales carved into the center of the helmet. The soldier who remained true to his faith may have attempted to start a fire here, only to end up being engulfed in the flames himself.
:...May Talanton reward him with a gift fitting of his sacrifice. May his soul rest in peace.

:{{DIcon|?}} Investigate
:The damaged suit of armor has been carelessly cast aside, covered in sword slashes. However, you recognize the insignia in the center of the helmet of a set of scales and recall the soldier who remained true to his faith.
:You have no idea what it was that happened to him, but the ending he met is clear to see. Perhaps he happened to bump into a troupe of wandering guards or a merciless Titankin... Whatever it may have been, Castrum Kremnos will tolerate no outcome but victory.
:...May Talanton reward him with a gift fitting of his sacrifice. May his soul rest in peace.

:{{DIcon|?}} Investigate
:A brand-new set of armor has been carefully stored in a box by the path. It seems that its owner no longer had any business in Castrum Kremnos. However, you recognize the insignia in the center of the helmet of a set of scales and recall the soldier who remained true to their faith.
:You firmly believe that the Eternal City will take in anyone willing to live under the light of Kephale, even those from cities of other faiths... Even those with blood on their hands.
:...In your heart, you pray that he arrives safely.
