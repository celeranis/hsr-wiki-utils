{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|The incident seems to have come to an end for now, but the matter with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is far from over. That genius chief alchemist in the Alchemy Commission is still looking into the Draught of Draconic Surge's pharmacology for you, but has delivered no findings so far. Better to leave the Artisanship Commission for now and wait for further contact in town.}}

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You've got that right.
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 102.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' Many who undertake the far-reaching journey to the Xianzhou are weighed down by a heavy heart and exhaustion... but your steps are bold and steady - a stride worthy of a Nameless.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can tell just by listening?
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 103.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' A persons's footfall reveals a lot about their strength and emotions &mdash; much like how a person's breath may serve as an indication of their overall health.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your ears are really sharp!
::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 104.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' I wouldn't be envious. This is not an innate ability &mdash; merely compensation for my visual impairment. Ultimately, nothing I hear or smell can match the vividness of the colors that you perceive.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 105.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' Let's get down to business... I analyzed the prescription you procured: The Draught of Draconic Surge. Now that I have a preliminary conclusion, it needs to be delivered to the Seat of Divine Foresight.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is the conclusion?
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 106.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' The conclusion... Put simply, I don't believe that the Draught of Draconic Surge holds the cure to the mara. Even in the foreseeable future, there will likely not be any such cure.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 107.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' I've compiled the details into a written analysis. If you're interested, feel free to take a look.
:{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 108.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' This is a copy of "Pharmacological Studies on the Draught of Draconic Surge." If the chief counselor wants to see it urgently, I'll have to ask you to deliver it for me.

::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 qingzu 104.ogg}} '''Qingzu:''' I've heard that the chief alchemist is visually impaired &mdash; she rarely leaves the Alchemy Commission delve. She has a vast knowledge and expertise &mdash; no wonder she was able to analyze the pharmacology so quickly.

:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childH 103.ogg}} '''Hateful Kid:''' The Luofu Trio is made up of two &mdash; uh... th&mdash;three super awesome kids that everyone's afraid of! Even the Realm-Keeping Commission!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll call the Realm-Keeping Commission over then.

::::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childH 108.ogg}} '''Hateful Kid:''' Number four, the boss never cries. Sure, his dad might yell at him sometimes, and the lyceum abecedaries like to make him stand in the hallway, but those are tears of strength &mdash; not weakness!

:::::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childG 109.ogg}} '''Mean Kid:''' Eat dirt! There are only two packs &mdash; just enough for me and the boss. Why would you get any?
:::::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childH 111.ogg}} '''Hateful Kid:''' You always steal my snacks when the boss isn't here. Now that he's arrived in Exalting Sanctum, it's payback time.
:::::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childF 112.ogg}} '''Arrogant Kid:''' Quit it, you two. Both packs are mine, that way there's nothing for you to fight over.
:::::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 childG 110.ogg}} '''Mean Kid:''' You can't just take both packs for yourself! Isn't the Luofu Trio supposed to share everything evenly?

:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 172.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' Borisin, known for their ferocity among the Denizens of Abundance, are similar to the foxians of the Yaoqing genetically... But the foxians are not abominations &mdash; they're Xianzhou people.
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 173.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' From there, we can say that the difference between an abomination and a Xianzhou person is not one of taxonomy, but one of culture.
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 174.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' If an abomination aligns with the Xianzhou, then they are a Xianzhou person. If a Xianzhou person aligns with the abominations, they become an abomination themselves. It is that simple.
:::{{A|VO side2 ywmc2 danshu 175.ogg}} '''Dan Shu:''' Abominations embrace their nature &mdash; they change and modify their flesh without care, for the sake of attaining power and strength. However, to the Xianzhou people, these methods are completely taboo.
