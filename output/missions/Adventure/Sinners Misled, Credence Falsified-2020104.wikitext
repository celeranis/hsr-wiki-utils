===Check Dan Shu's message{{subst:void|<!--202010401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Artisanship Commission|The incident seems to have come to an end for now, but the matter with the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus is far from over. That genius chief alchemist in the Alchemy Commission is still looking into the Draught of Draconic Surge's pharmacology for you, but has delivered no findings so far. Better to leave the Artisanship Commission for now and wait for further contact in town.}}
