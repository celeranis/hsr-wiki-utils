::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' You're here. The materials that need to be prepped today are the {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Eyes of Lightning}} and {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Metal}} &mdash; sounds intense. Shall we begin?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Let's talk about this deal.
::'''Sampo:''' You're curious about the story behind this product? Let me regale you, then. Remember my friends from beyond the sky? Among them was a Knight of Beauty...
::'''Sampo:''' He told me a story about conquering the lightning. Said it was a scientist who wanted to verify that the sources of lightning and static electricity are the same, and chose a stormy day to fly a kite.
::'''Sampo:''' That kite was tied to a metal thread, and with a massive "bang," he successfully stored a flash of lightning from the sky in a glass bottle.
::'''Sampo:''' But, he was also struck half-dead by the lightning itself. Here's where it gets interesting! That elegant knight yelled out &mdash; "In this very moment, you have embraced the divine Beauty!"
::'''Sampo:''' Who the heck was that? If he were any more emotional, he'd probably go down personally and embrace Idrila!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I have to go.
::'''Sampo:''' Take care, friend. Come back tomorrow!
