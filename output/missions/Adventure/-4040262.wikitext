:'''Little Ghost:''' O-hoho! You found me!
:'''Little Ghost:''' Let me think, what favor can I give you...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you want to do me a favor?
::'''Little Ghost:''' Huh, why so paranoid? I'm just trying to do you a favor here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You won't keep waiting for me here, will you?
::'''Little Ghost:''' Do you think I'm just sitting here wishing for the stars and moon, waiting for somebody to come and visit?
::'''Little Ghost:''' ...Well, it's true.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should run. Aren't you afraid of the strongest legal department catching you?
::'''Little Ghost:''' The strongest legal department... are you talking about the Ten-Lords Commission?
::'''Little Ghost:''' ...Actually, they are just a little bit scary. They won't arrest me for my "carefully-designed appearance," will they?
<pre>{
	"$type": "RPG.GameCore.TalkFigure",
	"ImagePath": "SpriteOutput/Mission/TalkItem/SubMission_408206.png"
}</pre>
:'''Little Ghost:''' Anyway... Here's something for you. It might be a bit stinky, but it's also very useful.
:'''Little Ghost:''' What a serendipitous meeting. You and I were destined to meet. Here's a little something for you. You're welcome.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thank you. I'll take good care of it.
:<pre>{
	"$type": "RPG.GameCore.TalkFigure",
	"Show": false,
	"ImagePath": "SpriteOutput/Mission/TalkItem/SubMission_408206.png"
}</pre>
::'''Little Ghost:''' That's great. Everyone loves little surprises like this.
::'''Little Ghost:''' ...No, actually based on personal experience, there are some who don't.
::'''Little Ghost:''' May I ask: Why is it that you dislike my method of entrance?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Someone else has already done it!
:<pre>{
	"$type": "RPG.GameCore.TalkFigure",
	"Show": false,
	"ImagePath": "SpriteOutput/Mission/TalkItem/SubMission_408206.png"
}</pre>
::'''Little Ghost:''' Really...? I might be lacking for creativity then, but why can't I use the same entrance as someone else for myself, too?
::'''Little Ghost:''' I'm just a tiny heliobus, and that's all I want. May I ask, why do you hate this entrance?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Because it's completely devoid of creativity!
::'''Little Ghost:''' Um, does repeating another person's behavior get unfairly tagged as being "uncreative"? Humans sure are an interesting species.
::'''Little Ghost:''' But can intelligent creatures actually visualize something that they haven't even seen before?
::'''Little Ghost:''' If my entrance is not a sudden appearance, but instead spiral off into the sky with sparks like a firework &mdash; is that okay? It's not that simple, is it?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} This is plagiarizing another person's stage entrance.
::'''Little Ghost:''' So, plagiarism is it...? I've heard that in human societies, you can be held legally liable if you do the exact same thing that someone else has done before. Is human law really this strict?
::'''Little Ghost:''' Will a human be arrested by a Judge merely for saying something that someone else said? Human society, how suffocating!
::'''Little Ghost:''' "sigh" It's so much better being a free and roaming heliobus.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} It's totally awkward and not serious at all!
::'''Little Ghost:''' I see, it's the timing of my entrance that isn't serious enough, and feels awkward. Sorry for that, human.
::'''Little Ghost:''' I'll pick a time in the future when it's less serious to suddenly pop out, then. Unless you're one of those "always serious" types.
::'''Little Ghost:''' You should learn how to be happy, human.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Whatever &mdash; just don't make an appearance like that next time!
::'''Little Ghost:''' If someone else didn't like it, you wouldn't just stop breathing, would you?
::'''Little Ghost:''' If you tell storytellers not to tell any stories that someone else has told before, they would feel hurt &mdash; or start to doubt themselves.
::'''Little Ghost:''' ...Pity you're only asking a heliobus.
::'''Little Ghost:''' I'm Memey the Imp, and I'm not gonna stop doing something just because a human doesn't like it. Teehee!
::'''Little Ghost:''' You enjoy that gift, okay. Bye!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Pull it out a little more)

::For the sake of this wee little incense burner &mdash; and also to alleviate my intrusive thoughts &mdash; we should push it in a little more.

:::'''Little Ghost:''' Here's something for you. It might be a little stinky, but it's also very useful. Take it.
:::'''Little Ghost:''' ...Well, I'm trying to think of other ways to reward you. Got any good ideas?
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Use the incense burner to form a circle...
::::'''Little Ghost:''' ...and leave a gap? Genius!
::::'''Little Ghost:''' But it's getting a bit repetitive now. Let me have a think.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Leave a big boulder in an obvious place...
::::'''Little Ghost:''' ...and when you move the boulder, I APPEAR! Brilliant!
::::'''Little Ghost:''' But something tells me most people won't move the boulder, and I'll just be left hiding there in pitch blackness.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Float some balloons with targets on them high up into the sky...
::::'''Little Ghost:''' ...and when you shoot down all the balloons, I pop out?
::::'''Little Ghost:''' What if you don't have a bow and arrow? I don't have the cash for that...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...What if you just give me the reward straight?
::::'''Little Ghost:''' I have no complaints... But isn't a sense of ceremony something on which you humans place great importance?
::::'''Little Ghost:''' Celebrating the day you were born, the day you met, and the day you died... Isn't it all just so tedious?
::::'''Little Ghost:''' So you ask, can I JUST give you the reward? No. Complete the challenge and I'll give you the reward: THAT is the rule.
::::'''Little Ghost:''' Whatever, I'm going to have another think.
