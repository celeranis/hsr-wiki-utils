:{{DIcon|?}} Sleep

:A philosopher once said, "You need to stay awake all day to sleep all night." A poet once wrote, "Lying down late after the lamp is out, sleeping soundly amid the sound of rain."
:These two lines have nothing to do with what's coming next... Why are we talking about this?
:Anyway, after a day's hard work, there's no greater relief than going back to your room for a good sleep. Throwing yourself onto your bed with no alarm clock and no worries about oversleeping &mdash; ah, how happy it is.
:The warm, cozy bed in front of you beckons like an obvious trap. Perhaps you should follow your heart, lie down, and get a good sleep.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Lie in bed)
::Soft mattress, warm quilt. As soon as your head hits the cloud-like pillow, sleepiness comes in waves.
::Turn off the light and have a good sleep.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Turn off the light)

:::It's as if the instincts lurking in your mammalian genes awakened in the darkness. This is your "lair" &mdash; warm, dark, and safe, where no one can harm you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't. I'm terrified of the dark.

::So, how long are you going to sleep?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} A little while.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' What a nice sleep~ Got enough strength to fool around again!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sleep as long as I can.
::;(Screen fades to black)
:::You look exhausted. Please have a good rest. No one will disturb you.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm so sleepy! I'm going to sleep until the heat death of the universe!

:::No problem. You will sleep until the heat death of the universe as desired.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Goodnight, Astral Express.

:{{DIcon|Exit}} It's not the time to sleep now!
::Oh, well. But remember not to exhaust yourself. Your health is the prerequisite for trailblazing.
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Hmm? Where the heck am I? Is it still the Astral Express?
:{{Rubi|Medical study shows|Note: There is no such study}} that sleeping too long can lead to sleepwalking.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Would I sleepwalk that far?
::That's why you deserve the title of Trailblazer!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't make up medical knowledge. It's misleading.
::Sorry, it was a mistake that all narrators make.
:In short, please note you may find yourself in strange places after waking up if you are asleep so long~
