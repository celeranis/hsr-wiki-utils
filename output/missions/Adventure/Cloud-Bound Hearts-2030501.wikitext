:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How can I help you?
::'''Family Secretary:''' Regarding the issue of Radiant Feldspar's ownership, there are some matters that require your attention.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Are you guys really giving it to me unconditionally?
::'''Family Secretary:''' Yes. According to the agreement between us and the Astral Express, the Radiant Feldspar will be left in your care.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But this obviously belongs to everyone...

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where should I go about hiring such a person?
:::'''Family Secretary:''' Please do not worry, I will be assisting you the entire way. I'll help organize the recruitment, and you just have to make the final call.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nothing better than doing it myself &mdash; I don't think hiring a first mate is necessary...

:'''Caldwick:''' Captain, it's an honor to see you again. I've recruited new crew members based on my own management guidelines.
:How are the results?
:'''Caldwick:''' The feedback from our guests is overflowing with praise!
:Looks like there are all sorts of people here...
:'''Caldwick:''' I value their initiative more than their appearance or uniform.
:'''Caldwick:''' With the freedom and trust given to the crew, their performance level has increased, and the guests on the airship have been showering us with compliments.
:'''Caldwick:''' Additionally, we've also gotten a glowing recommendation from a famous travel influencer! All these events prove the effectiveness of my management guidelines.
:'''Caldwick:''' With this successful endeavor in hand, I'd like to suggest a few improvements to be made to the airship &mdash; a couple of crew members have come forth with feedback on an issue they're facing in a certain area. I'll need your help to conduct a site visit with me.
:Caldwick takes you to the deck.
:'''Caldwick:''' This is the suggestion given by the crew: It's time to change the empennage and the name of the airship to denote the changes that have taken place since the airship's change of hands.
:'''Caldwick:''' I believe this change will be able to elevate our brand image. Can I get your opinion on this?
:Just use my name and face.
:'''Caldwick:''' I'm sorry. The airship's name will be used for commercial purposes. If we use your image and name directly, it poses too much of a risk. I'll have to reject that proposal, and beg your understanding.
:Do you have any good suggestions?
:'''Caldwick:''' The best design must be attractive to guests and emphasize your style.
:'''Caldwick:''' You're the captain. It's of utmost importance to consider your aesthetic preferences. Do you have a favorite person or thing to use as the mascot of the airship?
:...Pom-Pom, Conductor of the Astral Express.
:'''Caldwick:''' The Astral Express' conductor? It'll be a nice touch to paint a Pom-Pom lookalike on the airship's empennage.
:'''Caldwick:''' Then {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the airship's new name shall henceforth be the Trailblaze's Stern}}, emphasizing the importance of conductor Pom-Pom and highlighting your status as a Nameless.
:...Trashcan.
:'''Caldwick:''' Even though it's a trashcan, the more unconventional something appears in dreams, the more captivating it becomes.
:'''Caldwick:''' Then {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the airship's new name shall henceforth be the Tatalov}}. It is the legendary Garbage King, and it has a forward-looking feel with a post-modern aesthetic.
:...Clockie.
:'''Caldwick:''' Oh, by using a well-known image in Penacony. This will save a fortune in promotional costs.
:'''Caldwick:''' Then {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the airship's new name shall henceforth be the Soaring Clock Hand}} &mdash; only with an airship helmed by Clockie is worthy of its guests.
:'''Caldwick:''' Thank you for your support, captain. Please hold on for a moment...

:'''Caldwick:''' It's usually bustling here. Once you board the airship, you'll have to pass by here no matter where you're going.
:'''Caldwick:''' The crew suggests that we place a statue of your bust here. I think it's a great way for our team to show our respect and trust in your leadership. Additionally, it will strengthen our team's unity.
:'''Caldwick:''' We've had many new recruits, one among them having graduated from the Paperfold University. He has already tried printing your statue. I wonder if you're agreeable to having it be placed here?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bring it up!
::'''Caldwick:''' Just a moment.
::Don't put it up if it's not nice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't put it up if it's not nice.
:'''Caldwick:''' Please be rest assured. I've checked it. His aesthetics are good. He's able to replicate at least sixty percent of your appearance.
:'''Caldwick:''' No matter how many times I've seen it, I'm still taken aback. The statue looks refreshing, unrivaled by any captain in the industry...

:'''Pedro:''' I come from a family that has been flying for generations, and I've inherited a bunch of experience from my folks. I've made my rounds on the airship, and I feel that there is some room for improvement.
:'''Pedro:''' The first area for improvement: Crew member training. Of course, this is a legacy issue left behind by the previous captain. I'd like to ask for a favor of letting me be in charge of recruiting and managing the crew!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem.

:'''Pedro:''' Captain, we meet again. I've recruited some folks from my hometown. Please take a look!
:'''Pedro:''' I'm not tooting my own horn. You can ask around in the industry. Although they are from an offshoot of my family, I can guarantee that they are all veterans, packed with experience and integrity.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have much experience in flying, so don't trick me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Really?
:'''Pedro:''' Of course! Not to mention, we Pepeshi are natural repairmen. These folks that I'm bringing on board all hold official certificates to verify their abilities, issued by The Family themselves! They were verified by the Alfalfa Family as well.
:'''Pedro:''' Our unity and world-class professional skills are the key to guaranteeing a successful voyage. We are deeply honored to be under your employment. Captain, please allow us to serve you with everything we've got!
:'''Pedro:''' Instead of describing it, let me bring you to a place, and you'll know &mdash; my nephew told me about it, and I thought it'd be good to report it to you.
:Pedro takes you to the deck.
:'''Pedro:''' My nephew realized that the paint job on the empennage hasn't been changed, nor has the old name, Radiant Feldspar. Since you're its new master, isn't it time to change it?
:'''Pedro:''' What do you think?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Proudly use my image!
::'''Pedro:''' Ah, that's a big no-no. The empennage is filthy, and if an accident happens during flying, it'll be split open and ruin your image. That's bad luck!
::Do you have any good suggestions?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you have any good suggestions?
