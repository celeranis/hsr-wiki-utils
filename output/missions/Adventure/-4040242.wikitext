:'''Bailu:''' Hey, (Trailblazer)! You're awake!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is this place?
::'''Bailu:''' The Alchemy Commission. It sounds like you were scared unconscious in the Seat of Divine Foresight, so Qingzu contacted me to rush over to save you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The bomb blew me all the way here!?
::'''Bailu:''' Bomb? Oh, you meant the prank scare box? Qingzu explained most of the situation to me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did I get reborn?
::'''Bailu:''' Reborn? You're not one of us Vidyadhara! Why are you talking nonsense... Maybe you need more electrotherapy...
::'''Bailu:''' Hey, don't run away! I was only kidding. You want to talk about what happened just now?
:'''Bailu:''' So, what happened exactly? Why were you knocked out by a prank scare box?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Prank scare box? I don't know.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just what on earth happened?
:'''Bailu:''' Hm... Looks like you don't know either.
:'''Bailu:''' Oh, right! Qingzu left the note inside the box for me. Take a look. Maybe it will jog your memory?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He came to the Xianzhou!?
:'''Bailu:''' Is this someone you know? To pull off such an old-school prank... this person doesn't seem ordinary at all.
:'''Bailu:''' Oh, yes, almost forgot... Qingzu also asked me to give this to you. Her exact words are: "Thank you for your support of the Seat of Divine Foresight's work, and also for saving everyone on the Xianzhou Luofu."
:'''Bailu:''' So, keep it! By the way, if you still feel under the weather, come find me anytime.

::The Lunarescent Depths, the sacred and incorruptible holy waters of the Vidyadhara, remain calm and peaceful even today.
::It is said that the water of this ancient sea has special medicinal properties. Not only can it be used in the elixir crucibles to refining medicine, but it also serve as an antiknock agent that suppresses the shocks and popping during the quenching process &mdash; In theory, you can destroy the dangerous package here.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Destroy the dangerous parcel.
:::Are you serious!? That package contains a mini-neutron bomb!
:::Yes, the waters of Lunarescent Depths have flame-retardant and antiknocking properties &mdash; But this body of water is also the sacred water of life for the Vidyadhara people, the symbol of their ancient beliefs!
:::Do you have the heart to desecrate their beliefs with a weapon of mass destruction? Are you willing to break this peaceful tranquility?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I do!
::::You...
::::No, you can't. This is too immoral.
