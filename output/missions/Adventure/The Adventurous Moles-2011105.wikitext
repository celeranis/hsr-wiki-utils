;(Talk to Julian)
:'''Julian:''' I heard Hook say that she took you adventuring in Rivet Town just to find my marbles.
:'''Julian:''' Thank you very much, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}, but don't read too much into it. That's not enough for you to be the second-in-command of The Moles. You gotta get past me &mdash; and I ain't planning on giving up my position just yet!
:'''Julian:''' ...O&mdash;okay. Just give me my stuff.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Hand over Julian's things to him)
:'''Julian:''' Is all of this my stuff? Thank you, {{MC|m=mister|f=miss}}! These glass marbles I won... Are these also mine? "For Julian, in 50 years' time"?
:'''Julian:''' ...Ah, that's the key for the iron gates behind the business street. No one needs it anymore. Thank you so much!
:'''Julian:''' You've given me so much stuff, {{MC|m=mister|f=miss}}. I have to give you something too &mdash; well, how about this copy of ''The Adventurous Moles''?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Adventurous Moles?
:'''Julian:''' Oh? {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, do you know about ''The Adventurous Moles'' too?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I love it!
::'''Julian:''' I read ''The Adventurous Moles'' every night before going to bed. My dreams are full of fun adventures!
::'''Julian:''' Wait, you're not pretending to like it, are you... let me ask you, who are the three protagonists in the book?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I confess I haven't read it.
:::'''Julian:''' I knew it, you have to read ''The Adventurous Moles''. It is full of fun adventures.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} They are a trio that went to a wizarding school...
:::'''Julian:''' Hmm, interesting, but you're totally wrong! You should do better and read ''The Adventurous Moles''. It is full of fun adventures.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} March 7th, Dan Heng and me.
:::'''Julian:''' Hmph, you are such a cheeky grownup. You should do better and read ''The Adventurous Moles''.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I haven't read it.
::'''Julian:''' Then you have to read it. It's full of interesting adventures!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't say I like it.
::'''Julian:''' Stop pretending. You haven't actually read it at all, have you? Tell me who the three protagonists are in the book.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I confess I haven't read it.

:::'''Julian:''' Hmph, you are such a cheeky grownup. You should do better and read ''The Adventurous Moles''.
:'''Julian:''' There are all kinds of stories in ''The Adventurous Moles''... But this edition is a bit strange. It's only got the preface and the table of contents. Here, read the preface.

:'''Julian:''' The author said in the preface {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"If you follow the clues in the table of contents, you can find the corresponding locations, where you can collect the pages of the book."}}...
:'''Julian:''' It seems to be saying that this edition is meant to have book pages, but they are hidden somewhere, and we have to use the table of contents to find clues about those hidden pages.

:'''Julian:''' Look at the chapter "The Missing Miner's Lamp." It says: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"In the Great Mine of Boulder Town..."}} Is that where some of the missing pages are?
:'''Julian:''' I haven't found anything, and I'm not even sure whether it's really true. But {{MC|m=mister|f=miss}}, if you'd like to know more about ''The Adventurous Moles'', then I can tell you all about that.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is ''The Adventurous Moles'' about?
::'''Julian:''' ''The Adventurous Moles'' has all kinds of great adventures. The Moles would often go into primitive jungles, lost cities, and even outer space...
::{{DIcon|Return}} Is there a jungle in Belobog?
:::'''Julian:''' Do grownups have no imagination? The adventures can be fictional, you know.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Return}} Do you believe in the stuff written in the book?

::;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is so interesting about ''The Adventurous Moles''?
::'''Julian:''' All the protagonists in the story are children, but they often achieve things that adults cannot do. And when I read ''The Adventurous Moles'', I feel like I'm on an adventure, too.
::'''Julian:''' The author always calls the reader "the fourth little mole," so I am also a member of The Moles.
::{{DIcon|Return}} Adventure stories are indeed fun to read.
:::'''Julian:''' Oh, how I wish I could go on an epic adventure in a fantasy world of magic and swords, with my very own emergency food!

::{{DIcon|Return}} Is that how you guys got the name "The Moles"?

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Who's the lead in ''The Adventurous Moles''?
::'''Julian:''' Don't you even know the three little moles?

:{{DIcon|Exit}} Let me go and see.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} ...How were you scammed?
:::'''Chavez:''' The first time I met that guy, he asked if I wanted a "parallel universe printer."
:::'''Chavez:''' Well, I asked him how the printer works... and he immediately started rambling on a bunch of smorgasbord about science stuff. I was almost caught up in it.
:::'''Chavez:''' Terms like parallel universe, Aeons, and parity anomaly... Swindlers love to use these words related to the universe and Aeons to scam people!

:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did the printer work?
::::'''Chavez:''' Of course not, otherwise why do you think I would have joined the association?
:::'''Chavez:''' Ahem, sometime later, after the counterfeiting scam, I bumped into that same blue-haired guy again in an alley in the Commercial District.
:::'''Chavez:''' I should have had the Silvermane Guards arrest him, but I was so angry and I needed an explanation...
:::'''Chavez:''' Instead, he asked me with a straight face, "Were you staring at the printer?"
:::'''Chavez:''' He accused me of not reading the manual and wasting such a genius invention. He even offered to refund the full payment so that he could find another buyer for the parallel universe printer.
:::'''Chavez:''' He also said, "If the operator keeps staring at the printer, the parallel universe transmission can't happen. The only way to avoid interfering with the transmission process is to observe it with the help of an aether lens."
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...So you bought an aether lens?
:::'''Chavez:''' Doesn't that sound reasonable? So I was tricked again by his apparent sincerity...

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of legal issues do you help them with?
::'''Furdo:''' Legal issues? You think too highly of the people of Belobog. What they come to me for has nothing to do with the law. It's all complaints about daily life.

:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What creatures are there in Belobog?
::'''Lila:''' Cats and dogs. There are wolves and birds in the wild... That's about it. You'll have to check out the museum's specimens to see what other kinds of animals there were in the past.
::'''Lila:''' I heard that hundreds of years ago, Belobog had domesticated bears, and direwolves roamed the wild. They're no longer around though.
::'''Lila:''' But I believe there are other animals out there that survived the Eternal Freeze. I just have no way to prove it. Now, I have no choice but to study humans...
::'''Lila:''' Did you know that humans in Belobog have at least three different origins? But you don't seem to belong to any one of them. That's why I was so surprised back then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You must be mistaken.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're right, I'm an alien.
::'''Lila:''' Haha, I must've been researching too much... Ever since I got my hands on that book, my head's been in the clouds.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What book?
:::'''Lila:''' This ''Underground Encyclopedia of Zoology'' was apparently brought back from the underground by a Silvermane Guard. It talks about a lot of strange creatures.
:::'''Lila:''' Ever since I finished the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how these animals must look like.
:::'''Lila:''' I really want to know more about these crystalline lizards, geomarrow olms, funeral worms... I want to know what they eat, how they reproduce... everything.

::'''Lila:''' I've been outside the city a few times for journalism, but there wasn't enough spare time to do ecological research then.
::'''Lila:''' But recently, I met a benefactor who is willing to finance my expedition as long as his requirements are met. He's even willing to take care of the expedition permits and formalities as well.

;(Talk to Manya)
:'''Manya:''' I just said I'm on break... Fine, if you insist.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of work do you do exactly?
::'''Manya:''' Excellent question! My job involves a little bit of everything, but vital to keeping things running smoothly in Belobog! You could say I'm the unsung hero of the city.
::'''Manya:''' I'm responsible for grassroots affairs in the Administrative District, listening to basic requests from people, and solving day-to-day issues.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} In that case, can you hear out my request?
::'''Manya:''' Of course! But you will need to reserve a slot. My work hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. I handle administrative and civil affairs during these times.
::'''Manya:''' I'm currently on break. As a public official, separating professional and private time is of basic importance.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} How do I make an official appointment?
::'''Manya:''' Please fill out a form at counter 236 on the second floor of Qlipoth Fort. Then have a staff member stamp it at window 35 on the third floor.
::'''Manya:''' After stamping, please head to window 155 on the first floor and wait in line for the proof of appointment. The formal processing usually takes one month after the appointment has been made.
::'''Manya:''' To inquire about the specific processes, please consult the window staff when making the appointment.

::'''Manya:''' What would make you think that? But I don't blame you. Many have the same misunderstanding, thinking this is just a job where you can kick your feet up.
::'''Manya:''' A job where I just "Clock in, drink tea, read the newspaper, chit-chat with colleagues, and stare at the time, waiting to get off." But that's all nonsense.
::'''Manya:''' Please lose these false impressions of grassroots public officials. Our days are busy ones indeed.

::'''Nika:''' Can I ask you a question, about literature?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course.
:::'''Nika:''' Just one of those general questions. I'd like to hear your take on it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Literature?
:::'''Nika:''' Just one of those general questions. I'd like to hear your take on it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Pretend you didn't notice her)
:::'''Nika:''' Wait a minute! It won't take long.
::'''Nika:''' I'll get straight to it. How would you rate these two books, ''Snow Plains'' and ''The Three Trebles''?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I haven't read either.
:::'''Nika:''' What? That's a pity. These are must-reads on the list of "Books You Should Read in Belobog."
:::'''Nika:''' Well, don't mind me... I guess I can't expect everyone to be as educated...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Make up a generic literary critique)
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Powerful, stylish, and full of unexpected twists and turns, these two books demonstrated with their refined language the strengths of both authors.
:::'''(Trailblazer):''' Their attempt to question and explore the spiritual side of mankind is commendable but unfortunately falls short compared with some of the greatest works of literature.
:::'''Nika:''' Amazing! Words of wisdom from a true master.
::'''Nika:''' Let me introduce myself. I am Nika with the ''Crystal Daily''. Sorry to bother you but we are collecting petitions from readers to lift the ban on the ''Tale of the Winterlands''.
::'''Nika:''' It would be wonderful if you could sign here. Of course, feel free to raise any concerns...
::'''Nika:''' Ah yes, as a gesture of goodwill, I'll give you ''The Seven Wonders of Belobog'' as a gift!
