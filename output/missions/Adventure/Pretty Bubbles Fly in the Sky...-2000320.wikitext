===Ask Herta about the mysterious bubbles in the Space Station{{subst:void|<!--200032002-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Master Control Zone|update|You saw many strange bubbles in the space station. They gave you a notification about "no clearance" when you approached them. In that case, you can go ask the person who theoretically has the highest clearance and see what she has to say.}}

;(Talk to Herta)
:{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 132.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Still haven't made up your mind? Fine. Since I'm interested in you, I'll answer any questions you have.
::{{DIcon|?}} There are strange bubbles at the space station...
:::'''Herta:''' Oh, this is a top secret. Outsiders can never know that I own this thing. You must sign a non-disclosure agreement first.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's inside?
::::'''Herta:''' I won't tell you a thing before you sign the agreement.
::::You take the paper and pen from Herta and leave your signature. The paper is made from a bizarre material, and the ink dries up the moment it touches the paper. When you move the tip of the pen away, your heart suddenly flutters.
::::'''Herta:''' Please bear in mind that this agreement is more than a legally binding contract. You must also abide by the law of the Imaginary, which is above the social and natural laws. Not even the IPC can override it.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why didn't you say that before I signed the agreement?
:::::'''Herta:''' Would you have refused to sign if I'd told you that? You seem like the kind who doesn't think much about consequences. You will make a decision regardless of its price.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Law of the Imaginary?
:::::'''Herta:''' It is the law of the universe and the world &mdash; the only unbreakable law.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I sign another agreement to nullify this non-disclosure agreement?
:::::'''Herta:''' Don't worry. If I want to swindle you, you'll never see it coming.
::::'''Herta:''' Now that you have signed the agreement, you can do anything you like with my Memory Bubbles. Just make sure you are out of the sight of entities from the Garden of Recollection. In fact, I don't think there will be any trouble even if they catch you...
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Memory Bubble?
:::::'''Herta:''' The Garden of Recollection has ways to steal the memories of others. To preserve memories, they created a Sentiention membrane to keep the memories wrapped up in it like a bubble, making it easy to carry memories around.
:::::'''Herta:''' They have an even more advanced technology called Light Cones. With that, they can capture more than just memories... It's a shame that I can never master the Light Cone technology without the Blessing of the Aeon Fuli.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} The Garden of Recollection?
:::::'''Herta:''' It is a faction that worships the Aeon Fuli. In their opinion, the world is defined by everyone's perception, and memories are the proof of the world's existence. They are willing to forgo their physical bodies for that purpose.
:::::'''Herta:''' If you ask me, the Garden of Recollection, the Architects, The Family, and the Antimatter Legion are all idiots. They obsessively worship their Aeons.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Who are the Memokeepers?
:::::'''Herta:''' They are members of the Garden of Recollection who travel between worlds to collect precious memories. You will run into them sooner or later. I bet the memory of a Astral Express passenger is highly sought after by them.
:::::'''Herta:''' You could get lucky if you meet civilized Memokeepers, since they might use an amazing memory to exchange with yours. However, watch out for the Memosnatchers, the radicals in the Garden of Recollection. They won't give you a heads-up before stealing your memory.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I touch the bubble now?
:::::'''Herta:''' Sure~ Just touch it with your forehead. Remember to close your eyes, or your head will start spinning.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine. I'll sign it.
::::'''Herta:''' Great...

::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Stellarons...
:::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 141.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Stellarons, huh? Ask away, I'm listening.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What exactly is a Stellaron?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 142.ogg}} '''Herta:''' According to my research, it's a type of lifeform with a special property that tethers it to a certain Path or Aeon's power.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 143.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Wherever it's located, it responds to that world's desires to advance its civilization. But, this comes at the cost of some form of disaster. The mechanism behind it is likely related to Nanook the Destruction.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you know about the Stellaron Hunters?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 144.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Oh, that weird bunch. I'm satisfied with just one Stellaron, but they've scoured the universe, obtained several, and still aren't satisfied. I don't know what their true intentions are.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 145.ogg}} '''Herta:''' {{Rubi|Screwllum|Genius Society #76}} went up against the Stellaron Hunters before. I heard there was a member whose hacking skills were on par with Screwllum.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 146.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Being on the same level as Screwllum &mdash; who's probably the best in the universe &mdash; is nothing short of spectacular. It's beyond my abilities, computers are not my forte.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why am I able to host the Stellaron?

::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 149.ogg}} '''Herta:''' You mean how it looks? Like a train. Well...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 150.ogg}} '''Herta:''' I was very interested in the Express for a while, and wrote a lot of papers, but forgot where I left them. Now I can't remember anything about it.

::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 151.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Uh-huh.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What's your relationship with them?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 152.ogg}} '''Herta:''' We've been business partners for a long time.

::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the decision...
:::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 154.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Uh, what decision? You're gonna have to be more specific.
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I return to the space station?
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 155.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Of course, I'll still be here waiting for you, eh... and the space station will be waiting for you. Returning... it's not impossible.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 156.ogg}} '''Herta:''' If you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask Asta. If she's fine with it, I have no complaints.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 157.ogg}} '''Herta:''' No, hold on &mdash; you have a Stellaron within you. I think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. It might be dangerous if you stay for too long...
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} So I should board the Express?
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 158.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 159.ogg}} '''Herta:''' First of all, you have somewhere to live. And you'd be under their protection. Also, it'll be a long trip, so you'll have more opportunities to find a way to save yourself from the Stellaron. Lastly, if the Stellaron really explodes, you won't harm too many people around you.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} You're the master of the space station?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 134.ogg}} '''Herta:''' On paper, yes. But I don't really care about this place. I built it, put some stuff in, left some people here, and let them just manage themselves.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 135.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Asta's the lead researcher of the space station, so for all intents and purposes, she's the master. I reject the concept of ownership because I don't want the responsibilities that come with it.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} You really are a terrible person.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 136.ogg}} '''Herta:''' It doesn't matter. Who cares if others don't like me? I know I don't care. As long as I have my own value, I can do whatever I want.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 137.ogg}} '''Herta:''' While you may have good character, do you have any value? Don't take that the wrong way, I'm genuinely asking you. You might have some value, I just don't know about it.

::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 138.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Human, female, young, beautiful, attractive.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 139.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Not much different from what you're seeing now. I modeled it after how I looked, back when I was a kid. It might not be identical, but I'd say maybe 70, 80 percent there?

::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 155.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Of course, I'll still be here waiting for you, eh... and the space station will be waiting for you. Returning... it's not impossible.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 156.ogg}} '''Herta:''' If you wanna be a researcher here, you can just ask Asta. If she's fine with it, I have no complaints.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 157.ogg}} '''Herta:''' No, hold on &mdash; you have a Stellaron within you. I think it's better if you left and came back occasionally. It might be dangerous if you stay for too long...
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} So I should board the Express?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 158.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Well, from an objective standpoint, that's the most rational place for you to be.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 159.ogg}} '''Herta:''' First of all, you have somewhere to live. And you'd be under their protection. Also, it'll be a long trip, so you'll have more opportunities to find a way to save yourself from the Stellaron. Lastly, if the Stellaron really explodes, you won't harm too many people around you.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Do I have any other choice?
::::{{A|VO chapter0 6 herta 160.ogg}} '''Herta:''' Oh, how should I know! It's up to you, you have so many options to choose from. Maybe jump out a hatch, or hop into the Fragmentum and see if any monsters start worshiping you?
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Return}} I still have some questions...
:::::{{DIcon|?}} There are strange bubbles at the space station...
::::::'''Herta:''' Oh, this is a top secret. Outsiders can never know that I own this thing. You must sign a non-disclosure agreement first.
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's inside?
:::::::'''Herta:''' I won't tell you a thing before you sign the agreement.
:::::::You take the paper and pen from Herta and leave your signature. The paper is made from a bizarre material, and the ink dries up the moment it touches the paper. When you move the tip of the pen away, your heart suddenly flutters.
:::::::'''Herta:''' Please bear in mind that this agreement is more than a legally binding contract. You must also abide by the law of the Imaginary, which is above the social and natural laws. Not even the IPC can override it.
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why didn't you say that before I signed the agreement?
::::::::'''Herta:''' Would you have refused to sign if I'd told you that? You seem like the kind who doesn't think much about consequences. You will make a decision regardless of its price.
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Law of the Imaginary?
::::::::'''Herta:''' It is the law of the universe and the world &mdash; the only unbreakable law.
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I sign another agreement to nullify this non-disclosure agreement?
::::::::'''Herta:''' Don't worry. If I want to swindle you, you'll never see it coming.
:::::::'''Herta:''' Now that you have signed the agreement, you can do anything you like with my Memory Bubbles. Just make sure you are out of the sight of entities from the Garden of Recollection. In fact, I don't think there will be any trouble even if they catch you...
:::::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Memory Bubble?
::::::::'''Herta:''' The Garden of Recollection has ways to steal the memories of others. To preserve memories, they created a Sentiention membrane to keep the memories wrapped up in it like a bubble, making it easy to carry memories around.
::::::::'''Herta:''' They have an even more advanced technology called Light Cones. With that, they can capture more than just memories... It's a shame that I can never master the Light Cone technology without the Blessing of the Aeon Fuli.
:::::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::::{{DIcon|Talk}} The Garden of Recollection?
::::::::'''Herta:''' It is a faction that worships the Aeon Fuli. In their opinion, the world is defined by everyone's perception, and memories are the proof of the world's existence. They are willing to forgo their physical bodies for that purpose.
::::::::'''Herta:''' If you ask me, the Garden of Recollection, the Architects, The Family, and the Antimatter Legion are all idiots. They obsessively worship their Aeons.
:::::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::::{{DIcon|Talk}} Who are the Memokeepers?
::::::::'''Herta:''' They are members of the Garden of Recollection who travel between worlds to collect precious memories. You will run into them sooner or later. I bet the memory of a Astral Express passenger is highly sought after by them.
::::::::'''Herta:''' You could get lucky if you meet civilized Memokeepers, since they might use an amazing memory to exchange with yours. However, watch out for the Memosnatchers, the radicals in the Garden of Recollection. They won't give you a heads-up before stealing your memory.
:::::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can I touch the bubble now?
::::::::'''Herta:''' Sure~ Just touch it with your forehead. Remember to close your eyes, or your head will start spinning.
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine. I'll sign it.
:::::::'''Herta:''' Great...
:::::::You take the paper and pen from Herta and leave your signature. The paper is made from a bizarre material, and the ink dries up the moment it touches the paper. When you move the tip of the pen away, your heart suddenly flutters.
