::'''Helper Robot:''' (Trailblazer), you're here!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Anything wondrous happened lately?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where's the "surprise"?
::'''Helper Robot:''' Well...
::The Helper Robot gestures for you to look at the creation by its side.
::'''???:''' Are you blind? Haven't you noticed how splendidly magnificent I am?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} And you are?
:::'''Wisteria Cake:''' If we follow the Station Department of Ecology rules of nomenclature, then you can call me Wisteria Cake. Anything lucky enough to inherit these quality genetic traits can be called that, too.
:::You look like Herta...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look like Herta...
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' You're not the first one to say that.
::'''Helper Robot:''' It is the first creation of Ruan Mei's that's asked to see you.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Let me see this legendary (Trailblazer) then &mdash; show me what in holy heck people see.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take a good look.
:::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Hmm, pretty tall. Nice.
:::You came just to see me?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You came just to see me?
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Of course, I didn't.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' I didn't just come to see you.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' I'm researching my origin story &mdash; my background, my race, my genes, all of that stuff. Most of it is still blank to me.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Unfortunately, even with this brain of mine I still can't get the answer I'm looking for. My research has hit a bottleneck, and now I need your help.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What bottleneck?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know nothing about science.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Don't worry, just listen to this, so your ignorance doesn't impede my research.

::Wisteria Cake brings over a companion to you.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' Hello. I'm just here by invite. Don't mind me.
::'''Butler:''' ...Why did Miss Ruan Mei create you? *sniffle* This is not fair.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' Uhh...
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Shut up, you're such a scammer, acting all high and mighty. Don't ever talk to my friend like that again.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' Alright, apart from this arrogant friend of mine who won't quit stalking me &mdash; don't you feel surprised?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks... a little familiar.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like someone I know.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' She and I have very similar traits, which were caused by genetic mutations. But I have no idea as to why I might look like some of these other people you know.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' But I think it all has something to do with you. Isn't that right, (Trailblazer)?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't know.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't drag me into this.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' I suspect this is all connected on some kind of spiritual level...
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' But I have far too few samples to research, so that's why I'd like to ask for your help in nurturing more creations with a few more rare traits.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' If you really can't manage that, then nurture some more ordinary creations. I can get by, so long as I have enough samples.
::'''Helper Robot:''' Your research topic is exactly the same as that of the space station.
::'''Helper Robot:''' So, (Trailblazer), can you think of a way to nurture these rare creations? This is the last piece of the puzzle remaining for the space station's research program.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Lemme try.
:::'''Helper Robot:''' I believe in you.
:::...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' If you don't reply, should I take that as agreement?
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' It's fine since our goals are aligned. I have some things for you that you might find helpful with your nurturing job.

:'''Helper Robot:''' (Trailblazer), thank you for all your hard work over the past few days.
::'''Helper Robot:''' The space station's research has basically been completed. However, there's one last thing I'd like to task you with...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it?
:::'''Helper Robot:''' Don't worry, this is really easy.
:::One last thing, then.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} One last thing, then.
::'''Helper Robot:''' Yeah.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' To be precise, it's her who wants help with something.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' ...Well, it's me. You may have noticed that I have the same aura and traits as Ruan Mei herself.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' Even the creations here get the two of us mixed up.
::'''Butler:''' You really do look very similar to Miss Ruan Mei. That's actually why I keep following you around...
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' Everyone misses her so much, and I even hear some creations whimper "Mommy"... But unfortunately, I am not Ruan Mei.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' I want to do whatever I can for them...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you want Ruan Mei to pay them a visit?
:::'''Lambda's Friend:''' If she could, that would be best. But knowing her temperament, I don't think she'll be coming back.
:::What do you want to do?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you want to do?
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' I'd like you to take some group photos of everyone.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' You know all the tricks aboard the space station, so I know you must have a way of reaching Miss Ruan Mei.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' We'd like you to take some photos and send them to her.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' First up, here's my official request: A photo of me with her, and you have to send it to her. I'm curious about how she and Herta will react.
::'''Wisteria Cake:''' And then a group photo of all the other creations. You can take a few photos and send her all of them.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' And well, even if she leaves the messages unread, at least we'll be passing on everyone's feelings...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry, she'll definitely check it out.
::'''Lambda's Friend:''' I'm counting on you then.
::{{tx}}
