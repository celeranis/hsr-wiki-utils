:'''Helper Robot:''' (Trailblazer), how timely! Lead Researcher Asta has bought some sleeping supplies for the creations. She calls this a "Kitty Cot."

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Helper Robot
:{{tx}}
:'''Helper Robot:''' (Trailblazer), thanks to your efforts, many batches of creations have spawned. It's getting lively around here.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Ask it to help clean up)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Tell it what just happened)
:'''Helper Robot:''' I see. Well, they are still young, their minds not yet fully developed.
:'''Helper Robot:''' But these concerns of yours are also reasonable. Even if cleaning is performed daily, similar things will keep happening...
:'''Helper Robot:''' They have plenty of fun like this, but other creations will suffer.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If it doesn't work out, they can always be put up for adoption.
::'''Helper Robot:''' That won't work. Even if we put them up for adoption, similar situations will keep happening with other creations.
::'''Helper Robot:''' When the time comes, are you going to try and give away all the creations?
::Maybe we can teach them a lesson?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe we can teach them a lesson?
:'''Helper Robot:''' No, please don't. This is not good.
:'''Helper Robot:''' Different creations have different needs: Some like to have fun, some like to be quiet, some are sloppy, and some are germaphobes...
:'''Helper Robot:''' We can modify this zone and divide them by function to try and meet their needs to the greatest extent possible.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then what should we do?
::'''Helper Robot:''' Simple: Separate them according to their functionality.
::Are you talking about renovating?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you talking about renovating?
:'''Helper Robot:''' It's a similar concept, but it won't be as complicated in practice.
:'''Helper Robot:''' I have run some estimations. Their most basic needs are food and rest, and we have supplies on hand. It is wholly possible to create two separate areas based on that alone, and divide them according to their functions.
:'''Helper Robot:''' In the Dining Area, they just indulge in their meals. After eating, they can play nearby &mdash; everyone's eating, anyway, so they won't care.
:'''Helper Robot:''' Those in the Rest Area should be keeping quiet. Those who are done eating in the Dining Area or who have worn themselves out playing can come here for a good sleep.
:'''Helper Robot:''' This way... any differences or friction between them can be gradually reduced. You just need to teach them how to use the different areas.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do we have to move them around manually?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Should we teach them about all this?
:'''Helper Robot:''' The intelligence levels among creations vary. We need to come up with a comprehensive approach...
:'''Helper Robot:''' Images are the easiest way to get meaning across. You can spray a mark on the ground in the different areas, with graffiti of what the area is for to alleviate any confusion.
:'''Helper Robot:''' But...
:The Helper Robot awkwardly looks at you.
:'''Helper Robot:''' I'm sorry, but my levitation height is fixed and cannot be lowered... so...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fine, I'll do it!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me!
:'''Helper Robot:''' Then I'll leave it to you. The spray device has been installed. Once you've finished the spraying, you can accommodate the creations in the corresponding areas.
