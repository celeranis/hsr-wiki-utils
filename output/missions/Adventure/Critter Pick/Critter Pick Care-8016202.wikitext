===Accommodate all the creations inside the "Kitty Cot"{{subst:void|<!--801620202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Asta has bought a stack of sleeping supplies for the creations. The little ones need to rest too, so try moving them to a comfortable cot.<br />You knew without asking that all these things listed as "pet supplies" had to be paid for out of Asta's own pocket.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|With your support, the creations quickly adapt to the environment of the Seclusion Zone &mdash; but some creations are still super noisy. What's happened? Go find out.<br />In a sense, they were nurtured into existence by you. Does that make you... their parent?}}

===Seek advice from the Helper Robot{{subst:void|<!--801620205-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|The creations love this place, but too much excitement can be a bad thing. They made everything super messy in here. Let's get the Helper Robot to tidy up.<br />You seriously spoil them too much.}}

===Find a suitable place to plan out the Rest Area{{subst:void|<!--801620209-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Just nurturing them without teaching them is no good. Time for the creations to learn the rules of the space station. The Helper Robot suggests using sprayed symbols to divide out functional areas, which would help them to better tidy up the place regularly.<br />Speaking of which, where would be best to put our Rest Area?}}

===Spray the correct Rest Area symbol onto the floor{{subst:void|<!--801620206-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Upon careful observation, you confirm that this is a good place to cordon off as the Rest Area. Time to spray the right graffiti on the ground to help these illiterate creations get back to their resting spots.}}

===Report back to the Helper Robot.{{subst:void|<!--801620207-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Seclusion Zone|update|Splitting the place into functional areas was a great success. Time to go back and report to the Helper Robot with these results.
