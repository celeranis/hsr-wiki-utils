===Head to the suppression tower and talk with the Chess Ghost{{subst:void|<!--401540101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Fyxestroll Garden|The Chess Ghost &mdash; who hasn't been quiet for long &mdash; has started looking for someone to play chess with near the suppression tower again. It seems that its significant defeat last time wasn't enough to make the lesson sink in. You can check out what new tricks it has up its sleeve.}}

;(Talk to Chess Ghost)
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Hey, consider yourself lucky today to have received guidance from a master like me.
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Come, then. I'm about to unfold the Pathfinder. You should listen, observe, and think lots. If you don't understand something, just ask me...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who are you, great master?
::'''Chess Ghost:''' Who am I? How can you not recognize me? Who are YOU?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Master, do you not recognize me?
::'''Chess Ghost:''' Busy people have short memories. It shouldn't come as a surprise that I can't seem to recall who you are.
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Hm. Why do you look so familiar...
:'''Chess Ghost:''' Damnation! You... you feckless, insidious little... to obtain victory through such conniving... oh, you don't seem to have used any dastardly tricks to win...
:'''Chess Ghost:''' However! I must avenge myself of the shame of defeat today! You! Dare you accept a duel?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...But what you're doing can't really be called chess...
::'''Chess Ghost:''' What's it to you? Make your chess move! We'll see how long your mouth stays smart!
::'''Chess Ghost:''' Silence. Spare me your words and show me your skill.
