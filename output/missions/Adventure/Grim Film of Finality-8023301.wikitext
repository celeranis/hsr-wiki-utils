{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Dreamflux Reef|update|According to the address given by Dr. Edward, you arrive at "the city chiseled from the Primordial Dreamscape." However, there is no one here that looks like a "collaborative partner." The only thing here is a bizarre puppet. Could this be... Dr. Edward's "partner"?}}

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who are you?
::'''Elegy:''' I seek the traces of Finality. You can call me Elegy.

::The puppet wearing a black veil over her face doesn't move, yet you somehow feel that she gave you a small curtsy.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You know me?
:::'''Elegy:''' I've known you for longer than you can imagine, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer).
:::'''Elegy:''' I come from your Finality in search of the {{Rubi|shapeless prince|one against the current}}.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you dressed in mourning attire?
:::'''Elegy:''' Because I'm the one who mourns for the dying world.
:::'''Elegy:''' Time is flowing backward, and the world becomes increasingly fragmented every moment in &mdash; that's what I mourn for.
::'''Elegy:''' You're here for those Apocalyptic Shadows, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you make dream bubbles for Dr. Edward?
::'''Elegy:''' You can see it that way, but Dr. Edward and I have different destinations. We only complement each other's needs {{Rubi|at this moment|where time intersects}}.
::'''Elegy:''' I travel between civilizations at the moment of their obliteration and track down intelligence from countless annihilated worlds. As for Dr. Edward, he attaches more importance to the... "commercial value" of these traces.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a History Fictionologist?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a Messenger from the Garden of Recollection?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you a Mourning Actor?
::'''Elegy:''' No, I'm not mourning the worlds that are {{Rubi|already|eventually}} destroyed, but the {{Rubi|future|past}} that is destined to reach to Finality.
::'''Elegy:''' Seeking traces of Finality... That is the calling of us Creed Exequies.
::'''Elegy:''' {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer), memory is the breeding ground of dreams. Behind each of the many do-or-die battles you have experienced lies a potential Finality. The traces of Finality can probably be found therein.
::'''Elegy:''' I'll reward you generously for your help. Would you be willing to share your {{Rubi|past|future}} dreams with me?
;(If {{cx}}<!--not during performance 802330102-->)
::'''Elegy:''' (Trailblazer), are you ready to gaze at the projection of Finality?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What should I do?

::'''Elegy:''' Your subconscious has tampered with the real experience. The most terrifying experiences do not exist in the outside world but within one's soul.

:'''Elegy:''' Because you have received THEIR grace.
:'''Elegy:''' Wherever you walk, you are under THEIR gaze. What you practice is also THEIR prophecy that has {{Rubi|already been|yet to be}} announced. The stars are THEIR eyes, and the breeze is THEIR hands. Every disaster that befalls you is a revelation of Finality.
