:{{DIcon|Talk}} Verax Leo
:There is a sculpture of a lion's head on the wall, its maw wide open.
:In some of the worlds you traversed, the lion's teeth are usually rubbed smooth by touching hands. Passersby can't help but feel an urge to thrust their hands in its mouth. You decide to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Put your hand into the lion's mouth)
::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho! Let's see, who has come to visit my majestic self again? A warrior from outlands!
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I refuse to answer?
:::'''Verax Leo:''' O-ho? Even those in pursuit of wisdom may find it out of their reach. The ones who abhor wisdom might never even have a glimpse of it.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright! Let's do this.
:::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, listen well. There is something in this world that: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"Has a head and tail but no belly. Can gallop, but has no legs. Loved when seen from afar, dreaded when landing on your head."}}
:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll tell you!
::::Haha, having traveled the Cosmos for so long, you've surely seen your fair share of riddlers. It's all about spontaneity &mdash; you already have an answer in mind.
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Astral Express.
:::::Got a carriage head and a tail, warmly welcomed wherever it goes. And your dreamscape experiences have proven that the Express packs a mammoth punch when it hurtles down from the sky.
:::::You confidently puff your chest &mdash; it's the Astral Express. This was a riddle that was simply tailor-made for you.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, a very refreshing take. Shame it is not the correct answer!
:::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::Aglaea's golden thread.
:::::This answer is definitely right. Everyone in Okhema loves clothes woven from gold thread, but not all of them can withstand the interrogation from these threads.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? You associated it with Lady Aglaea? Alas, that's still not the right answer!
:::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::Rumors and gossip.
:::::Your experience with the Rosy Celestial Maiden has taught you: Nothing travels faster than rumors, and nothing stirs more enmity than rumors. This is the most frightening fact about them.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, really? Are you sure? This is your answer?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' C&mdash;Curses, it is correct... It's the correct answeraahhhh...
:::::The lion's maw remains sadly still, every stone-carved mane frozen in abject dejection.
:::::Ha! You've solved the lion's riddle. You are now its "Wallbreaker"!
:::::Just kidding...It doesn't look like it's going to lunge out of the wall at all. It is completely still.
:::::...Better go get a second opinion.
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::Calm down. You recall your new Chrysos Heirs friends. How about asking for their help?
:::::What would Mydei say?
:::::You remember that Mydei has dealt with a certain lion's mouth once. Of course, he would know these lions' tricks. Let's get him here...
:::::'''Mydei:''' ...Why do you want me to put my hand inside?
:::::I believe in you.
:::::I'm scared.
:::::To pay respects to the legendary Bite-Enduring King.
:::::'''Mydei:''' All right, fine. The answer should be something called molten waterfall in my hometown.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Castrum Kremnos' citizens are accustomed to hot baths, but if you pour boiling molten iron over your head, even the bravest individual would quake in his shoes.
:::::That's right, it should be a "molten waterfall."
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh, oh-ho, this familiar tone... I knew it was Lord Mydei's suggestion.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' I do not doubt Lord Mydei's courage one bit, hehe. Alas, it is a wrong answer.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Hmph... You're very brave.
:::::Though the lion's jaw clamps down hard, Mydei's expression does not change at all. Instead, it is the stone-forged mouth that is quivering.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' I&mdash;I apologize! Lord Mydei, please do not break me!
:::::Mydei shakes off the pain on his hand and leaves with an expression of displeasure...
:::::Let's think about it.
:::::How about asking Tribbie, Trinnon, and Trianne?
:::::They may be delivering letters to people in the city. Let's try sending a message anyway.
:::::Ding-dong! Message sent successfully. You haven't even had time to put down your phone when you see three replies pop up...
:::::'''Tribbie:''' Is it a meteor?
:::::'''Trinnon:''' Meteor.
:::::'''Trianne:''' Yahoo! Meteor!
:::::'''Tribbie:''' It is hard to see a sky of stars under the shine of the Dawn Device. But '''we''' know that in a very distant past when night and day still took turns, there were meteors with long trails streaking across the sky!
:::::That's right. Meteor.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, how romantic! If my neck weren't made of stone, I would have raised my head to gaze at the stars. Alas, that is a wrong answer.
:::::It hurts. It hurts so much that you want to go cry at your cute aides. But when you think of their assured tone, you decide to abandon any intent of conveying your failure.
:::::Let's think about it.
:::::What does Phainon think?
:::::You recall the first trustworthy companion you befriended in Amphoreus, Phainon. He will surely respond to your request.
:::::'''Phainon:''' ...There's such a bizarre creature? I've seen plenty of weird beasts, but none without legs or belly.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' It's the great hero Phainon! Quick, what is your answer?
:::::'''Phainon:''' Could it be... a particular kind of chimera?
:::::'''Phainon:''' Ugh!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Fantastic! I bit the great hero Phainon! I won't brush my teeth for the rest of my life!
:::::'''Phainon:''' Err... You got it wrong, but it looks pretty happy.
:::::Phainon leaves with his head lowered, his mind still foraging for the right answer...
:::::It's better to believe in yourself!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh dear, I have no choice but to announce the right answer &mdash; it's rumors and gossip.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' You still need an explanation? Just think about it: Rumors have no legs, but can travel faster than anything else!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Those with ears love listening to the gossip of others. Those with brains fear that the rumors will befall right on top of them!
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? This is it?
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I've seen this scene somewhere...
:::::It's as if you can see the lion swishing its non-existent tail, flashing a toothy, mocking grin at you... You should've thought of it! The answer was practically written all over this loose-tongued lion's face.

:::::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
:::::::The Astral Express.
:::::::Got a carriage head and a tail, warmly welcomed wherever it goes. And your dreamscape experiences have proven that the Express packs a mammoth punch when it hurtles down from the sky.
:::::::You confidently puff your chest &mdash; it's the Astral Express. This was a riddle that was simply tailor-made for you.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, a very refreshing take. Shame it is not the correct answer!
:::::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::::Aglaea's golden thread.
:::::::This answer is definitely right. Everyone in Okhema loves clothes woven from gold thread, but not all of them can withstand the interrogation from these threads.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? You associated it with Lady Aglaea? Alas, that's still not the right answer!
:::::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::::Rumors and gossip.
:::::::Your experience with the Rosy Celestial Maiden has taught you: Nothing travels faster than rumors, and nothing stirs more enmity than rumors. This is the most frightening fact about them.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, really? Are you sure? This is your answer?
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' C&mdash;Curses, it is correct... It's the correct answeraahhhh...
:::::::The lion's maw remains sadly still, every stone-carved mane frozen in abject dejection.
:::::::Ha! You've solved the lion's riddle. You are now its "Wallbreaker"!
:::::::Just kidding...It doesn't look like it's going to lunge out of the wall at all. It is completely still.
:::::::...Better go get a second opinion.
:::::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::::Calm down. You recall your new Chrysos Heirs friends. How about asking for their help?
:::::::What would Mydei say?
:::::::You remember that Mydei has dealt with a certain lion's mouth once. Of course, he would know these lions' tricks. Let's get him here...
:::::::'''Mydei:''' ...Why do you want me to put my hand inside?
:::::::I believe in you.
:::::::I'm scared.
:::::::To pay respects to the legendary Bite-Enduring King.
:::::::'''Mydei:''' All right, fine. The answer should be something called molten waterfall in my hometown.
:::::::'''Mydei:''' Castrum Kremnos' citizens are accustomed to hot baths, but if you pour boiling molten iron over your head, even the bravest individual would quake in his shoes.
:::::::That's right, it should be a "molten waterfall."
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh, oh-ho, this familiar tone... I knew it was Lord Mydei's suggestion.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' I do not doubt Lord Mydei's courage one bit, hehe. Alas, it is a wrong answer.
:::::::'''Mydei:''' Hmph... You're very brave.
:::::::Though the lion's jaw clamps down hard, Mydei's expression does not change at all. Instead, it is the stone-forged mouth that is quivering.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' I&mdash;I apologize! Lord Mydei, please do not break me!
:::::::Mydei shakes off the pain on his hand and leaves with an expression of displeasure...
:::::::Let's think about it.
:::::::How about asking Tribbie, Trinnon, and Trianne?
:::::::They may be delivering letters to people in the city. Let's try sending a message anyway.
:::::::Ding-dong! Message sent successfully. You haven't even had time to put down your phone when you see three replies pop up...
:::::::'''Tribbie:''' Is it a meteor?
:::::::'''Trinnon:''' Meteor.
:::::::'''Trianne:''' Yahoo! Meteor!
:::::::'''Tribbie:''' It is hard to see a sky of stars under the shine of the Dawn Device. But '''we''' know that in a very distant past when night and day still took turns, there were meteors with long trails streaking across the sky!
:::::::That's right. Meteor.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, how romantic! If my neck weren't made of stone, I would have raised my head to gaze at the stars. Alas, that is a wrong answer.
:::::::It hurts. It hurts so much that you want to go cry at your cute aides. But when you think of their assured tone, you decide to abandon any intent of conveying your failure.
:::::::Let's think about it.
:::::::What does Phainon think?
:::::::You recall the first trustworthy companion you befriended in Amphoreus, Phainon. He will surely respond to your request.
:::::::'''Phainon:''' ...There's such a bizarre creature? I've seen plenty of weird beasts, but none without legs or belly.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' It's the great hero Phainon! Quick, what is your answer?
:::::::'''Phainon:''' Could it be... a particular kind of chimera?
:::::::'''Phainon:''' Ugh!
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Fantastic! I bit the great hero Phainon! I won't brush my teeth for the rest of my life!
:::::::'''Phainon:''' Err... You got it wrong, but it looks pretty happy.
:::::::Phainon leaves with his head lowered, his mind still foraging for the right answer...
:::::::It's better to believe in yourself!
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh dear, I have no choice but to announce the right answer &mdash; it's rumors and gossip.
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' You still need an explanation? Just think about it: Rumors have no legs, but can travel faster than anything else!
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Those with ears love listening to the gossip of others. Those with brains fear that the rumors will befall right on top of them!
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? This is it?
:::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I've seen this scene somewhere...
:::::::It's as if you can see the lion swishing its non-existent tail, flashing a toothy, mocking grin at you... You should've thought of it! The answer was practically written all over this loose-tongued lion's face.

:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, listen well. There is something in this world that: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"Has a head and tail but no belly. Can gallop, but has no legs. Loved when seen from afar, dreaded when landing on your head."}}
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' ...Question: What is it?
:::::Who knew this seemingly distasteful lion actually came up with a good riddle. But this should be pretty easy for one like you, who has seen the broader horizons of the universe, no?
:::::I'll tell you!
:::::Haha, having traveled the Cosmos for so long, you've surely seen your fair share of riddlers. It's all about spontaneity &mdash; you already have an answer in mind.
:::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
:::::The Astral Express.
:::::Got a carriage head and a tail, warmly welcomed wherever it goes. And your dreamscape experiences have proven that the Express packs a mammoth punch when it hurtles down from the sky.
:::::You confidently puff your chest &mdash; it's the Astral Express. This was a riddle that was simply tailor-made for you.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, a very refreshing take. Shame it is not the correct answer!
:::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::Aglaea's golden thread.
:::::This answer is definitely right. Everyone in Okhema loves clothes woven from gold thread, but not all of them can withstand the interrogation from these threads.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? You associated it with Lady Aglaea? Alas, that's still not the right answer!
:::::Ouch! This lion bit you! You check your wound in a panic &mdash; good thing your arm is still there.
:::::Rumors and gossip.
:::::Your experience with the Rosy Celestial Maiden has taught you: Nothing travels faster than rumors, and nothing stirs more enmity than rumors. This is the most frightening fact about them.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, really? Are you sure? This is your answer?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' C&mdash;Curses, it is correct... It's the correct answeraahhhh...
:::::The lion's maw remains sadly still, every stone-carved mane frozen in abject dejection.
:::::Ha! You've solved the lion's riddle. You are now its "Wallbreaker"!
:::::Just kidding...It doesn't look like it's going to lunge out of the wall at all. It is completely still.
:::::...Better go get a second opinion.
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::Calm down. You recall your new Chrysos Heirs friends. How about asking for their help?
:::::What would Mydei say?
:::::You remember that Mydei has dealt with a certain lion's mouth once. Of course, he would know these lions' tricks. Let's get him here...
:::::'''Mydei:''' ...Why do you want me to put my hand inside?
:::::I believe in you.
:::::I'm scared.
:::::To pay respects to the legendary Bite-Enduring King.
:::::'''Mydei:''' All right, fine. The answer should be something called molten waterfall in my hometown.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Castrum Kremnos' citizens are accustomed to hot baths, but if you pour boiling molten iron over your head, even the bravest individual would quake in his shoes.
:::::That's right, it should be a "molten waterfall."
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh, oh-ho, this familiar tone... I knew it was Lord Mydei's suggestion.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' I do not doubt Lord Mydei's courage one bit, hehe. Alas, it is a wrong answer.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Hmph... You're very brave.
:::::Though the lion's jaw clamps down hard, Mydei's expression does not change at all. Instead, it is the stone-forged mouth that is quivering.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' I&mdash;I apologize! Lord Mydei, please do not break me!
:::::Mydei shakes off the pain on his hand and leaves with an expression of displeasure...
:::::Let's think about it.
:::::How about asking Tribbie, Trinnon, and Trianne?
:::::They may be delivering letters to people in the city. Let's try sending a message anyway.
:::::Ding-dong! Message sent successfully. You haven't even had time to put down your phone when you see three replies pop up...
:::::'''Tribbie:''' Is it a meteor?
:::::'''Trinnon:''' Meteor.
:::::'''Trianne:''' Yahoo! Meteor!
:::::'''Tribbie:''' It is hard to see a sky of stars under the shine of the Dawn Device. But '''we''' know that in a very distant past when night and day still took turns, there were meteors with long trails streaking across the sky!
:::::That's right. Meteor.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, how romantic! If my neck weren't made of stone, I would have raised my head to gaze at the stars. Alas, that is a wrong answer.
:::::It hurts. It hurts so much that you want to go cry at your cute aides. But when you think of their assured tone, you decide to abandon any intent of conveying your failure.
:::::Let's think about it.
:::::What does Phainon think?
:::::You recall the first trustworthy companion you befriended in Amphoreus, Phainon. He will surely respond to your request.
:::::'''Phainon:''' ...There's such a bizarre creature? I've seen plenty of weird beasts, but none without legs or belly.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' It's the great hero Phainon! Quick, what is your answer?
:::::'''Phainon:''' Could it be... a particular kind of chimera?
:::::'''Phainon:''' Ugh!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Fantastic! I bit the great hero Phainon! I won't brush my teeth for the rest of my life!
:::::'''Phainon:''' Err... You got it wrong, but it looks pretty happy.
:::::Phainon leaves with his head lowered, his mind still foraging for the right answer...
:::::It's better to believe in yourself!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh dear, I have no choice but to announce the right answer &mdash; it's rumors and gossip.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' You still need an explanation? Just think about it: Rumors have no legs, but can travel faster than anything else!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Those with ears love listening to the gossip of others. Those with brains fear that the rumors will befall right on top of them!
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What? This is it?
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I've seen this scene somewhere...
:::::It's as if you can see the lion swishing its non-existent tail, flashing a toothy, mocking grin at you... You should've thought of it! The answer was practically written all over this loose-tongued lion's face.

:::::...Ask Mydei?
:::::Is Mydei's math really better than yours? You still feel apprehensive even as you send the message.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Such a disgustingly long-winded problem. This rabble of lions is getting creative.
:::::'''Mydei:''' You took away the dromas, and borrowed 200,000 from the dromas merchant. Add them all up, it's 400,000 Balance Coins obviously... What? That weasely merchant hiked the price another 50,000?
:::::It's very reasonable to only repay 400,000!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Dead wrong! Ho-ho, the ability of a brave outsider exceeds {{MC|f=her|m=his}} repute. How would one learn without suffering the consequences?
:::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
:::::'''Mydei:''' ...Sorry, just consider this punishment a trial of the flesh.
:::::Mydei leaves without even looking back, and you see him scratching his head in the distance...
:::::Something's not right here.
:::::No... This whole calculation process just makes you want to scream out "Objection!". You need to rally your thoughts.
:::::...Ask Phainon?
:::::For some reason, you are inexplicably confident in Phainon's math ability. Or maybe it's because he looks like someone who listens intently in class?
:::::'''Phainon:''' If you aren't careful, you'd think the sum is 400,000!
:::::'''Phainon:''' But there's an obvious trap here. The price tag of 200,000 was already given to the merchant when you bought the dromas. You just need to pay what you owe to the merchant now &mdash; 200,000 Balance Coins is enough.
:::::'''Phainon:''' As for the price hike... nowhere in the legal constitution does it state it needs to be repaid.
:::::I totally got it! It's 200k!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Dead wrong! Ho-ho, the ability of a brave outsider exceeds {{MC|f=her|m=his}} repute. How would one learn without suffering the consequences?

:::::...Ask Aglaea?
:::::You repeat the problem to Aglaea over the comms... She chuckles right after hearing the first sentence.
:::::'''Aglaea:''' It's a 500,000 fine.
:::::'''Aglaea:''' Dromases are the divine creations of {{Rubi|Georios|Earth Titan}}. They are only available for rental &mdash; private sale is forbidden.

:::::'''Verax Leo:''' An appropriate silence is a virtue. Without further ado, I shall announce the right answer!
:::::Something's not right here.
:::::Hang on, isn't this a math question? It's best not to involve real-world rules in the problem.
:::::It's better to believe in yourself!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho! The correct answer is... it doesn't cost a single coin!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' That is because the date for this deal was unfortunately during the "Month of Fortune" &mdash; In Okhema's calendar, the twelfth month is the Month of Fortune, which belongs to {{Rubi|Zagreus|Trickery Titan}}.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' No one knows how many days the Month of Fortune would have without reaching the end of the month. There could suddenly be an extra day... which is called a {{Rubi|Spirit Day|Leap Day}}!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' And the day you and the dromas merchant arranged for repayment is on the last day of the month. Before the Spirit Day appears, even the most sagacious judge in Okhema would be unable to determine which day is the "last day of the month" the contract is referring to.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' No one would be able to fulfill the same contract on two different days. Thus, you don't need to fork out a single coin.

:::::Check for phonetic traps in the question.
:::::You check and double-check, confirming that what you bought is indeed a dromas, not a tromas, or a bromas, successfully avoiding any typical merchant scam tactics.
:::::Looks like this lion didn't set up any wordplay traps in the question, at least to your knowledge.
:::::Speak your answer loud and proud!
:::::That's right, what is there to suspect? You can practically do the mental calculation for such a juvenile math problem.
:::::250,000 Balance Coins!
:::::You are an existence even more Lawful Good than the most law-abiding citizens of Okhema. Even {{Rubi|Talanton|Law Titan}} would applaud your devotion to upholding an agreement.
:::::Wrong! Ho-ho, I said that EVERY WORD is essential!
:::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
:::::450,000 Balance Coins!
:::::Really? Are you absolutely sure? If you really run into such a circumstance, I hope someone stops you before you whip out your wallet.
:::::Wrong! Ho-ho, I said that EVERY WORD is essential!
:::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
:::::200,000 Balance Coins!
:::::That's right, you are genius at calculating. For matters like debt settlement, precision is right up your street.
:::::Wrong! Ho-ho, I said that EVERY WORD is essential!
:::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
:::::...Better go get a second opinion.
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::You never once systematically experienced the trials of advanced mathematics, even while at Paperfold University. Then, who in Okhema looks like someone who's good with numbers?
:::::...Ask Mydei?
:::::Is Mydei's math really better than yours? You still feel apprehensive even as you send the message.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Such a disgustingly long-winded problem. This rabble of lions is getting creative.
:::::'''Mydei:''' You took away the dromas, and borrowed 200,000 from the dromas merchant. Add them all up, it's 400,000 Balance Coins obviously... What? That weasely merchant hiked the price another 50,000?
:::::It's very reasonable to only repay 400,000!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Dead wrong! Ho-ho, the ability of a brave outsider exceeds {{MC|f=her|m=his}} repute. How would one learn without suffering the consequences?
:::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
:::::'''Mydei:''' ...Sorry, just consider this punishment a trial of the flesh.
:::::Mydei leaves without even looking back, and you see him scratching his head in the distance...
:::::Something's not right here.
:::::No... This whole calculation process just makes you want to scream out "Objection!". You need to rally your thoughts.
:::::...Ask Phainon?
:::::For some reason, you are inexplicably confident in Phainon's math ability. Or maybe it's because he looks like someone who listens intently in class?
:::::'''Phainon:''' If you aren't careful, you'd think the sum is 400,000!
:::::'''Phainon:''' But there's an obvious trap here. The price tag of 200,000 was already given to the merchant when you bought the dromas. You just need to pay what you owe to the merchant now &mdash; 200,000 Balance Coins is enough.
:::::'''Phainon:''' As for the price hike... nowhere in the legal constitution does it state it needs to be repaid.
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I totally got it! It's 200k!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Dead wrong! Ho-ho, the ability of a brave outsider exceeds {{MC|f=her|m=his}} repute. How would one learn without suffering the consequences?
::::::Owwch! Didn't expect it to bite... But, what exactly did you get wrong?
::::::'''Phainon:''' I'm sorry! Are you all right? Do you need treatment?!
::::::Phainon bandages your completely unwounded arm for you, then leaves apologetically...
::::::Something's not right here.
::::::An overly '''correct''' answer. But you are clear that this lion won't let you off so easily.
::::::...Ask Aglaea?
::::::You repeat the problem to Aglaea over the comms... She chuckles right after hearing the first sentence.
::::::'''Aglaea:''' It's a 500,000 fine.
::::::'''Aglaea:''' Dromases are the divine creations of {{Rubi|Georios|Earth Titan}}. They are only available for rental &mdash; private sale is forbidden.
::::::The gall! How dare you illegally sell dromases!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh, oh-ho! Th&mdash;This was an intentional trap... I&mdash;I would never dare blaspheme the divine Titans, ho-ho...
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' An appropriate silence is a virtue. Without further ado, I shall announce the right answer!
::::::Something's not right here.
::::::Hang on, isn't this a math question? It's best not to involve real-world rules in the problem.
::::::It's better to believe in yourself!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho! The correct answer is... it doesn't cost a single coin!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' That is because the date for this deal was unfortunately during the "Month of Fortune" &mdash; In Okhema's calendar, the twelfth month is the Month of Fortune, which belongs to {{Rubi|Zagreus|Trickery Titan}}.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' No one knows how many days the Month of Fortune would have without reaching the end of the month. There could suddenly be an extra day... which is called a {{Rubi|Spirit Day|Leap Day}}!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' And the day you and the dromas merchant arranged for repayment is on the last day of the month. Before the Spirit Day appears, even the most sagacious judge in Okhema would be unable to determine which day is the "last day of the month" the contract is referring to.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' No one would be able to fulfill the same contract on two different days. Thus, you don't need to fork out a single coin.
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't this just sophistry?
:::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho! Just a little trick up my proverbial sleeve. I have reminded you before that every word in the question is equally important!
:::::::This isn't a math problem at all...
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This isn't a math problem at all...
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? I wonder how many paradoxes were discovered by mathematicians?
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Moreover, I am not the only one adept at paradoxical plays in this city. I learned it from the plaza, streets, and justice court!

::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I refuse to answer?

::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright! Let's do this.
:::'''Verax Leo:''' Look who's come to visit this lion, a brave outsider. Back for more brain-teasers?
:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try thinking about it yourself.
::::That's totally you! A sense of humor... You've never lacked in this department. Be it the dad jokes that silence the audience, or all sorts of puns, you know 'em all like the back of your hand.
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This ball bat!
:::::It's none other than the Galactic Baseballer's weapon itself! It has beaten down countless opponents, but... who can let a ball bat stand on its own? Even {{Rubi|the Titan|Zagreus}} renowned for their cunning and trickery would be hard-pressed to achieve this.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, it's a little funny, but not by much. And the answer's too general. If that's the case, wouldn't Nikador's lance also be the answer?
:::::OUCH! This lion bit you... It was just a wisecrack...
:::::Verax Leo.
:::::That's right, the answer is the lion before you. You've learned to turn the tables on its answers.
:::::Likes to stump the answerer with bizarre riddles, eager to outsmart others in a battle of wits. But a lion without limbs and paws probably can't '''stand'''.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Heh-heh, your logic is sound, but this answer does not make me laugh. Your words are too candid!
:::::It's angry! You've got the wrong answer, but you feel like you've won this round!
:::::Bath soap.
:::::Bath soap is a staple in Okhema's baths. It could also slide all around like sloppy mud when dropped on the floor. The unfortunate soul who slips on it can only fall.
:::::At the same time, you're very sure that sloppy mud can't stick to walls.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? Interesting, interesting. You're either an unlucky fool or a master prankster. Either way, I am highly amused, hahaha...
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' I'll consider it the right answer. While I am laughing with my jaw wide open, you should quickly take your hand out!
:::::Boohoo, I am a humorless cretin.
:::::All right, even the greatest comedic geniuses will sometimes be at a loss for words. Your sense of humor has already been exhausted &mdash; all you have will be terrible jokes. You should just give yourself a break.
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::Are you sure that you have friends in Okhema who have a better sense of humor than you? Who will you invite to answer this riddle?
:::::Let's ask Castorice.
:::::'''Castorice:''' ...So, (Trailblazer), you think I'm funny?
:::::Of course, I believe in you.
:::::No, I just want to see you get bitten.
:::::'''Castorice:''' I don't know why you'd want to see that... but I'm also curious how it feels.
:::::'''Castorice:''' This question vexes me somewhat. The answer... is probably "twisted logic."
:::::'''Castorice:''' I remember that I listened to a few outstanding debate sessions when I was studying at the Grove. Hypothetically speaking, if logic is divided into sound and twisted, the latter often employs trickery to refute the former, but twisted logic is fundamentally flawed.
:::::'''Castorice:''' Sorry... That's all I can think of. I hope it helps.
:::::I agree. It's "twisted logic."
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Yaaawn. A flawless answer, completely fitting of sound logic. Alas, this answer is too middling. It lacks humor!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' ...
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Then... please take your hand out. I've heard about you, and I don't want to die yet.
:::::'''Castorice:''' ...Oh.
:::::Castorice bows to you and the lion, and departs reluctantly...
:::::That doesn't sound right.
:::::Twisted logic... Is this answer humorous enough? Let's get a second opinion.
:::::Let's ask Phainon.
:::::'''Phainon:''' Literally speaking, I'm guessing it is {{Rubi|Kephale|Worldbearing Titan}}.
:::::'''Phainon:''' Because it has to bear the Dawn Device, so it can't '''stand''' up... Hmm? Is this joke not deadpan enough?
:::::Excellent! The answer is Kephale!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' ...It's so, so bad, it's making the hair stand on their ends!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' While I'm recovering from that bad joke, hurry and take your hand away!
:::::'''Phainon:''' To think the joke that offends Kephale is deadpan humor, humor is certainly an art...
:::::That doesn't sound right.
:::::It's pretty funny, but you feel like you've committed the sin of blasphemy by making Kephale the butt of the joke. Let's ask what someone else thinks.
:::::Or maybe, let's ask Aglaea?
:::::You're a little worried that Aglaea might dislike meaningless jokes, but her voice over the comms doesn't sound too perturbed. She even sounds... amused.
:::::'''Aglaea:''' The Council of Elders.
:::::Aglaea's answer is simple, yet determined. You can't help but contemplate the deeper meaning behind it... The Council of Elders crushes others with its authority, but it can't stand because... Forget it, jokes stop being funny when you dissect them.
:::::That's right, it's the Council of Elders.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? It is inconvenient for me to speak ill of Okhema's political affairs, but I am very happy to listen to jokes that allude to such matters!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' What an answer! Amazing! I acknowledge your sense of humor! Quickly, take your hand away!

::::::Castorice bows to you and the lion, and departs reluctantly...
::::::That doesn't sound right.
::::::Twisted logic... Is this answer humorous enough? Let's get a second opinion.
::::::Let's ask Phainon.
::::::'''Phainon:''' Literally speaking, I'm guessing it is {{Rubi|Kephale|Worldbearing Titan}}.
::::::'''Phainon:''' Because it has to bear the Dawn Device, so it can't '''stand''' up... Hmm? Is this joke not deadpan enough?
::::::Excellent! The answer is Kephale!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' ...It's so, so bad, it's making the hair stand on their ends!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' While I'm recovering from that bad joke, hurry and take your hand away!
::::::'''Phainon:''' To think the joke that offends Kephale is deadpan humor, humor is certainly an art...
::::::That doesn't sound right.
::::::It's pretty funny, but you feel like you've committed the sin of blasphemy by making Kephale the butt of the joke. Let's ask what someone else thinks.
::::::Or maybe, let's ask Aglaea?
::::::You're a little worried that Aglaea might dislike meaningless jokes, but her voice over the comms doesn't sound too perturbed. She even sounds... amused.
::::::'''Aglaea:''' The Council of Elders.
::::::Aglaea's answer is simple, yet determined. You can't help but contemplate the deeper meaning behind it... The Council of Elders crushes others with its authority, but it can't stand because... Forget it, jokes stop being funny when you dissect them.
::::::That's right, it's the Council of Elders.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? It is inconvenient for me to speak ill of Okhema's political affairs, but I am very happy to listen to jokes that allude to such matters!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' What an answer! Amazing! I acknowledge your sense of humor! Quickly, take your hand away!
::::::That doesn't sound right.
::::::As an outsider, it may not be appropriate to be discussing Okhema's administrative affairs. Better ask for someone else's opinion.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Verax Leo
:There is a sculpture of a lion's head on the wall, its maw wide open.
:In some of the worlds you traversed, the lion's teeth are usually rubbed smooth by touching hands. Passersby can't help but feel an urge to thrust their hands in its mouth. You decide to...

::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Can I refuse to answer?
:::'''Verax Leo:''' O-ho? Even those in pursuit of wisdom may find it out of their reach. The ones who abhor wisdom might never even have a glimpse of it.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright! Let's do this.
:::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, listen well, my question is: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"What results in two people being left with nothing, whether it is in the hands of either person?"}}
:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try thinking about it yourself.
::::Left with nothing. This phrase is not alien to you. When you awoke in the space station, that was what you were. Think hard, what is the thing that is closest to the feeling you had back then?
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} An exam paper with zero points.
:::::"Zero Points!" A familiar voice echoes in your mind. Undoubtedly, an exam paper with zero points is something that you own that equals to nothing.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, is that so? While a person who scored zero on an exam gets no rewards, there may be punishment awaiting them. How is that nothing? Let's see, this lion's punishment is about to commence...
:::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
:::::Philosophical thinking.
:::::That's right. You saw that in a book: The utility of knowledge is to expunge prejudice &mdash; "All I know is that I know nothing." This is truly being left with nothing.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? Brave outsider, could you have picked the brains of Okhema's philosophers? Alas, though you have a pocketful of clever rhetoric, this is a wrong answer.
:::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
:::::A piece of gear that enhances all the wrong sub stats.
:::::What concept could be more "nothing" than something that ardently strengthens you in the wrong direction? Investing all your resources, only to end up with something that you don't need &mdash; You will never want to experience this pain a second time.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, a poignant answer. Those who see it are saddened, and those who hear it are tearing up! Alas, such an artifact should only be left in your own bag, never to be gifted to someone else. This is not the right answer.
:::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
:::::I can't think of anything...
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::There's no shame in seeking help from others. Which friend from Okhema would you like to seek help from for answering this tricky question?
:::::How about asking Tribbie, Trinnon, and Trianne?
:::::The message is sent, and they reply in their usual speedy manner.
:::::'''Trianne:''' What could it be? A lost package?
:::::'''Trinnon:''' Mmm... as long as it's something left in '''our''' hands, we'll always deliver it to the receiver's hands.
:::::'''Tribbie:''' Unless it's a very absent-minded messenger who lost the parcel. If that's the case, the sender, and receiver will both be empty-handed, left with nothing!
:::::It is a parcel lost by a careless messenger.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, a parcel lost by a messenger never made it into the receiver's hands in the first place! How can that be considered "in their hands"? Alas, this is a wrong answer.
:::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
:::::Think again?
:::::Let's take the girls' answer into consideration, and seek another's opinion in the meantime.
:::::Try asking Castorice.
:::::'''Castorice:''' ...From what I have experienced, it is "hatred."
:::::'''Castorice:''' In the battlefields of Era Bellica, I once witnessed many tragic scenes, and countless wars were caused by hatred and vengeance between cities and people.
:::::'''Castorice:''' Refusing to let go of hatred in their hands would only result in... a war that leaves both parties with nothing.
:::::That's right. It's hatred that people refuse to let go.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? Hatred? An interesting perspective. Even if it's not what I was thinking, it rivals the original answer...
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Vengeance only begets more vengeance. Fine, I have decided to free your hand. This is but a friendly exchange of answers, ho-ho-ho.
:::::Think again?
:::::You feel that this lion prefers answers off the beaten path. Let's ask someone else's thoughts.
:::::What would Mydei say?
:::::'''Mydei:''' Hmph! More shenanigans from this bunch of trickster lions. Haven't they and their kind given up on torturing others with their despicable riddles?
:::::'''Mydei:''' My answer is... a wavering will. If a warrior's heart wavers even slightly when charging at their enemy, then death would be their only outcome.
:::::'''Mydei:''' Also, if one's will wavers, one's morale will dissipate, and the entire formation will break with this one weakness. Will the army not be left with nothing?
:::::That's right. It's wavering will.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, it is a sound argument. Alas, the answer requires that only two individuals are involved. "Wavering will" applies to one whole army and is not the right answer.
:::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
:::::Think again?
:::::"Wavering will" is indeed a concept that soldiers need to be rid of, but will this conniving lion accept this perspective? Let's ask another person for their view.
:::::It's better to believe in yourself!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, I have no choice but to reveal the answer. What I'm looking for is: Debt.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' To a debtor, even if his borrowed Balance Coins can purchase an entire city, the money does not legally belong to them. Isn't that being left with nothing?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' The creditor is left with just a debt slip in hand while the money is with the debtor. Who knows if the debtor will repay the money on time? A debt slip is not equivalent to cold hard Balance Coins. Isn't that also being left with nothing?
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not right. Where did the money go?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, does it matter where the money has gone? What's important is that in my theory, as long as the debt remains unsettled, both parties are realistically left with nothing!

::::::{{tx}}
:::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try asking Castorice.
:::::'''Castorice:''' ...From what I have experienced, it is "hatred."
:::::'''Castorice:''' In the battlefields of Era Bellica, I once witnessed many tragic scenes, and countless wars were caused by hatred and vengeance between cities and people.
:::::'''Castorice:''' Refusing to let go of hatred in their hands would only result in... a war that leaves both parties with nothing.
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right. It's hatred that people refuse to let go.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Oh-ho? Hatred? An interesting perspective. Even if it's not what I was thinking, it rivals the original answer...
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Vengeance only begets more vengeance. Fine, I have decided to free your hand. This is but a friendly exchange of answers, ho-ho-ho.
::::::Think again?
::::::You feel that this lion prefers answers off the beaten path. Let's ask someone else's thoughts.
::::::What would Mydei say?
::::::'''Mydei:''' Hmph! More shenanigans from this bunch of trickster lions. Haven't they and their kind given up on torturing others with their despicable riddles?
::::::'''Mydei:''' My answer is... a wavering will. If a warrior's heart wavers even slightly when charging at their enemy, then death would be their only outcome.
::::::'''Mydei:''' Also, if one's will wavers, one's morale will dissipate, and the entire formation will break with this one weakness. Will the army not be left with nothing?
::::::That's right. It's wavering will.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, it is a sound argument. Alas, the answer requires that only two individuals are involved. "Wavering will" applies to one whole army and is not the right answer.
::::::Ouch! This lion's dishing out physical punishment. What a bad teacher...
::::::Think again?
::::::"Wavering will" is indeed a concept that soldiers need to be rid of, but will this conniving lion accept this perspective? Let's ask another person for their view.
::::::It's better to believe in yourself!
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho-ho, I have no choice but to reveal the answer. What I'm looking for is: Debt.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' To a debtor, even if his borrowed Balance Coins can purchase an entire city, the money does not legally belong to them. Isn't that being left with nothing?
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' The creditor is left with just a debt slip in hand while the money is with the debtor. Who knows if the debtor will repay the money on time? A debt slip is not equivalent to cold hard Balance Coins. Isn't that also being left with nothing?
::::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not right. Where did the money go?
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, does it matter where the money has gone? What's important is that in my theory, as long as the debt remains unsettled, both parties are realistically left with nothing!

:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright! Let's do this.
:::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, listen well: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|"Looking adorable, everyone laughing gaily, losing its head at the Entry Hour, recovered at Curtain-Fall Hour"}}.
:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try thinking about it yourself.
::::The Entry Hour and the Curtain-Fall Hour... I remember these respectively represent "dawn" and "sunset" in the Amphoreus calendar. This thing loses its head in the morning, but can retrieve it at night...
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} People going to work.
:::::You recall the countless IPC employees you beat to a pulp along your trailblazing expedition. All of them had a "wise yet restrained" face on them.
:::::That's right. Maybe only after they get off work, go home, and begin scrolling through their phones, will their heads return to them.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho? This... is a very interesting perspective. But I do not accept your answer! I never get off work after all, ho!
:::::...Owie! Then again, you also hit its sore spot. Guess that makes it even?
:::::Professor Owl.
:::::That's right. According to your knowledge, owls tuck their heads into their feathers and sleep the day away, so it looks like they're headless. And their heads only pop out at night. "Taking off at dusk" &mdash; that's what this is referring to.
:::::I don't know how Professor Owl would react if he was described as "adorable"... In any case, it fits the riddle perfectly &mdash; you're a total genius.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho? This answer may make some sense, but it's awfully rude of you to say that the incarnation of wisdom has lost its head! I will punish you in Cerces' name!
:::::That hurt! I forgot that this lion is also a loyal disciple of Cerces...
:::::A pillow.
:::::When people wake up, a pillow would have lost the head that laid on it, and only recover it at night. Also, a fluffy pillow is everyone's favorite, even if it's people's love for sleep that makes it so important.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho? You actually got it right? Ho, ho... I see, ho... Don't think that it makes you smarter than me, got it?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho, dang, you're good...
:::::I'm stumped. Ask someone?
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::Perhaps the answer is something special that only happened in Amphoreus. If that's the case, maybe our new local friends might have an answer?
:::::How about asking Tribbie, Trinnon, and Trianne?
:::::'''Tribbie:''' '''We''' know! This riddle is about {{Rubi|Zagreus| the Trickery Titan}}!
:::::'''Trinnon:''' They got two heads, so it's fine to lose one of them.
:::::'''Trianne:''' That sounds awful! But it's okay. Big Zaggy's a strange fellow &mdash; they won't feel pain even from losing their head!
:::::I see, so it's Zagreus.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, an ingenious perspective, but still not an answer &mdash; no one knows if Zagreus' two heads are even real. It could be a visage of trickery. Their heads could be inside their belly for all we know!
:::::Yowch! This lion looks like most of its fangs are gone, but its bite hurts more than usual...
:::::Think again?
:::::We'll use the girls' answer as backup for now. Let's think of other possibilities.
:::::Phainon, help me.
:::::'''Phainon:''' To lose one's head, only to retrieve it. Is it resurrection...?
:::::'''Phainon:''' Among the people I know, Mydei's the only one who has abilities that even come close to this. His immortality is known to all, and he is also beloved by the Kremnos clansmen.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho, hohoho... Lord Mydei definitely can rise from the dead, but as for the "adorable" part... hohohoho...
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' It's been a long time since my jaws have hurt from laughing... Lord Phainon, you may have gotten it wrong, but I won't bite you. Please don't mention this to Lord Mydei, or I fear he'll pound me to dust!
:::::'''Phainon:''' Heh heh, don't worry. He's not that kind of person at all.
:::::Still trying to figure out the correct answer, Phainon departs with his head bowed...
:::::Titans help those who help themselves!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho, allow me to reveal the right answer then! It is... a pillow!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Think about it. People wake up at the Entry Hour, and their heads leave the pillow. Doesn't that mean the pillow's lost its head? And going to sleep at the Curtain-Fall Hour, doesn't that mean a pillow has found its head once more?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' The difficult part of this question is that I never said it had to be the entity's own head! How was it, eh? Eh? Are you tickled?
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This lion is very similar to Shush.
::::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho-ho? Warrior from outlands, you know a genius whose wit is comparable to mine? Ho... If not for the fact that I can't leave this wall, I would've run off to befriend this luminary!
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if the person doesn't go home on that day?

:::{{tx}}
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Try thinking about it yourself.
::::This lion's asked a weird question... Could it be some brain-teasing trickery?
::::'''(Trailblazer):''' The answer is...
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Coincidence.
:::::That's right. A minor coincidence will put smiles on people's faces, but if it reaches an impossibly outrageous magnitude, everyone will think that something went wrong somewhere...
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Very good. Alas, there are both good and bad coincidences. If {{Rubi|Zagreus|Trickery Titan}} is pulling the strings behind the scenes, the outcome would be unpleasantly un-cute with a surge of bad luck. Wrong answer!
:::::It hurts so bad! Why can't the lion's maw coincidentally malfunction...
:::::All animals.
:::::From your limited pet-keeping experiences, any animal is super cute when it's young and small, but it undergoes extreme changes when grown, to the point where you can't even recognize it sometimes.
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho, a classic angle. But how do you explain instances where humans may be mischievous when young, but turn out to be exemplars when they're all grown up? Your answer is too poorly thought-out and therefore unacceptable!
:::::Painful! You're sure this lion was never cute in its youth...
:::::Better ask someone else!
:::::Ask for help with the teleslate.
:::::Still stuck? You just happen to know some new friends who're perfect for this question...
:::::I wonder if Tribbie is free?
:::::'''Tribbie:''' You need to... put your hand in for the answer. But, '''we''' can't reach it!
:::::'''Tribbie:''' '''We''' can stack, but it's dangerous. It's so tall, even taller than Snowy and De... Perhaps plenty of folks in the city also can't reach it? Looks like no one will be able to put their hand in other than Grand Craftsman!
:::::'''Tribbie:''' A lion that can't bite a hand can only simmer in rage!
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Boohoo, please stop it, Lady Tribbie. It was never my choice to be stuck at this height. It was some second-rate craftsman who made me this way!

:::::'''Mydei:''' What I want to know is... why you're asking me such a question?

:::::Your thinking is very unusual.
:::::'''Mydei:''' ...You just want to see me smash this lion, don't you?
:::::'''Mydei:''' Forget it. I'll give you the answer. It is... "a person's character." People of unique character will be most welcome, but if they go overboard and cause trouble, that would incur the wrath of many.
:::::'''Mydei:''' It is even more so on the battlefield. Castrum Kremnos' military code was established to instil order. Satisfied, lion?
:::::'''Verax Leo:''' Ho? An answer that fits Lord Mydei's character indeed. It may differ from the standard answer, but since you answered in person, I will show you some respect and dispense with the biting!
