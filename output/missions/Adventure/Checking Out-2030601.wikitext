;(Talk to Dennis)
:{{tx}}
:'''Dennis:''' Greetings, esteemed guest. How may I assist you today?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know who I am?
:'''Dennis:''' Err... If I'm not wrong, you should be {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer) of the Astral Express, yes?
:'''Dennis:''' How can I help you, {{MC|f=miss|m=sir}}?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll ask you again: Do you know who '''I''' am?
::'''Dennis:''' Err... Do you have any issues with the hotel's services?
::'''Dennis:''' If that is the case, please call The Reverie's dedicated complaint hotline...
::My status is much more than that now!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My status is much more than that now!
:'''Dennis:''' Err... You like riddles, is that right?
:'''Dennis:''' There are crossword puzzles in every issue of the ''Diving into Dreamland'' magazine in your guest room. You can try those out if you wish to kill some time...
:'''Dennis:''' Um, if you have nothing else urgent for me, I have to get back to work...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm going to be the lobby manager right now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I will straighten out Penacony's workplace!
:'''Dennis:''' ...
:'''Dennis:''' Err... I'm not sure I get what you mean, {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)... Would you mind elaborating on that a little?
:You tell Dennis that the Astral Express is about to become a stakeholder of Penacony, and embellish the truth "a teensy-weensy bit" &mdash; such as adding a zero behind the five percent...
:And then, you express your fervent wish to replace Dennis as the lobby manager and experience his job for yourself.
:'''Dennis:''' ...
:'''Dennis:''' {{MC|f=Madam|m=Sir}}, let's first put aside whether your statement is true... But even if the Astral Express has a stake in the organization and you represent that faction, it doesn't mean that you can...
:'''???:''' Ohoho... I think that's not a bad idea at all!
:'''Dennis:''' M&mdash;Mr. Alfalfa! What are you doing here?
:'''Old Oti:''' Ohohoho! Since the Oak Family Head is absent, I have to meet with more people as an "up-and-coming talent."
:'''Old Oti:''' I never thought I'd see such a scene as soon as I arrive, but I think it's all right! If this {{MC|f=lady|m=gentleman}} is one of the Nameless, that means they'll also be one of our longstanding partners with the Penacony Conglomerate!
:'''Old Oti:''' Experiencing an employee's life &mdash; if a business partner who brings up such a little request, this old man can still grant it! Ohhohoho!
:'''Dennis:''' But, Mr. Alfalfa...
:'''Old Oti:''' Young one, don't worry! Just look around you &mdash; with such a major disaster befalling Penacony, how many new guests would dare stay in our hotel? To have a Nameless become our lobby manager... isn't that the best kind of marketing The Family desires right now?
:'''Old Oti:''' Discover opportunities and invest in them &mdash; that's just common sense! Such basic business acumen is what the Iris Family lacks the most, if you ask me! Young one, look and learn!
:'''Dennis:''' Err... Yes, you're right, Mr. Alfalfa.
:'''Old Oti:''' That's the right attitude! Ohhohoho... Esteemed guest, how may I address you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just call me Boss Baseballer.
::'''Old Oti:''' Boss Baseballer! It's an honor.
::Just call me Boss Gray.
::'''Old Oti:''' Boss Gray! I've heard so much about you!
::I am {{MC|f=Dame|m=Sir}} (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just call me Boss Gray.
::'''Old Oti:''' Boss Gray! I've heard so much about you!
::I am {{MC|f=Dame|m=Sir}} (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I am {{MC|f=Dame|m=Sir}} (Trailblazer).
:'''Old Oti:''' {{MC|f=Dame|m=Sir}} (Trailblazer)! A most enlightening name!
:'''Old Oti:''' I hereby announce that for the next ten system hours, you are The Reverie's one and only Lobby Manager!
:'''Old Oti:''' Just speak out if you require any support in your work! I will dispatch all staff working in the hotel in reality to coordinate with you, ohhohoho!
:Old Oti lets loose his trademark laughter, and departs the hotel lobby...
:'''Dennis:''' ...
:'''Dennis:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't fret, you haven't been fired!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you doing?
:'''Dennis:''' ...
:'''Dennis:''' ...Hahaha! I've certainly lived to see everything now! Who'd have thought I would experience such good luck in my life?
:'''Dennis:''' You're a magnanimous person, my Nameless friend! In all my years of work, this is the first time I've seen someone voluntarily wanting to work more!
:'''Dennis:''' Now then, I'll leave the work here to you. Truth be told, I have other unattended duties in the Golden Hour...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait a min...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...What about the handover procedure!?
:'''Dennis:''' ..Eh? Handover? What handover?

===Deactivate all the pesky automated service terminals{{subst:void|<!--203060104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|You are now the interim lobby manager of the Reverie.<br />However, those pesky automated service terminals are encroaching upon your role as long as they're operating. You need to deactivate them all.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Unused &mdash; EnterArea_G140)
:Standing before you is a Reverie Hotel's standard-issue automated service terminal.
::To a guest, its one-stop-shop services of checking in, checking out, and navigation service make it a perfect tool of convenience. But to you, it is a monstrous machine that has robbed countless job opportunities from aspiring youths, completely rending the service industry of glorious human touch.
::More importantly, it threatens your place as a lobby manager &mdash; it renders your presence and existence redundant.
::You will not allow such a thing to happen. Your pride as the lobby manager will not be usurped by a cold, ugly machine.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Smash it to smithereens!
:::"Smash it to smithereens!" Your baseball bat whispers to you, and your hand snakes toward your waist...
:::Kick out its power supply.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Kick out its power supply.
::Really? You're just going to remove its power supply? You sure this is "trailblazing" enough?
::"Smash it to smithereens!" Your baseball bat strapped on your waist whispers to you, and you reach for it...
::...On second thought, this automated service terminal is hotel property. It belongs to the Penacony Conglomerate &mdash; in other words, it also belongs to you, a major stakeholder...
::...That was close. You almost let your impulsive instincts get the better of you. Good thing your love for money kept your destructive tendencies in check. You think you hear the baseball bat at your waist sigh in resignation.
::"Sorry to disappoint you, old friend," you lament in your heart. "Don't worry. There'll be plenty of other opportunities to flaunt your power..."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Kick out the terminal's power supply.
::*thud* You dislodge the power supply plug with a swift kick, dealing vengeance for the Paperfold University's hospitality graduates whose bright futures were stolen away.
::{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dismiss all the remaining staff members at the reception desk{{subst:void|<!--203060105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=The Reverie (Reality)|update|You are now the interim lobby manager of the Reverie.<br />Even so, you still have several colleagues at the reception desk who might potentially share your work and undermine your influence. Perhaps it would be best to grant them a vacation and handle all reception duties on your own.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Confused Receptionist)
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' Mmm... hello?
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' May I ask... Did you just unplug the automated service terminal?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Proudly) Yes, that's me!
::'''Confused Receptionist:''' Er... Are you okay? If you want, I can call a nurse for you...
::(Calmly) Yes, that's me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Calmly) Yes, that's me.
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' Er... Okay, that's fine. As long as you're happy. We'll just plug it back in later.
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' Did someone put something in the water today!? It's just one weird thing after the next...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What other weird things have been happening?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Weird things are right in my wheelhouse. I'm all ears.
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' ...Strange. Didn't you see it, too?
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' Dennis the manager &mdash; who knows what he's dealing with upstairs, but he stormed out screaming things like "vacation" and "tokens"... It was so weird. I've never seen him like that before!
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' I heard about something going down in the Dreamscape, but it's a work day so, y'know... Our lobby manager is MIA, too. What are we supposed to do?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm in charge of things around here now...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...I'll give you the day off!
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' ...Huh? For real?
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' I take it all back, then. Today isn't a weird day &mdash; today's a miraculous day!
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' Then, I'll leave all the reception work with you... Shouldn't be too difficult, right? Seeing as Old Oti personally assented to this one, I can't get blamed if anything goes wrong, can I?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hang on! I still need you to help me with a favor.
:'''Confused Receptionist:''' ...Huh?

{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Anderson)
:{{tx}}
:'''Anderson:''' Greetings, {{MC|f=beautiful lady|m=handsome sir}}. What would you like today?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll take '''one dozen''' SoulGlad.
:'''Anderson:''' Er... sorry about that, {{MC|f=madam|m=sir}}. You should be able to work out that we're a hotel bar, not a supermarket...
:'''Anderson:''' If you want, you can go to the lobby manager at the hotel reception to order a full box from the concierge...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I AM the lobby manager!
::'''Anderson:''' Er, I guess I don't really understand what's going on then, {{MC|f=madam|m=sir}}...
::You're standing in front of nothing but SoulGlad.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're standing in front of nothing but SoulGlad.
:'''Anderson:''' Er, well that's because... This is really hard to explain, {{MC|f=madam|m=sir}}...

::'''Royroy:''' Of course! Royroy Bougiebooga Baden-Powell.
::With unprecedented levels of restraint and first-rate professionalism, you fight back the urge to laugh out loud at this Pepeshi &mdash; who apparently has no idea how silly his name sounds.
::Alright, Royroy Bougiebooga Baden...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alright, Royroy Bougiebooga Baden...
:'''Royroy:''' ...Baden-Powell, that's right!
:It's clear to you that this Pepeshi has no idea how funny his name sounds. It's rude to just laugh at someone's name &mdash; and so you decide to just do so quietly in your head. How kind!
:'''(Trailblazer):''' Hang on a minute. Let me check the system...
:...There never was any "system" in the first place. And even if there was, Dennis has never told you how to operate it.
:Fortunately, Penacony has just been through a disaster. You '''guess''' that The Reverie Hotel should have a few empty rooms now...
:'''Royroy:''' Er... {{MC|f=Madam|m=Sir}}? Did you just say that you'd like to check the system?
:Questions arise from the guest, as expected. Weaponless, you are armed only with your quick wits and a sharp tongue &mdash; take them on, soldier!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good news! There are plenty of vacancies right now!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Good news! You picked the perfect time to stay, because it's the off season and The Reverie Hotel has plenty of vacancies.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' You booked an economy room to begin with, but we are now able to upgrade you to a Deluxe Suite, an Executive Suite, or a Comfort Suite &mdash; free of charge!
::'''Royroy:''' Really!? That's amazing! Uncle Oti's the man!
::...Did he just mention '''Uncle Oti'''?
::All of a sudden, the name Royroy Bougiebooga Baden-Powell doesn't sound so funny to you anymore. Sure enough, having a rich relative is the best cosmetic out there.
::Bad news! Your booking has been canceled.
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Bad news, Mr. Baden-Powell... There's no record of you in the system. I'm afraid your booking has been canceled.
::'''Royroy:''' ...Huh!? But how is that possible?
::'''Royroy:''' No... no way! Uncle Oti personally confirmed that with me. Why don't I give him a buzz...
::...Rats! You were finally experiencing the joys of abusing your authority, but you had to go and pick on the nephew of the Alfalfa family head. Now it's time to test your ability to think on your feet, boss...
::I ran another quick check...
::...And it seems I was wrong.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Say any random room number)
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Your room number is... 13588, the Platinum Suite!
::'''(Trailblazer):''' Please take the elevator up to the 135th floor... our staff will be waiting to meet you there.

:'''Boothill:''' Fork me, you can't just...
:'''Argenti:''' So, I decided to team up with him for now and put my efforts toward realizing his unaccomplished noble pursuit.
:'''Boothill:''' ...Could you pipe down? For fork's sake...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What does "noble pursuit" mean?

::'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' I&mdash;Is that so? S&mdash;Sorry, your place is so grand, I got confused!
::The panic in the Pepeshi's voice instantly makes you feel guilty &mdash; sure, you might look vain, but you're still a softie deep down...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just kidding. This is the hotel reception.
::'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Ah... I&mdash;I get it. You... you're funny...
::Correct. You've come to the right place.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Correct. You've come to the right place.
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' G&mdash;Great. Looks like I&mdash;I've come to the right place...
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' So... I&mdash;I'm looking for a friend who once stayed here. Would you be able to help me out?
:Finding friends &mdash; another completely new kind of gig. Fudge it, this is your first day on the job. Why are you running into all this other trouble?
:Based on your limited understanding, among most civilizations &mdash; for the personal safety of the guest and their property &mdash; if you want to find someone at a hotel, it's customary to show a valid form of ID.
:Unfortunately, you don't know how The Reverie normally handles this kind of appeal... However, you wish to maintain your professional image, so you ask...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The person you're looking for... what's the room number?
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Uh, p&mdash;please hold up and let me see...
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Memo memo memo... ah-ha &mdash; there it is! It's the 135th... it's room number 13527.
:The 135th floor? That's probably just a coincidence... You should ask him the name of the person he's looking for, just in case.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The person you're looking for... what's their name?
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' My friend's name is, R&mdash; er, hang on a sec. Where did I put that memo...
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Ah, found it! *ahem* His name is Royroy... Bougiebooga... Baden-Powell.
:Him! You feel relieved &mdash; this is going to make things easier.
:Also, you admire the professionalism of your coworker up there on the 135th floor. They have helped Mr. Royroy complete his check-in without disrupting the flow of your work.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go find your friend!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let me see some ID, please.
::'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' ...Huh? D&mdash;Do I need an ID to get in here?
::'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Ooh... s&mdash;sorry, {{MC|f=madam|m=sir}}. I ain't never been to such a high-class place before in my life. I didn't know you had all these rules...
::The Pepeshi shoots a pitiful look, and a sparkling liquid gleam begins to swirl around inside his eyes...
::...The second-hardest thing in the universe for you to endure is to watch a Pepeshi weeping... second only to the heartbreak of watching a young silver-haired girl turn into bubbles before you. You decide to give him a freebie...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Forget it. Go on up.
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' Thank you... thank you very much!
:'''Cowardly Pepeshi:''' S&mdash;So I'll go up, then...
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (So Penacony has guests of that caliber, too... I thought everyone who could afford to come here was either filthy rich or an aristocrat.)

::'''Numby:''' ...Oink?
::'''Topaz:''' Ah, it's you, (Trailblazer)! We were just talking about you a moment ago. What a coincidence!
::'''Aventurine:''' Haven't seen you around for a while, friend. You've been busy in my absence.
::'''Aventurine:''' First, saving Penacony. Then, resolving the crisis aboard the Radiant Feldspar &mdash; even though it was a false alarm &mdash; and how is it that you're carrying the title of lobby manager now? Are you so short of money that you have to work two jobs?
::'''Topaz:''' Oh... Are you tired from so much travel, and you want to experience what it's like keeping office hours? Why didn't you say so... The Strategic Investment Department is recruiting at the moment. How about I give you a project manager role?
::'''Topaz:''' With your credentials, P25... No, P30 at least, posted straight to Pier Point HQ. Meals, accommodation, and travel expenses are all reimbursed &mdash; how about it?
::(Ask Topaz) What's the base salary?
::'''Topaz:''' I didn't expect that. Are you really interested?
::'''Topaz:''' Your salary and bonuses are no big deal. We can talk about those... But really, Shouldn't you go ask Miss Himeko what she thinks? It will not be worth the trouble if poaching harms an important relationship of ours~
::(Ask Aventurine) You're recovering pretty fast.
::'''Aventurine:''' Thanks for the concern. The fact that I'm standing here and talking to you is all thanks to that red-headed Knight of Beauty coming to my rescue.
::'''Aventurine:''' I'd never met a real knight before, and if I just listened to the rumors, I'd think they were just a bunch of sensationalist weirdos. Turns out, seeing is believing &mdash; right?

::...And as expected, you completely fail. You watch on helplessly as this battle unfolds before your eyes...
::'''Topaz:''' Trying to stir me up with your usual tricks, huh? Let's see. Even if I count all the gains from Penacony under your name, your success rate would still be several percent points behind mine.
::'''Aventurine:''' Awww, come on. That's looking at quantity over quality. I never expected the beautiful and kind-hearted Director Topaz to resort to distorting concepts like that. Look deep into your heart, will you? You ought to know better than anyone else how difficult the projects I take on are.
::'''Topaz:''' Then I really should sing your praises. Remember that time you sent me an Epsilon stock exchange market analysis? "The Epsilon Stock Index is expected to bounce back strongly after bottoming out, and investors are advised to seize this opportunity and immediately take positions"...
::'''Topaz:''' ...But guess what? Just after markets opened the next day, the Epsilon Index went below 28 million points... {{Size|28|28 million &mdash; the lowest in its recorded history!}}
::'''Aventurine:''' Are we going to start digging up old scores now? I was just being kind and hoped that everyone can make a little money together... How can an accident as rare as that be blamed on me?
::'''Aventurine:''' Besides, haven't we already done a retro on that? My source was your old friend at the Epsilon Star Exchange. Who knew that you could work in stocks your whole life, and still be incompetent like that?
::'''Topaz:''' Hmph, any reason why you're not bringing up your undefeated "luck" in this case? Your standards sure are flexible, Director Aventurine~
::The idea that top execs in the Strategic Investment Department can also get caught up in the chaos of the stock market... it leaves you feeling a little more balanced inside.
::'''Numby:''' Oink... Oink...
::'''Jade:''' Oh my, I could hear you two fighting from miles away...
::'''Jade:''' ...These two kids are such good friends.
::'''Topaz:''' ...*ahem* My humble apologies, Madam Jade. (Trailblazer) is an old friend of ours, so we acted a little too familiar before them... Director Aventurine, next time you want to pick a fight, please mind the time and the place.
::'''Aventurine:''' Hmph, right back at you.
::'''Topaz:''' I nearly forgot &mdash; we'd like to check out. (Trailblazer). Here's my room card...
::'''Aventurine:''' ...Hang on, why are you going first? If I remember correctly, it was me who got here first. Has everyone forgotten the principle of "first come, first served"?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (He still really cares about cutting in the queue...)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Keep watching the drama.)
::'''Topaz:''' Looks like you've really made a full recovery then? That's a pity~
::'''Aventurine:''' Arguing with you is a part of my rehab as well, Director Topaz~
::'''Jade:''' Hehe... They are top elites of the IPC in public, but just two hot-headed kids in private.
::'''Jade:''' Give me your room cards, Aventurine, Topaz.
::Jade gives you the three room cards...
::Under the three Stonehearts' guidance, you successfully help them check out.
::'''Aventurine:''' Never thought checking out would take so long... I have to think about taking my previous offer off the table.
::'''Jade:''' Don't make fun of (Trailblazer), Aventurine. The Astral Express is now a shareholder in the Penacony Conglomerate just like the IPC, so you can consider us equal partners.
::'''Jade:''' Ah... Since we're business partners then, why don't we snap a souvenir photo? Just think of it as... an informal gathering between group reps?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Good idea.
:::'''Topaz:''' Agreed. After all, it's not easy for all of us to meet up like this.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Isn't my wardrobe a little shabby...?
:::'''Topaz:''' That's called "leaning into your style." You're so photogenic, you don't have to worry about details like that.

;(Talk to Dancy)
:'''Dancy:''' ...Stop disturbing me! Can't you see I'm in the middle of a game? Just get out of...
:'''Dancy:''' ...Ooooh! It's you, {{MC|f=Miss|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)! I'm so sorry! I was so absorbed in the game that I didn't realize it was you.
:'''Dancy:''' You... I mean... you're not here to get me back to work, right? Look, I've got a winning streak going on here, and I'm sure a thoughtful and caring {{MC|f=lady|m=gentleman}} like you wouldn't want to interrupt it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wouldn't, but maybe Old Oti would.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sure, let's just leave the reception desk unattended.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it worth losing your job?
:'''Dancy:''' H&mdash;hey! I was just messing around! Don't take it so seriously! We can't leave the lobby unattended. I bet the complaint line at the reception desk is blowing up...
:'''Dancy:''' Well, I'll pack up and return to reality...
:'''Novice Player:''' Hey! Hold on! What are we supposed to do if you leave?
:'''Engrossed Player:''' Exactly! You know the saying, right? "Bounce from the game, bad luck be your fate!"
:'''Dancy:''' ...Who are you trying to fool? You only learned this game a couple of system hours ago! And you just looked up that line, didn't you? Don't try to bluff me with that!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Celestial Jade popular in Penacony?
::'''Dancy:''' It's not like it's all the rage, but it's definitely something novel! Thanks to that young lady who came all the way from the Xianzhou! She introduced us to this fun game!
::Who taught you this game?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who taught you this game?
:'''Dancy:''' Oh, it was just pure luck! Right after I dived into the Dreamscape, I met a young lady proficient in the game from the distant Xianzhou. She highly recommended this game called "Celestial Jade," and we got hooked right away.
:'''Lucky Novice Player:''' I don't care! I'm not done having fun yet! If you're leaving, ask {{MC|f=her|m=him}} to stay and play with us!
:'''Dancy:''' Um... what do you think, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer)? It's terrible to have one player short for this 4-player game. Since you're so understanding...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But I don't know the rules.
::'''Lucky Novice Player:''' Don't worry! It's super easy, you'll pick it up in no time.
::'''Engrossed Player:''' Yeah, just come over and take a seat! That "Dandy" guy can leave now!
::'''Novice Player:''' Heehee, we'll make sure you have a great time, novice...
::Just bring it on! I ain't scared!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just bring it on! I ain't scared!
:'''Lucky Novice Player:''' Great! That's the attitude!
:'''Engrossed Player:''' Awesome! Just come over and take a seat! That "Dandy" guy can leave now!
:'''Novice Player:''' Heehee, we'll make sure you have a great time, novice...
:'''Dancy:''' Well... I guess I should get back to work then. Have fun and enjoy yourselves...
