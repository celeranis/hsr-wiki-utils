:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a screwed-up twist of fate...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do I see you everywhere?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Long time no see, Mr. Giovanni.
:::'''Giovanni:''' Haha, wherever there is laughter, there {{Rubi|I|Fools}} will be. Besides, I invested in a project here in Penacony, so I wanted to check in on how it was doing.
:::'''Giovanni:''' ...A brand-new game, {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''Legend of the Galactic Baseballer''}}! How about it, are you keen?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Tell me more details.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds kinda sus...
::::'''Giovanni:''' My friend, caution is a good thing &mdash; but it can also make you miss out on a whole lot of fun!
::::Now why does that name sound familiar...
::::'''Giovanni:''' Don't worry, my dear friend &mdash; I'll fill you in nice and slow.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now why does that name sound familiar...
::::'''Giovanni:''' Don't worry, my dear friend &mdash; I'll fill you in nice and slow.
:::'''Giovanni:''' This is the new project that I'm sponsoring in Penacony, and it's a different game from Aetherium Wars. We use the unique Dreamscape tech of Penacony to create a completely immersive experience &mdash; and of course, you don't even need friends to play it. It's a single-player game!
:::'''Giovanni:''' The open beta is out now. How about it, wanna try out this new gameplay?
:::'''Giovanni:''' Good evening, {{MC|m=dashing sir|f=lovely miss}}. I've heard so much about the Astral Express but never imagined meeting you in this little Dreamscape here...
:::'''Giovanni:''' Please allow me to introduce myself first: My humble name is Giovanni di Giorgio da Epsilon, and I'm a tiny private trader from Epsilon.
:::'''Giovanni:''' Unless I'm mistaken, you're here to try out {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|''Legend of the Galactic Baseballer''}}, right?
:::''Legend of the Galactic Baseballer''?
:::'''Giovanni:''' That's right!
:::Sounds kinda sus...
:::'''Giovanni:''' My friend, caution is a good thing &mdash; but it can also make you miss out on a whole lot of fun!
:::Now why does that name sound familiar...
:::'''Giovanni:''' Don't worry, my dear friend &mdash; I'll fill you in nice and slow.

:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ''Legend of the Galactic Baseballer''?

::'''Giovanni:''' The open beta is out now. How about it, wanna try out the experience?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm down to play!
:::'''Giovanni:''' Fantastic! Right now, ''Legend of the Galactic Baseballer'' is still under development, and we need more testing to get more user feedback and suggestions.
:::No, I have a bone to pick with you.
:::Someone plagiarized my name!
:::Using my name is one thing, but not giving me compensation!?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, I have a bone to pick with you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Someone plagiarized my name!
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Using my name is one thing, but not giving me compensation!?
::'''Giovanni:''' About that... we haven't been able to find any registration for {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Galactic Baseballer}} in either Epsilon's copyright protection ordinances or in the Penacony registry of IP.
::'''Giovanni:''' Also, we prefer an alternative term: Something like a flattering '''homage'''.
::'''Giovanni:''' If the famed Galactic Baseballer is willing to personally participate in the test, I would be delighted to prepare a gift for you.
::'''Giovanni:''' What say you, {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}} Baseballer?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm all ears.
::'''Giovanni:''' No problem! Please ask me anything. Which part would you like me to begin with?
::{{tx}}
:'''Giovanni:''' Mmm? Any more questions?
;(All choices lead to the following options)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Where do I play the game?
::'''Giovanni:''' Great question! We tried developing it on a dream bubble supplied by a sponsor, but... *sigh* the content on that dream bubble was a little bit too exciting to be made available to the public.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What kind of game is this?
::'''Giovanni:''' Let's see... How did we put it in the tagline...
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Is there any remuneration for helping out with testing?
::'''Giovanni:''' Of course! Test rewards will gradually unlock as you progress through the game.
::{{tx}}
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's all the questions I have.
::'''Giovanni:''' Alright, well, a picture paints a thousand words. I can talk all day, or you can experience it for yourself.
::{{tx}}

:{{tx}}
:'''Giovanni:''' The testing has finished. How'd you find it? How was the experience?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's it?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I kinda want more...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Terrible! I want a refund!
:'''Giovanni:''' Haha, I'll pass that feedback to the devs exactly as it is.
:'''Giovanni:''' I have to ask the participants of the first test a few routine questions &mdash; it's also to collect feedback on the game's user experience.
:'''Giovanni:''' Question one: Did you have fun?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was fun! And I want to play more!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's mid, and a little uninspired.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Trashcans are more interesting than this.
:'''Giovanni:''' Next up is question two: As a player, would you be willing to pay for this game?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd snatch it up!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't have any money...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No worries. I'll get the money. Somehow.
:'''Giovanni:''' Oh... is that so?
:'''Giovanni:''' And the final question. I'm really curious about your answer to this one:
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Select the golden bat and become the top baseballer in the universe...
::You tell an inspiring story of aspiration.
::"The golden bat bestows unto you unparalleled powers, and everyone in the universe comes to know the name of the Galactic Baseballer, which becomes the most unrivaled figure across the universe. Your home planet erects a huge sculpture in your name as it pries money out of eager tourists' wallets. However, since you failed to register the copyright, you can only watch as the coins flow away into other people's pockets..."
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (...Sounds like this turned into a realistic tragedy somewhere along the way.)
::'''Giovanni:''' Combined with what happens to the Galactic Baseballer... it's a real educational ending. Haha, I'll add this outcome into consideration.
::Pick the dark bat and become the greatest villain in all the cosmos...
::You tell a thought-provoking fable.
::"As the dragonslayer eventually devolves into a dragon, so too does the Galactic Baseballer succumb when they touch upon the forbidden powers. By the time you realize what is happening, there is no longer any path to forgiveness. You cover up your face and seal yourself away in a dark corner of the universe with your dark bat, waiting for the next piteous adventurer who is driven mad by desire to turn up..."
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (...But would any players actually choose the obviously wrong "dark bat" as an option?)
::'''Giovanni:''' Hmm... what a fascinating ending. I'll consider it.
::Pick your own bat, and become a righteous person...
::You tell an ordinary but heartwarming story.
::"Giving up all temptation, you pick up the bat you're most familiar with. It's worn and dull, but it holds the truest powers when it rests in your hands. You have not become the ultimate baseballer in the cosmos, but whenever trouble befalls anyone, there will always be a kind-hearted individual arriving to help out with this bat in hand..."
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (...A cosmic altruist. Maybe it's for the best if they're someone ordinary.)
::'''Giovanni:''' Mmm... a rather innovative ending, and I'll consider using it.
::Spurn arms and take up the pen: Become the literary hero of the cosmos!
::You tell a marvelous story about finding another way.
::"As you gaze at the three bats in front of you, a thought flashes into your skull like lightning: The Galactic Baseballer cannot save everyone! To save the universe from its own ignorance, you decide to throw down your weapon and set foot on a new battlefield: That of the cosmos's literary hero!"
::'''(Trailblazer):''' (...Speaking of which, can raccoons even write?)
::'''Giovanni:''' Haha, fantastic! How "Elating"! That's my ending!
::I wouldn't design it like this at the start.

:'''Giovanni:''' Haha, very constructive criticism! I'll consider it.
:'''Giovanni:''' It's getting late and I have to get this feedback back to the developers for them to run their changes.
:'''Giovanni:''' I hope they can get things done before project delivery. Y'know, the other sponsors aren't nearly as nice as I am.
:'''Giovanni:''' Before you go &mdash; take this. It's a bonus present especially for the Galactic Baseballer!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh wow, I'm sooo "Elated" now...
:'''Giovanni:''' Haha, thanks for the compliment. That's the best praise ever for {{Rubi|us|Fools}}.
