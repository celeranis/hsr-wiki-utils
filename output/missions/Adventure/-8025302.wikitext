;(Talk to Courier)
:'''Courier:''' Hello, (Trailblazer). There's a package for you. Please sign here.
:Package? You didn't buy anything recently... Your brain starts to whirl in overdrive as you look at the big arcade machine in front of you.

:'''Courier:''' That's a business secret, {{MC|f=ma'am|m=sir}}.
