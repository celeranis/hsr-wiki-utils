{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|The Realm-Keeping Commission received reports that anomalies resembling cloudhymn magic have been spotted in the Alchemy Commission delve, and that invisible monsters were encountered within this phenomenon.<br />Based on the patterns of anomalies, Guangjin has prepared bait on the beach in hopes of uncovering the true source behind the phenomenon.}}

;(Talk to Guangjin)
:'''Guangjin:''' We've made it to the site where the anomaly hit. All the monsters in this area are under the influence of the Cloudhymn Magic and are invisible.
:'''Guangjin:''' The Realm-Keeping Commission believes that the culprit for this anomaly is hiding here somewhere.
:'''Guangjin:''' The {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Reverberation Generator}} should help locate invisible monsters. Please use it wisely.
:'''Guangjin:''' I'll be investigating the other direction next. Please help me check out the beach, (Trailblazer).
:'''Guangjin:''' Be careful. We'll stay in remote contact, and I'll catch up with you later.

;(Talk to Guangjin)
:'''Guangjin:''' Looks like I'm too late. The anomaly has disappeared.
:'''Guangjin:''' But at least we've figured out something. Turns out those Warp Trotters are the ones behind the anomaly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Can Trotters use cloudhymn magic?
::'''Guangjin:''' I don't think so. It would be better to say they've somehow learned to imitate cloudhymn magic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...As for how they caused the anomaly, it's still a mystery.
::'''Guangjin:''' After all, we don't know much about these dimension-leaping creatures.
::'''Guangjin:''' My best guess is that maybe they've somehow imitated cloudhymn magic.
:'''Guangjin:''' Anyway, we've made progress in the investigation. Thanks to your discoveries, the Realm-Keeping Commission will be looking into those Warp Trotters next.
:'''Guangjin:''' Meet me at the Alchemy Commission if you're willing to help us all the way through. But for now, please take this reward as a token of our appreciation for all your assistance. We should be heading back.
