:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Go on. I imagine you want help with something?
::'''Old Bai:''' See, look how smart they are. They don't trip over their words like someone I know. Where's that usual spirit of yours gone?
::'''Renke:''' It's not like I can ask someone for help like I'm kicking back and catching up with a friend, is it?
::'''Old Bai:''' I shall not deceive you. We do indeed have something we'd like to ask of you. I hear the Nameless of the Astral Express are always happy to help others?
::'''Renke:''' I thought you said if the Nameless were up to no good, they'd never be found out. Or even if they were, the higher-ups would never hold them responsible?
::'''Old Bai:''' No! Why do you keep trying to make us look bad?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't I give you a moment to get on the same page?
:::'''Old Bai:''' Brother, shut your mouth for just a second... Alright, now we're on the same page.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's be honest. You're up to no good, aren't you?
:::'''Old Bai:''' Don't listen to him. We're do-gooders!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How long are you planning on talking? I'll grab a chair.
:::'''Old Bai:''' Alright, I'll make it quick.
::'''Old Bai:''' Ahem, first, please allow us to introduce ourselves. This gentleman here is Master Renke. Before he retired, he was a Cloud Knight drillmaster who led a starskiff formation to undergo marshal inspection. Although now, he is no more than a babbling cycrane operator.
::'''Old Bai:''' As for myself, I am a wise and low-profile Artisanship Commission engineer. I actually collaborated on the design of a number of parts inside the firepower systems of the Skysplitter you stand upon now. However, I am now also retired, like the ship itself.
::'''Old Bai:''' Ever since its retirement, it has become a venue for all sorts of competitions and flourished in its new role. Seeing myself as a father to this ship, I admire it greatly, but I am also conflicted... What is to be done about those cannons? Did we not say: "The more the better, the bigger the more beautiful?"
::'''Renke:''' They are merely left there to gather dust.
::'''Old Bai:''' Leaving so many cannons unused is just a waste of resources! Even if you don't use live ammunition, just firing off a salute and hearing them roar would do!
::'''Renke:''' Heh, but guess what? They wouldn't let us.
::'''Old Bai:''' So, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}, we wanted you to help us with a little favor.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I give you permission. You are allowed to fire your cannons on the Skysplitter!
:::'''Old Bai:''' Your permission doesn't mean anything. What I'm asking, is that you go and fire the cannons for us!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're not asking me to go and fire these cannons just so you can listen to them?
:::'''Old Bai:''' I knew you'd get it, youngster! That's exactly what I hoped.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd like to hear what Master Renke wants from me, first...
:::'''Old Bai:''' No! First come, first served. You have to do what I want first.
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've always wanted to fire those cannons!
:::'''Old Bai:''' See, Renke? I told you they were our savior!
:::'''Renke:''' I reckon {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}} could actually handle it!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This won't cause any trouble, will it?
:::'''Old Bai:''' What trouble could it cause?
:::'''Renke:''' If it isn't going to cause trouble, why don't you do it yourself?
::'''Old Bai:''' Take this. I've written a program into this jade abacus. You just need to insert it into the Skysplitter system and the program will immediately take control of the cannon systems and set off a 21-gun salute in a set order. It'll be a real blast!
::{{tx}}
::{{DIcon|Talk}} No one's going to get blown up, are they?
:::'''Old Bai:''' Relax, the amazing thing about this "Wardance 21-Gun Salute" is that they can still roar out without even being loaded!
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} They're just going to let me fire them?
:::'''Old Bai:''' As long as you pretend you're working, the people in the control room will selectively ignore you.
:::{{tx}}
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if something goes wrong?
:::'''Old Bai:''' You have to make it work. We'll fire those cannons at any cost.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Before you start, I don't run errands.
::'''Renke:''' Look what you've done, Old Bai. You've got them all shaken up! We've not even said anything, and they've shut us down.
::'''Old Bai:''' They're just joking. Stop being so serious!
::'''Old Bai:''' I shall not deceive you. We do indeed have something we'd like to ask of you. I hear the Nameless of the Astral Express are always happy to help others?

:As you arrive at the Skysplitter stage, you feel Renke fix your line of sight using some strange methods.
:'''Renke:''' Chest out! Head up! Higher! How are you going to see my display team in the skies if your head is buried like that?
:Renke uses the arm strength he used to train 800,000 Cloud Knights to forcibly fix your line of sight on the skies.
:'''Renke:''' This formation is adapted from ancient Xianzhou military formations. As they retreat, they tighten ranks to defend. As they attack, they advance straight. The routine changes endlessly.
:'''Renke:''' But don't think that this is all they've got to offer. From the most simple to the most complex maneuvers, they are all based on this simple square formation to allow for complex changes in large-scale combat operations.
:Seemingly lured in by your strange behavior, more spectators have begun to raise their eyes to the skies as the sounds of camera shutters begin to snap endlessly.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've seen it. Can we go now?
::'''Renke:''' You've barely seen anything yet!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Be gentler on people, that felt like a robbery.
::'''Renke:''' Relax, I don't want your money. I just want you to raise your head.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I... I don't see anything?
::'''Renke:''' How? Take a closer look! Oh, I get it. You've been watching on your phone, haven't you?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So? I watch everything on my phone.
:::'''Renke:''' That's where the problem is!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's this got to do with my phone?
:::'''Renke:''' It has everything to do with it!
:'''Renke:''' Of course, I'm not planning on holding your head the whole time and forcing you to keep watching the flight team... You are free now, free to watch as you please. If you have any thoughts to share after watching, make sure to come and tell me!
:{{tx}}

;(Talk to Renke)
:'''Renke:''' Hold on! The best part is still to come &mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's still not over yet?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've memorized all the formations already.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I forgot to turn off the gas on the Express...
:'''Renke:''' ...Wait, look! They've finally noticed, my exquisite flight squad!

----
:'''Old Bai:''' Just like that, we two old Skysplitter veterans have fulfilled our long-held dreams.
:'''Renke:''' Thank you, {{MC|f=miss|m=mister}}.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can really feel your love for it.
::'''Old Bai:''' No one has a greater love for the Skysplitter than I do.
::'''Renke:''' Nor me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's it for your wishes, surely?
::'''Old Bai:''' I want to set off the cannons again.
::'''Renke:''' Stop trying to make it difficult for {{MC|f=her|m=him}}.
:'''Old Bai:''' It feels comparable to if my daughter has grown up, and I'm finally giving her away on her wedding day. It's a bittersweet happiness...
