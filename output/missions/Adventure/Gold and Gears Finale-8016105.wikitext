{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Herta's Office|The Simulated Universe's storage was more limited than Herta expected! The data packs are at their limit and soon, the entire thing is going to stop working. Herta is prepared to see this thing through to the end by your side. Hurry and save all the previous Aeon data and ensure a proper end to this test before experiencing THEIR glory once more.}}

{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Herta's Office|update|It's all over. While you are still immersed in the shock brought by the data of Nous, Herta calls on you... She seems to have discovered something unusual &mdash; the little robot has developed "free will."}}

:'''Herta:''' (Trailblazer), you remember that sidekick? It left after its mission was accomplished.
:'''Herta:''' Still, it spent all the credits in its account to post a "Collaborator Recruitment" advert on the Interastral Network for the Simulated Universe. It said although it couldn't disclose the exact details of the job, it can honor the bet in a different way.
:'''Herta:''' I'm surprised by how developed the... "free will" of a robot is nowadays.
