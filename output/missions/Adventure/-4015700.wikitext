;(Talk to "Spirithief" Bartholos)
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Ahh &mdash; I surrender, I surrender! If you keep pulling like that, we'll be split apart!
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' You're getting better and better at turning time back. It's no wonder that old Oronyx is keen on you!
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehe... It would be such a shame to waste your talents on the right path. Would you be interested in a little collaboration?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of collaboration?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Though I may not have your talents, my reputation as the Master Thief is still known far and wide. Joining us would be a bet you wouldn't regret...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I would never associate with the likes of you!
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' It will take some time for the gavel of Talanton to fall. Why not hear me out before you make your decision?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Give me back my chest!
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' If you obsess over your small losses, you are sure to lose sight of the greater gains. Why not hear me out before you make your decision?
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehe, you see the tailor's shop on the corner? There's an antique vase in there. Unfortunately, the foot traffic is high in there, and it's tough to get a moment to strike.
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' But all you would need to do is waggle that little finger of yours, turn the clock back to a quiet evening with no one around, and I can walk right in and snap it up with ease...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this vase valuable?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just listening to that made my ears feel dirty.
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Don't be so hasty. I haven't finished!
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Then, you take the vase to an antique store to sell it. When the boss turns around to put it away in the warehouse, I will sneak in and grab their accounting book before anyone is any the wiser...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the accounting book valuable, too?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you're already in the warehouse, is that really all you're going to take?
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' This is no simple accounting book! There is an old land deed stashed in there that was signed even before the war of the Titans, back when Okhema was no more than wilderness.
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' As for the demarcated area... Don't let this shock you... But it is the current location of Kephale themself!
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' With this land deed, we will have a legitimate right to claim ownership of the Dawn Device. Then, when we say day, the sun will be high in the sky. When we say night, the world will fall dark before your eyes! If anyone wants to see the light of the sun, they will have to pay us a fair fee!
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehehe... When that time comes, I will buy this entire street and steal from any house I want. As for you? If you wanted to hold the Dawn Device for a bit to play, that would be perfectly fine~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't want to hold it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm taking 70%.
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Y&mdash;You're even worse than I am! This whole thing was my idea!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This land deed doesn't even exist, I bet?
:'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Tsk, this conversation is going nowhere. My throat is all hoarse from talking, and for what? Just take your darned chest and enjoy it yourself. Later!

;(Talk to "Spirithief" Bartholos)
----
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' S&mdash;So this is your home?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' It was completely vacant the last time I was here. You were moved in before Aquila could blink. I just came to take a look around and honestly, honestly&mdash;
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did I invite you here?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Haha, isn't it luxurious?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' It's far too extravagant in here! The stench of its opulence and lavishness makes me sick!
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' While I was making my way through wind and rain, you were here living it up in a mansion, throwing back ambrosia, and living the good life?
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' What is even more loathsome is that you live in such radiant luxury and would still squabble with me over a mere chest... Just the excess that leaks from the gaps in your teeth would keep me clothed and fed for a whole year.
::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Is there any fairness in this world? Is there any justice? Are there no laws anymore? If Talanton knew of this, they would burst into tears!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talanton has no interest in this.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' I don't care if Talanton has no interest, but my interest is fixed now! Hehe. If you dare stand in my way, you'd best be prepared to pay the price!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you want to stay here, you can come whenever you please.
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Huh? Uh... Are you serious? I'm not so free and easy as to just... Wait a minute. Are you making fun of me?
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' I'm the one that makes fun of others. No one has ever done it to me before... Hehe, you will pay for this!

;(Talk to "Spirithief" Bartholos)
:'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Bleh... I feel like the ground is spinning... I feel so sick!
:'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Kephale above. I am just an old man... The priest said that I would go through an ordeal when I was 884 years old... Could this be the day?
:'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Child, you have the wrong man. I am not the infamous Spirithief Bartholos. My name is Old Bart, a mere porter. I have come to move this chest on the orders of the Council of Elders.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Quit pretending, Bartholos!
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' We do indeed look similar. I can understand how you could mistake us...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Council of Elders is hiring elderly workers?
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' With the enemy at our gates, I naturally also wish to do my part for Okhema.
:'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Child, you do not believe me. I can understand that. Fortunately, we have plenty of time. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About your looks...
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' The creations of Cerces share common elements in life. Countless chimeras resemble each other, just as it is common for a spirit or two to look alike.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About your job...
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Back then, I was a lonely shade that roamed the wilderness. It was the elders that took me in. Seeing that I was fast of foot and deft with my hands, they allowed me to take on the duty of "porter."
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} About your sudden appearance...
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' Why would there be a chest just sitting around waiting for you to open it in a public place? No one dares to blindly interfere with it because it is the property of the elders. You were going to cross the line for a citizen, so I rushed to stop you.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The truth is clear as day.
::'''Old Bart the Porter:''' I put my everything into my work, and you still give an old man like me a hard time! Why don't you apologize to me and we'll call this settled!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, old man!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' "Sorry, old man~"
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehehe, I'm gonna laugh my head off!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Let me tell you! A trickster isn't scared of villains or fellow deceivers. What they're really scared of is punks like you! Na√Øve little sheep that waste all the effort we put into our traps!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Taking this chest doesn't even feel right anymore... Do us a favor and try not to get tricked so easily next time!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Bartholos, you're lying again!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Hehehe, you're pretty alert, huh? But in this life we live, is there anyone that isn't lying? If Kephale could talk, they'd be the biggest swindler of all!
:::'''"Spirithief" Bartholos:''' Take the chest. We'll meet again!
