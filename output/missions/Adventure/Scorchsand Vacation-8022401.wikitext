::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, this stage is requiring us to cure this thing with a whole therapy session now?
:::'''Big Ticker:''' Don't be naive, buddy. Failure isn't a sickness &mdash; it's a sin, and sins can't be cured.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've got an urgent matter to attend to... Can you please let us pass already?
:::'''Firefly:''' I know that this may sound like an exaggeration, but Penacony is actually in danger right now... We have to prevent it at all costs, sooner rather than later.
:::'''Big Ticker:''' Oh, another group of opportunistic challengers. Sorry, though I may be a failure of a clock, I still have my principles.
::'''Big Ticker:''' You guys are just like the other challengers. You want to enter my inner self? Then please, be my guest. But you won't find anything worthwhile... I'm just a failed piece.
