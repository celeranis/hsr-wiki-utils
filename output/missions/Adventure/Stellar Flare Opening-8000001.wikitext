{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Master Control Zone|update|You receive a message from a researcher named Grumpy hoping to talk with you in the Herta Space Station.<br />According to past experiences, similar requests usually come with pretty considerable rewards...

;(Talk to Grumpy)
----
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Grumpy?
:'''Grumpy:''' ...Who are you?
:'''Grumpy:''' Oh, if it isn't the famous (Trailblazer)? I'm sorry. I was immersed in my research and lost track of everything...
:'''Grumpy:''' I didn't expect you to respond to my humble request... I'm incredibly grateful!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll never miss a patch update.
::'''Grumpy:''' Patch... update? No wonder you're the savior of the space station. You are speaking in jargon that I can only dream of understanding...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Helping people is in my nature.
::'''Grumpy:''' Thank you so much... Don't worry, I'll have a few small tokens of appreciation for you.
:'''Grumpy:''' First, allow me to introduce myself &mdash; my name is Grumpy, and I'm a Level 1 researcher at the Department of Implement Arts.
:'''Grumpy:''' I just moved aboard the space station, so I'm still getting used to this place... I don't suppose you know Miss Wen Shiling, my tutor?
:'''Grumpy:''' Miss Shiling... How should I put this? She's a great person. It's just... she's not the best at mentoring. You basically have to rely on your own wits to get some direction if you're working under her...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Office politics? That's my forte.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd like to hear the main point...
:'''Grumpy:''' ...Ahem, sorry about that. I shouldn't have told you all that. In a nutshell, Miss Shiling threw me a set of weird simulation software and asked me to test them.
:'''Grumpy:''' At first, I thought she gave me some junk software that can be found all over the place &mdash; the kind where you've got no idea who's developed it. It's probably riddled with bugs and keeps crashing every few seconds. But actually...
:'''Grumpy:''' ...It was a complete and logically-consistent battle simulator, and the developer even gave it an official name: Stellar Flare.
:'''Grumpy:''' That makes things a bit hard for me... If it was some tacky half-baked software, then I'd only need to spend an afternoon running some simple tests for a two-page report before handing it over.
:'''Grumpy:''' But this is a genuine combat simulator... I can't master it on my own. My report is due next week, but I've made no progress at all... So I'm really hoping you can help in any way at all.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you asked Herta for help?
::'''Grumpy:''' ...Miss Herta? No no no, how could a small fry like me go to her with something like this...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you asked Asta for help?
::'''Grumpy:''' ...The lead researcher? No no no, how could a small fry like me go to her with something like this...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you asked that guard over there for help?
::'''Grumpy:''' ...No way. He has his own job, and he can't skip his work just to help me with something personal...
:'''Grumpy:''' Anyway, since you're here... Can I trouble you to take a moment and have a look at this "Stellar Flare" for me?
:'''Grumpy:''' This simulator has lots of stages, and the developer even split each stage into three difficulty levels. But even the easiest mode... is far too much for me.
:'''Grumpy:''' But for an experienced Trailblazer like yourself, this kind of simulation should be a walk in the park, right? I installed Stellar Flare in the terminal right over there... It should be on the desk.
:'''Grumpy:''' My performance appraisal is all on you, (Trailblazer)...
