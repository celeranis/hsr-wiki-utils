{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Sampo)
;(If {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620102-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Ooh, got all the materials ready? Let's get to synthesizing then. See how this business works.
:;(Open item submission menu&colon; [[Mr. Cold Feet's Pop-Up Shop/Product Plan#The Fluid, the Myth, the Legend|The Fluid, the Myth, the Legend]])
:;(If the menu is closed without submitting the items)
::'''Sampo:''' What, not enough materials? Don't worry. I'll wait for you to get some. Come back anytime.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620103--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620201-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Just wanna chat? I thought of a joke recently. Give me your feedback: "The world brims with narcissistic wisdom. Only a fool knows that they're all a joke!"
::'''Sampo:''' You don't know what's so funny about that? That's the point &mdash; because it's just {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|a joke}}, haha.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620203--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620301-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Business people like us are all about buying things from one place and selling them to other places. You might think that this meme isn't working out in Belobog, but someone might actually love it on some other planet.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620303--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620401-->)
::'''Sampo:''' I jest, but the Knights of Beauty are most deserving of my utmost admiration. There are only two types of people as steadfast as them: Idiots and fools.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620403--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620501-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Honestly though, these stress relief toys are really getting popular these days. Then again, the world's full of turmoil that makes it hard to laugh.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620503--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620601-->)
::'''Sampo:''' What are some tips there for self-deprecation, you ask? I'm not a comedic actor, I wouldn't know. But I have seen some who disregard the comedy of their routines and only doing their utmost to let others hear their own laughter...
::'''Sampo:''' Heavens, that's so scary. Please don't become someone like that.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 802620603--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 802620701-->)
::'''Sampo:''' Speaking of chaos, have you ever seen a farce? It's different from a regular comedy &mdash; there's no rhythm to the script, no main or secondary roles. The actors are heavily made up, stepping on each other's toes, twisting around together, with each one thinking they're the center of the world...
::'''Sampo:''' ...Oof, that sounds eerily similar to real life, and that won't do.
;(Otherwise)
::'''Sampo:''' This business will succeed for sure! Come back often, fam!

::'''Sampo:''' Ahh, fam! It's been such a long time, and I missed you dearly. Old Sampo here has a great idea that won't make money. You interested in getting in on it?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Won't" make money...?
:::'''Sampo:''' Hahaha, don't fret on the details. We're all old friends here. How about lending a hand, eh?
:::Why are you asking for my help to not make money?
:::'''Sampo:''' Oh buddy, you're not in the know then. Sometimes the most fun opportunities are those that won't make money!
:::Interesting. Count me in.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you asking for my help to not make money?
:::'''Sampo:''' Oh buddy, you're not in the know then. Sometimes the most fun opportunities are those that won't make money!
:::Interesting. Count me in.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Interesting. Count me in.
::'''Sampo:''' Ha, I knew you were a smart one!
::'''Sampo:''' Long story short, I was feeling really lonely, so I made a trip to Penacony not long ago. And then I remembered something...
::'''Sampo:''' Look, a meme crate that's been aged for eight years. Hidden right here in the Belobogian snow fields! No, wait... I found it eight years ago, so how many years would it be now?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where did this even come from?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you talking about it like it's liquor?
::'''Sampo:''' Thou shalt not inquire of the merchant the mysteries of their craft. After Jarilo-VI returned to the silver rail, I got to know several friends beyond the sky &mdash; that was when I was clued in on how big the market for this stuff was.
::{{tx}}
{{Mission Description|type=adventure|location=Administrative District|update|Sampo is about to add some new treasures to the store... but before that, he still needs your help.}}
:'''Sampo:''' See? I'm not lying to you. This business is really this easy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I mean, it is, but...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You sure this isn't a front for something shady?
:'''Sampo:''' Balderdash. I refund all who leave bad reviews. How am I doing something illegal? It's buying and selling, after all, and we can't always meet every customer's needs. But as for what we're doing here, our products aren't that important. It's the very fun of trading.
:'''Sampo:''' I'm not making this up. I don't know if you've heard of this tale: There is a tavern at the end of the world that contains people from all walks of life. No matter who they are, all are welcome for a drink as long as they can provide entertainment.
:'''Sampo:''' This trading biz of ours isn't any different from the drinks available in that bar &mdash; we're all selling a sentimental value! Come, take a look at the complete goods list. Satisfaction guaranteed.
