;(Talk to Diting)
:'''Diting:''' Woof woof! Woof!
:This little one is different than other Ditings you've seen... Its eyes are ferocious and its stare is locked on the Aether Coins around your waist.
:'''Diting:''' Rrrr&mdash;woof!
:From its barking, you can sense an intense will to fight. As you look closer you notice... it's got an Aether Coin in its mouth!

:'''Diting:''' Rrr&mdash;ruff ruff woof! Woof woof!
:From its barking, you feel a sense of praise, a hint of resentment, an inkling of regret at their defeat, and a sprinkle of determination to grow stronger.
:'''(Trailblazer):''' (I didn't realize "Aetherium Wars" can even be mastered by a Diting...)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Best to just not mess with it...
