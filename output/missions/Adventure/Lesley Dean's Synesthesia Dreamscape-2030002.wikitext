::'''Robert's Best Friend:''' It's 16k res. At least that's what he said... Well, you want to rent it?
::'''Robert:''' I... I don't have any money at all. My mom cut off my allowance ever since she caught me secretly renting tapes last time...
::'''Robert's Best Friend:''' What!? What's wrong with liking movies? Plus, this is Lesley Dean's debut work! Your mother has no taste at all.
::'''Robert's Best Friend:''' Don't worry. I'll cover it this time. Come to my place after school next time and we can watch it together.
::'''Robert:''' Thank you, Harry...

::'''Lesley Dean:''' Robert... I feel like our senses were linked for a moment then...
::'''Lesley Dean:''' His home planet is an impoverished land that has been under IPC sanctions ever since the Interstellar Energy War. The only way that they are able to watch movies is by renting tapes from smugglers at a high price.
::'''Lesley Dean:''' Harry is Robert's best friend, and he's like an older brother to him. I can sense that Robert relies on him greatly...

::'''Robert's Mother:''' ...Wake up, Rob. We live in a world without hope. These concepts of "interstellar travel" and "cosmic star" have nothing to do with us.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Running away?
:::'''Lesley Dean:''' Running away from the shadow that kept him trapped... Running away from the truth that his best friend had died. He thought that if he only found me and fulfilled their dream, then the dark shadow of their past would disappear.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Harry...
:::'''Lesley Dean:''' His lost friend has been haunting him this whole time. He thought that if he only found me and fulfilled their dream, then the dark shadow of their past would disappear.

::'''Lesley Dean:''' However, when this bubble that gave him a place to hide suddenly burst... He no longer knew where to go.
::'''Lesley Dean:''' So, that's why he went into this "undertaking"... Giving up on himself to maintain a false ideal.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do you think we should do?
::'''Lesley Dean:''' We have to make Robert remember... We have to make him remember that light he once had in his life.
::'''Lesley Dean:''' In this story, "I" am no more than a scapegoat. We have to allow Harry to become Robert's star once more.
::'''Lesley Dean:''' Please, help him, (Trailblazer).

:'''Lesley Dean:''' ...
:'''Lesley Dean:''' {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer), I have realized something.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' May I share it with you?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm listening.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' There was a moment just now... I suddenly felt like all of the problems that had been bothering me before were no longer important.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was it Flora that helped you realize this?
::'''Lesley Dean:''' I think so.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' "Who am I"... This question has been following me since the moment I first took this form.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' When I was reading Flora's memories, I felt like I was inside a painting for the first time. Her words and emotions truly shook my heart.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' At that moment, I finally believed: I no longer need to doubt my own existence. I am an extension of the life of Lesley Dean.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' I am composed of Lesley Dean's memories, along with people's ideas and impressions of him. I have started to feel... That these two things are enough to form a person, to make me, me... I no longer need this hollow body to prove my existence.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' Thank you, {{MC|f=Ms.|m=Mr.}} (Trailblazer). Without your help, I would never have been able to do any of this alone.
:'''Lesley Dean:''' Let us leave this place. I'm feeling... tired.
