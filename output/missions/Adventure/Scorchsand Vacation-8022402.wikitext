::'''Aideen:''' The missing workers have returned. You have really done us a good deed. You have my thanks on behalf of SoulGlad™!
::'''Aideen:''' After passing numerous challenges, you have proven yourself. You truly deserve the title of "Festive Superstar"!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, you're the final boss?
:::'''Aideen:''' No no no. Of course not. Looks like you still got more in you, huh? But these old bones of mine won't last a second against you.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, you're the director?
:::'''Aideen:''' Haha, I'm just this film's sponsor. As for the director... that's someone else.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What on earth is going on?
::'''Aideen:''' I'm ashamed to admit that we couldn't hold the award ceremony for you due to the technical issues. As such, I invited a cosmically-renewed artist to make a "Memory Film" just for you.
::'''Aideen:''' Through this, I hope to reignite the glorious moments of victory for you... and capture your exhilarating journey as it unfolds, etching it within this film. In the future, we can share this joyful time with all our esteemed guests.
::'''Aideen:''' Just as you've experienced, it's all about a thrilling blend of danger and excitement, the perilous memes of the Memory Zone, the delectable delight of SoulGlad, and an immersive journey through the Scorchsand Festival.
::'''Aideen:''' In the not-too-distant future, the Dreamscape stores will all have a film like this one, to let everyone know what it's like to be a Festive Superstar. The SoulGlad corporation will also use this moment to create new opportunities upon the tides of commerce!
::'''Aideen:''' Got any other questions, superstar?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} About that Memory Zone Meme...
:::'''Aideen:''' Oh! What a wild, magnificent, and powerful existence. It's like a living nightmare! I'm very much tempted to design a new SoulGlad flavor based on it. I shall call it "DeathGlad"!
:::'''Aideen:''' The strange things is... This terrifying creature has somehow been rendered so fragile, and yet it managed to break into the Moment of Scorchsand. For the safety of everyone, we spared no effort to have it captured.
:::'''Aideen:''' When shooting this film, we couldn't get the rights to that Knight of Beauty, so we had the director place this monster as the final obstacle. Isn't that a thrill?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You shouldn't have kept it here.
::::'''Aideen:''' Oh my, did it bring you any inconveniences? Truly sorry!
::::'''Aideen:''' That makes sense. I heard this one caused no shortage of trouble in the dreams. If the Hounds found out about it being here, it might bring no end of trouble to the SoulGlad corporation... Best to send it back to the edge of the Dreamscape.
