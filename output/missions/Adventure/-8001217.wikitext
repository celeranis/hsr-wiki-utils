;(Talk to Uldan)

::'''Uldan:''' Welcome to the Belobog History and Culture Museum, {{MC|f=young miss|m=young man}}. Is there anything an old man like me can help you with?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm just here to visit the museum.
:::'''Uldan:''' Oh hoho, you're at the wrong place. This is the museum's warehouse. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here solely to talk with older people.
:::'''Uldan:''' Hah, what a unique hobby. However, this is a museum after all. Since you're here, might as well have a tour. Head out then turn right, the exhibition hall is past the reception counter.
::'''Uldan:''' If you have any questions along your tour, or if you have any feedback or opinions, welcome to come talk to me...
::'''Uldan:''' ...I am Uldan, former dean of the Belobog College of Art, and now the curator of this museum. Pleased to meet you.

::::{{DIcon|?}} About the portrait of Cyrille the Fool...
:::::'''Uldan:''' (Trailblazer)... Did you say that the description of {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Cyrille the Fool's}} portrait deviated from the truth?
:::::'''Uldan:''' But... how's that possible? The description is taken from the history textbooks of the Belobog Academy. Everything is in black and white.
:::::{{DIcon|Talk}} I met Cyrille before.
::::::'''Uldan:''' Well... Stop pulling my leg.
::::::'''Uldan:''' Still, I can tell you have at least heard of Cyrille from your tone.
:::::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have evidence that supports Cyrille.
::::::'''Uldan:''' Since you sound so sure of yourself, I'll take a look at your evidence.

:An oil painting depicting the Administrative District in its full majesty.
:The Administrative District depicted in the painting is much larger than you remember. Maybe it's because there are many places off-limits to you.
