::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Yo, great job. I wasn't holding my breath and didn't expect anyone from the space station could clear this game."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now the words are different...
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Because this isn't pre-recorded. It's me, talking right now with you."
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's "you"?
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Yep, I'm talking with you on-screen in real-time."
::'''Strange Monitor:''' "According to the agreement, we're allowed to talk. Anything you want to chat about?"
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why's it called Cosmic Warfare?
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Oh, there's not much to it. There's a collector looking for a rare strategy for this game, and the top prize is a Tyranid fighter jet, which is exactly what I want."
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "But Cosmic Warfare is a multiplayer co-op game, so I can't play it alone. I need friends to play it &mdash; the more the merrier. I was just worrying about this, and never expected the answer to fall right into my lap."
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "You oughta be able to guess what happens next. Don't worry. I told you it's just a game, nothing more."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What are those spam messages all about?
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "I wrote those based on the IPC's advertising mails to build up ambiance. Don't you think they sound similar? ...Hang on, did you just say ''spam''?"
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Is there a more practical reward available...
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Snap a screenshot, and find a way to send it to Punklorde. If you're lucky, you might get an embroidered badge. They love that kind of stuff."
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'd like to ask you about...
:::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Oh yes, ask whatever you like."
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} I know you.
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Haha, you remember me? I never thought we'd be meeting like this again, either. Call it fate."
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Your gaming skills aren't too bad at all, if I recall correctly. Looking forward to playing a few more rounds with you later."
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What is your objective?
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "I said, it's just a game. Isn't it incredible? Do I have to have an ulterior motive?"
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Oh, if you mean the Stellaron Hunters... Then sorry, I'm the wrong person to ask. I'm just following orders. You should ask Kafka &mdash; She's always been more interested in your stuff than me."
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why did you join the Stellaron Hunters?
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Weird question but okay. Do you always just stay in the beginner's zone, Punklorde? Punklorde is a boring place where everyone thinks they're the master of reality. A place that's full of knock-off prosthetics, fake passes Accounts, and also some genius hackers..."
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "The most skilled of which, is currently talking to you."
::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "I wanted out of there, and the Stellaron Hunters were very welcoming &mdash; it's that simple."

:::::'''Strange Monitor:''' "Alright, thanks. I've finally mastered Cosmic Warfare &mdash; It's not too bad playing online with strangers, right?"
