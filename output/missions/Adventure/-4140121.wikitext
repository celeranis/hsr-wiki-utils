:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' *Snore*... *Snore*...
:A strange snoring is coming from inside the experimental plant nurseries, which reminds you of a wondrous encounter with a talking plant elsewhere in the space station.
:But obviously there are no plants here &mdash; only half-dead weeds as far as the eye can see.
:You decide to...
:Do a good deed, and pull out the weeds with your bare hands!
:The researchers may have been evacuated from here, but ignoring weeds in the experimental plant nurseries is no good. You enthusiastically reach out both hands to get started on the weeding process.
:'''???:''' Snort... *snooze*?
:You seem to have pulled at a heavy object. It feels quite warm to the touch, too.
:You give it an almighty yank, and out of the blue this little thing pushes your hand away before looking up at you with puppy dog eyes.
:Do nothing.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Ow-wee... You almost pulled out my hair clip...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry, I thought these were all weeds.
::But obviously there are no plants here &mdash; only half-dead weeds as far as the eye can see.
::You decide to...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where did you come from?

:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Ow-wee... You almost pulled out my hair clip...
:Sorry, I thought these were all weeds.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' ...I don't have any weeds growing on my head. Look! These are flowers. My favorite little pretty flowers.
:Where did you come from?
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' ...Shouldn't I be the one asking you that? I was sleeping nice and snugly right here before you suddenly tugged me up.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' The soil here is very fertile, and a kind-hearted flower told me that pretty flowers would grow out of my head if I just lay here.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Check out the top of my head. Isn't it beautiful!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think that's a four-leaf clover.
::You give it an almighty yank, and out of the blue this little thing pushes your hand away before looking up at you with puppy dog eyes.
::Do nothing.
::'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Ow-wee... You almost pulled out my hair clip...
::Sorry, I thought these were all weeds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Flowers... can talk to you?
::'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Ow-wee... You almost pulled out my hair clip...
::Sorry, I thought these were all weeds.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mmm, it really is beautiful.

:I think that's a four-leaf clover.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' They're flowers that can bring you luck &mdash; not weeds.
:Flowers... can talk to you?
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Of course. You can talk, I can talk, so isn't it totally normal for flowers to talk, too?
:Mmm, it really is beautiful.
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Right? It's beautiful!
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' That's right. How long have I been out for... Why am I the only one left? Where are my little friends?
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Have they all gone home? *sob* It's game over. I don't know the way back. How am I going to get home!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Point out the way home for it)
:'''Ruan Mei's Sleepy Creation:''' Check out the top of my head. Isn't it beautiful!
