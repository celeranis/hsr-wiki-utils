:'''Dahao:''' This wretched clique of Coin Zealots... Who knows where they got their superstitious ideas from, but they insist on throwing stuff into jade wheels.
:'''Dahao:''' Isn't that utterly dangerous!? If a coin somehow got stuck in the engine and spit out, its velocity would be faster than a speeding bullet. Modern weapons are far scarier, of course, but its impact is still enough to shoot through flesh and bone.
