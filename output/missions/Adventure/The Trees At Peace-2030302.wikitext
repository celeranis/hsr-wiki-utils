:'''Chadwick:''' After that, I disbanded the team and left the lab. I managed to take some crucial data with me to keep them from falling into the wrong hands.
:'''Chadwick:''' I later learned from others that the higher-ups of the Technology Department who ordered the Imaginary Implosion Pulse detonation were subjected to an internal review. They were never heard of again.
:'''Chadwick:''' But I knew that IPC wouldn't let the matter rest. The result of our research was way too valuable... Although they released a statement condemning the detonation, they would never really give up the technology related to it.
:'''Chadwick:''' They needed me to control the knowledge and keep it out of reach of other factions across the universe. So, they would always be breathing down my neck.
