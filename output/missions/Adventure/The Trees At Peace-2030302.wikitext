::'''Chadwick:''' ...A number that I try my best every day to forget. Ever since that day, I haven't dared to look in the mirror even once. I'm worried I might see a monster... A murderer who has killed countless people and ruined even more lives.

:'''Chadwick:''' That day in the control room was the last I saw Dudley. Perhaps, it's true that pawns don't deserve to be mentioned, just like how he put it.
:'''Chadwick:''' After that, I disbanded the team and left the lab. I managed to take some crucial data with me to keep them from falling into the wrong hands.
:'''Chadwick:''' I later learned from others that the higher-ups of the Technology Department who ordered the Imaginary Implosion Pulse detonation were subjected to an internal review. They were never heard of again.
:'''Chadwick:''' But I knew that IPC wouldn't let the matter rest. The result of our research was way too valuable... Although they released a statement condemning the detonation, they would never really give up the technology related to it.
:'''Chadwick:''' They needed me to control the knowledge and keep it out of reach of other factions across the universe. So, they would always be breathing down my neck.
:'''Chadwick:''' ...So, I decided to escape, not wanting to live the rest of my life being controlled by others.

:'''Voice of the Mind:''' After going through so many things, I still find it hard to believe that the foundation of the universe is a giant tree that nurtures countless leaves selflessly and voluntarily.
