;(Talk to Oleg)
:'''Oleg:''' Hey, (Trailblazer)! I can't believe you are here!
:'''Oleg:''' I didn't think you would come. After all, you have offered us a lot of help. I'd be imposing on you if I ask anything more from you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I enjoy fighting the Fragmentum.
::'''Oleg:''' Wow, I admire your fighting spirit! You remind me of myself when I was young, hahaha!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As long as I'll be rewarded, I'm open to any missions.
::'''Oleg:''' Of course, you will. How can we make you work for nothing?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll do my best to punish and eliminate the evil.
::'''Oleg:''' Wow, you're so righteous! You remind me of myself when I was young, hahaha!
:'''Oleg:''' By the way, this Corridor of Fading Echoes...
:'''Oleg:''' It's way more desolate than I imagined. A decade or so ago, the northern region of Belobog was in a better state than this.
:'''Oleg:''' I believe we'll repair the ruins and get rid of the monsters one day.
:'''Oleg:''' Listen up, (Trailblazer). The goal of this operation is simple: {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Destroy all the Fragmentum monsters in the Corridor of Fading Echoes}}.

;(Talk to Oleg)
:'''Oleg:''' As long as {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the thermic core is slotted into its base}}, the Snowshine Lamps will fire up.
:'''Oleg:''' Fire up the lamp, then {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|lure those scums into its energy field}} to destroy them one by one.

;(Talk to Oleg)
:'''Oleg:''' Well done, (Trailblazer)! Being straightforward has always been your style.
:'''Oleg:''' There are no more traces of monsters in the surroundings. The corridor should be peaceful from now on.
:'''Oleg:''' ...Yet, the effects of Fragmentum are here to stay. It's only a matter of time before they make a comeback. I might need your help again when the time comes.
:'''Oleg:''' I hope you'll keep in touch with William. That boy might not be articulate, but he is very reliable. Please be more patient with him.
:'''Oleg:''' These are for you. You can treat them as my rewards for you. Take care, (Trailblazer)!
