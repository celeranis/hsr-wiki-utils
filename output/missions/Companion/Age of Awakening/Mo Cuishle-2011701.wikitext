:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 132.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Relax, bro! I'm a man of my word. No need to stress out.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 102.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' And these two are... Oh, Miss Seele!? To think that two senior Wildfire members are concerned with my trivial problems...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 133 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 133 f.ogg}} '''Luka:''' They just came along to help. Don't mind them! Just tell us exactly what happened.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 133.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Came along to help, huh...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 103.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' O&mdash;Okay... this may sound strange but &mdash; I'm an amateur mechanic. I like collecting scrap in my free time, doing odd jobs like putting robots together... that sort of thing.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 104.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' But a few days ago, two of my robots suddenly disappeared! They were my pride and joy. I usually leave them in the tent when I head out &mdash; everyone in the settlement knows each other. This has never happened before...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 105.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' Someone must have set their sights on my robots and stolen them while I was gone &mdash; I just don't know how they managed it. Did they change the programming? But that's not possible...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe they just went out for a walk together.
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 106.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' H&mdash;Hey, stop kidding around! Can't you tell I have a serious problem on my hands...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why isn't that possible?
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 107.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' *sigh* It's not impossible, I just don't think there's anyone in the settlement capable of something like that.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 134.ogg}} '''Luka:''' I see, two robots... Do you have any clues? Any reasonable guesses? We need to have an opening to start the investigation.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 108.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' Not really... but here's the most mysterious part of all this:
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 109.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' One of the machines they stole was a drone &mdash; I call it Little Fay. Little Fay has an alarm that buzzes non-stop as soon as any unauthorized people get close. It's guaranteed to wake up the entire settlement.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 110.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' But I didn't hear Little Fay's alarm at all... I still can't figure out how that happened.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe it stopped working?
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 111.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' No way! Little Fay was shipshape &mdash; not a hitch nor glitch in sight.
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 135.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Hmm, a drone that was supposed to sound an alarm suddenly went silent... Worth remembering. Anything else?
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 113.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' Let me think... Oh, there is one other thing, but I don't know if it's useful...
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 114.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' Little Fay also has a tracker. If it gets too far from Big Ben &mdash; oh, Big Ben is the name of the other robot &mdash; if there's too much distance between them, Little Fay will automatically start routing and fly to Big Ben's location.
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 minerS 115.ogg}} '''Cassidy:''' ...That's all I suppose. I tried to find clues myself, but I don't know where to start. This job needs real professionals...
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 136.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Mm-hmm... Cool, we've got this! Don't worry, bro. We promise we'll find your robots!

:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 170.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Are you okay!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...Is this some kind of performance art?
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 171.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...Why are you so hyped? What's going on?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Defeater of evil throughout the world!"
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 172.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...Don't copy him!
::{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 173.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Seriously, why are you so hyped up today?
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 190.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Hahaha, it's just a normal victory celebration. No need to be so alarmed.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 174.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...You call that normal? I might have let it slide if it was in the cage... On second thought, no, that was cringe even by Fight Club standards.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 191.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Don't get so worked up, Seele! I'm thinking clearly! Plus, didn't we just get rid of another major threat to the Underworld?
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 175.ogg}} '''Seele:''' True, but quit changing the subject! This new "routine" of yours is just...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 192.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Hahaha, don't worry! I promise you, it'll only last till the end of my training. Actually, have I been making too many promises today? That's not a good habit...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 193.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Anyway, there's only one more step in my training plan. Come on guys, help me wrap it up!
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 176.ogg}} '''Seele:''' *sigh* ...I guess we're in too deep, better let it run its course. So tell us, what else is on the schedule.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 194.ogg}} '''Luka:''' The final step in this training &mdash; is to challenge boss Svarog!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh boy...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Noice! Count me in!
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 177.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Are you sure you're thinking clearly!?
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 195.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Whoa, whoa, stay cool, Seele. Like I said, I'm thinking clearly. Every word I said is serious!
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 196.ogg}} '''Luka:''' I set this as the final goal of my training a few days ago. Think about it &mdash; is there any Underworld opponent worth challenging more than Boss Svarog?
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 178.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...No, I can't agree to this, you're asking for trouble! Forget about winning or losing &mdash; the relationship between Wildfire and Svarog only just got patched up...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 197.ogg}} '''Luka:''' I'm not going to rile him up! Don't make this more complicated than it is. I'm just inviting him to have a fair fight with me, like how you'd have in the cage!
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 179.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Are you mad? Svarog is a robot! He doesn't understand the rules of the cage! He's different from us. His fists are made of steel&mdash;
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 198.ogg}} '''Luka:''' ...That means we're evenly matched, right?
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 180.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 181.ogg}} '''Seele:''' You know what I mean &mdash; don't act smart with me! Ugh, you don't make any sense...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 199.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Hahaha, I understand what you're saying, Seele! But you know, I'm a fighter... It's my duty to keep training and get stronger.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 200.ogg}} '''Luka:''' It's a terrible feeling to have a powerful opponent in your head but never be able to get close to him. It's all thanks to your patching things up with Svarog that I'm able to have this opportunity now &mdash; I'm not gonna miss it for the world!
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 182.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let him do it, Seele.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Svarog might go easy because we're here...
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 183.ogg}} '''Seele:''' ...Alright. Fine. We'll go find Svarog and have a nice chat with him.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 seele 184.ogg}} '''Seele:''' Lemme say this first &mdash; if he doesn't wanna deal with you as a challenger, then we're getting out of there ASAP.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 201.ogg}} '''Luka:''' Haha, don't worry, I'll convince him! But you're right. If he's not in the mood for it, then I won't force him.
:{{A|VO side1 lk1 luka 202.ogg}} '''Luka:''' I haven't really worked with boss Svarog before, so please, lead the way. Let's go!
