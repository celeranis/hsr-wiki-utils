===Pry open the lock of the door that seals the dock{{subst:void|<!--202030801-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Divination Commission|According to Genius Detective March 7th's deduction, a door lock like this could not stop Luocha, but visualizing a gentlemanly Luocha picking the lock while squatting in a dark corner like this is pretty humorous. Heh.}}
