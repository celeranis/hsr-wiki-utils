===Speak with Dahao at the Realm-Keeping Commission{{subst:void|<!--202030702-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery|update|After the Stellaron Crisis outbreak, the six commissions were busy as a bee trying to find the perpetrator in vain. Official Dahao of the Realm-Keeping Commission requested support from the Astral Express to identify suspects. Sounds like another bothersome case... However, as a Nameless, you should lend a helping hand as much as you can. Go talk to him.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery|update|In the process of helping the Realm-Keeping Commission in identifying suspects, something unexpected happened. The Realm-Keeping Commission isn't too anxious about it, but Welt was. The moment he saw Luocha's flawless face, he was stunned and cold sweat drenched his shirt. You don't know the reason, but Welt must have a good reason for being so unnerved. Continue to investigate this Mr. Luocha.<br />Say, what is March 7th so excited about, and since when did she have a "Genius Detective" tacked onto her name?}}
