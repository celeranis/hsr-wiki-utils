===Speak with Dahao at the Realm-Keeping Commission{{subst:void|<!--202030702-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery|update|After the Stellaron Crisis outbreak, the six commissions were busy as a bee trying to find the perpetrator in vain. Official Dahao of the Realm-Keeping Commission requested support from the Astral Express to identify suspects. Sounds like another bothersome case... However, as a Nameless, you should lend a helping hand as much as you can. Go talk to him.}}

;(Talk to Dahao)
:'''Guangjin:''' Hey, (Trailblazer). It's been a while.
:'''Guangjin:''' I've documented the previous operations to capture the Trotters. The report can be accessed and reviewed at any time.
:'''Guangjin:''' Would you like to re-visit them?
:Let me re-visit the previous operations.
:'''Guangjin:''' No problem. Please wait while I apply for access permission. By the way, this is historical information, which does not generate any operation payment.
:'''Guangjin:''' Are you sure you want to re-visit the previous operations, (Trailblazer)?
:Let's begin.
:'''Guangjin:''' Sure. As the info is complete, you'll be guaranteed an immersive experience.
:Forget it.
:'''Guangjin:''' Alright. Since you've helped the Realm-Keeping Commission on many occasions, you are welcome to access our operation archives any time.
:Maybe next time.
:'''Guangjin:''' Alright. Since you've helped the Realm-Keeping Commission on many occasions, you are welcome to access our operation archives any time.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here to help with the investigation.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 101.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Oh, so you are. And these would be... Miss March 7th and Mr. Yang, I presume?
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
:{{tx}}
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...What's wrong, Mr. Yang? See anything fishy?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 103.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Who's he? ...I'd like to see more information on him.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 105.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Which one? Let me see...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...What's wrong, Mr. Yang? See anything fishy?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I thought we talked about copying people.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is one of them a threat?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's kick some butt so we can get back to resting.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Resting? Booooring!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 104.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I don't have any concrete evidence... but I think he's worth checking out.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 106.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Oh, him? I remember him. He's a traveling merchant. He trades throughout the universe, knows a thing or two about remedial arts too. He registered himself on the Xianzhou as... what was it again...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 103.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Luocha. His name is Luocha.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 107.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' That's right, Luocha. He came to the Xianzhou with a huge box this time &mdash; some sort of funerary contraption. It had a funny name... something to do with coughing? It was pretty conspicuous &mdash; I had to ask him about it.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 104.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' "Coffin." It's a tool that certain non-Xianzhou travelers seem to use in death rites... I'm guessing our guests here might recognize it.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 108.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Hmph, I swear he said "coughing"... Anyway, we checked him out &mdash; his record on the Xianzhou is squeaky-clean. As for this "caffeine" thing...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 105.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Coffin.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 109.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Yeah, yeah. Either way, it definitely had something to do with funerals. There are lots of travelers on the Luofu, each with their own star system and death rites &mdash; I guess that must be Luocha's line of work... Is there something up with him?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 105.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Not necessarily... but I have my reasons for wanting to investigate. What was he doing in the days leading up to the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 110.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Hmm... that's complicated. Come with me to the Foursquare Mirror &mdash; it'll be easier to explain.
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 111.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Exalting Sanctum is one of the Luofu's crucial central cities &mdash; the higher-ups are very concerned about security issues here. That's why there are so many cycranes stationed in the area.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 112.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Luocha arrived on the Luofu a few days prior to the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection. Up until the day before the resurrection, there was nothing suspicious about his behavior...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I figured it out! The day before the resurrection, he appeared near the Ambrosial Arbor with a Stellaron!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Realm-Keeping Commission would have arrested him by now...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh yeah, I guess. You're pretty smart... sometimes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Eureka! That solves everything!
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 106.ogg}} '''Welt:''' If that were the case, the Realm-Keeping Commission would have arrested him by now &mdash; why look to us for help?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, yeah... Ah Geez, this is gonna be a tough case to crack if even my instincts are off...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 113.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Hahahaha, you lot are enthusiastic, I'll give you that. The reason I mention the day before the resurrection is because... we have no idea what he did that day.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 114.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' The resurrection brought about unusual yinyang phenomena that caused the entire cycrane system to malfunction. The image data from the day of the incident is beyond restoration, and data from the day before was badly affected.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you just ask him?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 115.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' We will, in due course. But we can't be too general &mdash; specific questions are key. Not to mention, without a clear suspicion, it would involve multiple interrogations...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 116.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' So... if you feel this Luocha is suspicious in some way, make it known. Then I can arrange for his detention and interrogation.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 107.ogg}} '''Welt:''' How should I put this... He just looks kind of...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Mr. Yang! You were going off his appearance this whole time? I thought you had some super secret thing up your sleeve! Didn't your mom ever tell you not to judge a book by its&mdash;
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} &mdash;Cover!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} His appearance? He looks pretty handsome to me...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Exactly! ...Huh? W&mdash;Wait! That's not the point!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yup, he just rubs me the wrong way!
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Where's this anger coming from?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Sorry, what I mean is... hmm. It's difficult to explain, but my instinct tells me this Luocha is involved somehow.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Apologies, I realize this is personal speculation.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 117.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' That's alright &mdash; instinct is an important part of any Realm-Keeping Commission investigation. There are times when my gut tells me something's not right, and there's usually a reason for it. I'm with you on this one.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 118.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Be that as it may, as an official, I can't go bringing someone in based on a villainous appearance...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 106.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' ...Because if a complaint led to his dismissal, it would leave a blemish on his resume, making it difficult for him to advance his career for the next few centuries.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 119.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Precise&mdash; No! What are you talking about... Anyway, if you do want to investigate, I can grant you access to the Foursquare Mirror... Jingyan, you'll be assisting our esteemed guests in their investigation.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 107.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Isn't it inappropriate for an officer of the Realm-Keeping Commission to assist the public in investigating someone?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 120.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Bah, not at all... Make sure you don't leave the Commission &mdash; just help them check the cycrane footage.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 121.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Keep me updated on progress &mdash; if you find hard evidence, I'll be there in a flash. One thing though &mdash; don't approach him. If you make a discovery, contact me first.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 110.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We're thankful that you're entrusting this to us &mdash; we'll keep it by the book.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 113.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Don't worry, the Express Crew keeps its promises. We won't disappoint you.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 dahao 122.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' *sigh* Jingyan, over to you. I need to get going.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 108.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Understood.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 109.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' This might take you some time. Come and find me when you're ready.

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery|update|In the process of helping the Realm-Keeping Commission in identifying suspects, something unexpected happened. The Realm-Keeping Commission isn't too anxious about it, but Welt was. The moment he saw Luocha's flawless face, he was stunned and cold sweat drenched his shirt.

{{Dialogue Start}}


;(Talk to March 7th)
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 121.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hoo-wee! We may be new to the Xianzhou, but we're already investigating the mysterious disappearance of Luocha...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're acting a little weird today...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Am I? I feel pretty normal. Anyway, this case has really got my detective blood pumping. I need to get to the bottom of it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're in high spirits today.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yup! I always dreamed of a head-scratcher like this &mdash; a chance to showcase my detective genius.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I've been familiarizing myself with The Angler Mystery lately. &mdash; I think it's safe to say I have the best investigative mind on the Express at this point...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Angler Mystery?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 112.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' You have good taste, Miss March. The Angler Mystery is a classic detective novel on the Xianzhou... I read it when I was young and dreamed about working in the Commission ever since.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 113.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' I didn't think it would be attracting new readers more than 200 years later.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *gasp* A fellow reader! But Miss Jingyan, the author &mdash; Su Fang &mdash; was the lead medical assistant in an apothecary, and the main character &mdash; the Angler &mdash; is a healer... Why didn't you want to join the Alchemy Commission instead?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 114.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' *sigh* A number of reasons. This job may be trivial, but I have my reasons for being here... Plus, hehe, the threshold for the Alchemy Commission was too difficult for me to reach.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I see... But your lives are so long &mdash; shouldn't career change be easy?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 115.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' I considered it once... That was a long time ago. The longer I stay in this job, the more I understand its purpose. Fighting crime, helping the weak, solving the problems no one wants to touch... It's a satisfying feeling.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Wow, good for you Miss Jingyan.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 124.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Sounds like you really care.

;(Talk to Welt Yang)
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 111.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I owe you two an apology &mdash; my speculations have gotten us into a delicate situation... I'll treat you to some Xianzhou delicacies later.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I want a full Garden of Gourmet feast!
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 112.ogg}} '''Welt:''' No problem. Let's get this settled first, though.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No big deal, we're all on the same team after all.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 113.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Mm, I'm glad to hear you say that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} With March here, it's always a delicate situation.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 114.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah right... Anyway, since when did investigators shy away from delicate situations?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 115.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...I did wanna say something, though. Umm, I don't think Mr. Yang is the kind of person to make a judgment based only on instinct...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you say that?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 116.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Gut feeling.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think so too.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 114.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Mm... It's not something I need to conceal from you.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 115.ogg}} '''Welt:''' As you know, there are infinite worlds in this universe that can be similar yet different from each other in various ways. The same is true of the people on those worlds.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 116.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's why it's possible for us to run into individuals on multiple worlds who share an appearance, but not a personality... For all we know, in some faraway world, March's adorable face might belong to an intergalactic pirate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} *silence*
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I knew she was suspicious.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 117.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! He was just giving an example! I'm the nicest girl in the galaxy.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 117.ogg}} '''Welt:''' However... in most cases, their fates will walk a similar course. I've seen two people who looked almost identical to this Luocha... They were not of the virtuous persuasion.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 118.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's why the moment I laid eyes on him, a chill ran down my spine. March is right &mdash; we shouldn't judge a book by its cover... but I can't overlook this.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 119.ogg}} '''Welt:''' *sigh* I don't want to force you into trusting my judgment, but...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 118 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 118 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What are you talking about? Of course we trust your judgment, Mr. Yang! Right, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's right, we believe in you!
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 120.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm glad you believe in me, truly. But the problem remains: Will the Realm-Keeping Commission trust a judgment based on this logic?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It isn't our trust you need...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 121 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' You're right, (Trailblazer). The key is whether the Realm-Keeping Commission will trust a judgment based on this logic.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} On the Express, we always trust our own.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 119.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Of course, crew members are always right.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 122.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm glad you believe in me, truly. But the problem remains: Will the Realm-Keeping Commission trust a judgment based on this logic?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 110.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' From a Xianzhou legal standpoint, the Realm-Keeping Commission is unable to accept a judgment like this.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 120.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 111.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' It's not that we distrust you, Mr. Yang, but we cannot act on groundless accusations. I hope you understand.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 123.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Of course. We raised the accusation, we will carry the burden of proof.

;(Talk to Jingyan)
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 126.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Thanks for waiting. I checked all the footage we have of the open area... I say "all" &mdash; a lot of it was lost.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Are the corrupted parts recoverable? Can we use the same methods again?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 127.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' For some of them, maybe... but I can't guarantee anything. I'll do my best, of course. It'll take more time &mdash; I can't hand them over just now.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Thank you. Did you find anything in the remaining footage worth paying attention to?
:{{tx}}
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 153.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? I... Isn't this a scene from The Angler Mystery?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That novel's gone to your head...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 154.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Shh &mdash; you're being annoying! I'm not kidding &mdash; this is straight out of the book.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you talking about?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 155.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Angler Mystery &mdash; the novel! There's a scene that's identical to this footage.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 129.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Now that you mention it...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 132.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm not sure I follow.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 156.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Angler's origin story, of course. He's a healer from the Alchemy Commission who gets on the wrong side of a mysterious organization called the Tea Society. Two agents in dark clothing wait for him to be alone and then poison him.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 157.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The drug has the same de-aging effect as the Vidyadhara's hatching rebirth &mdash; the Angler gets younger and turns back into a child. From there on out, the Angler pursues the Tea Society while solving all kinds of strange cases.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why would a "tea society" be so vicious...?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 133.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Their tea must be stronger than Himeko's coffee...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 158.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Tea Society is just a code name, did you think they'd call themselves the Evil Society? They have to have a nice-sounding name to conceal themselves!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A drug like that sounds like it would help people stricken with mara...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 159.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It wouldn't. In the book, the drug only de-ages the body &mdash; it can't repair damage to the soul. In other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 134.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hatching rebirths are specific to the Vidyadhara... Can humans also experience de-aging?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 160.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Eh, it's just a novel &mdash; who knows if something like that could happen in reality. I thought of it as soon as I saw this footage, though.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 130.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Su Fang, the author, was a medical assistant in the Alchemy Commission. The medical principles in the novel are strictly grounded in reality.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 161.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' True... If someone from the Alchemy Commission was suggesting it could be done, then there's always a possibility.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 135.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So, March, what you mean is, the two people in dark clothing are Tea Society agents, and the child is... a de-aged Luocha?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 162.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *gasp* What if a crazy Angler Mystery fan decided to commit a copycat crime? Luocha gets turned into a child, then follows a mysterious duo in black... The plot thickens &mdash; this could be a kidnapping!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 136.ogg}} '''Welt:''' *sigh* The child in the footage has black hair. Luocha's hair is blonde.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Adult Luocha might look blonde, but maybe he's just going gray with age...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 163.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! Makes sense to me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} True, their hair color is completely different.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 164.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmm... Maybe he dyed his hair!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 131.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Hold your horses, everyone... I recognize this child now. That's Yinshu &mdash; the young shopkeeper at Spare Time Book Shop.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 137.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Too bad, March. No de-aging, no Angler.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And the child is a girl.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 165.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Uh, a d&mdash;detective's initial conjectures are bound to be wrong! Totally expected!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Remember Julian back in Belobog...?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 166.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No, no, this is completely different.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 138.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The cycranes weren't able to get a clear look at the two people in dark clothing... Let's ask Yinshu, maybe she saw something.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 132.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' I'll keep trying to recover the lost footage. I'll contact you if there's a breakthrough.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 167.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Alright, let's go! Time to interview the witness!

:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 116.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' I can bring up the data anytime from here. Are you ready?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Ready, let's do it.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 117.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Alright, follow me.
::{{Black Screen|Jingyan takes everyone to the Foursquare Mirror and begins to retrieve the footage.}}
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 118.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' As Official Dahao mentioned, the Arbor caused unusual yinyang phenomena which affected the entire cycrane system.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 119.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' We lost a lot of video footage, and for the image data we recovered, the timestamps are all jumbled up... Look, this is Mr. Luocha on the day prior to the resurrection.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So we have to clean up and reorder the footage ourselves?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 120.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Exactly. Thank you again for your help.

:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 126.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Thanks for waiting. I checked all the footage we have of the open area... I say "all" &mdash; a lot of it was lost.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Are the corrupted parts recoverable? Can we use the same methods again?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 127.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' For some of them, maybe... but I can't guarantee anything. I'll do my best, of course. It'll take more time &mdash; I can't hand them over just now.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Thank you. Did you find anything in the remaining footage worth paying attention to?
:{{tx}}
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 153.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? I... Isn't this a scene from The Angler Mystery?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That novel's gone to your head...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 154.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Shh &mdash; you're being annoying! I'm not kidding &mdash; this is straight out of the book.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you talking about?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 155.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Angler Mystery &mdash; the novel! There's a scene that's identical to this footage.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 129.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Now that you mention it...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 132.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm not sure I follow.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 156.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Angler's origin story, of course. He's a healer from the Alchemy Commission who gets on the wrong side of a mysterious organization called the Tea Society. Two agents in dark clothing wait for him to be alone and then poison him.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 157.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The drug has the same de-aging effect as the Vidyadhara's hatching rebirth &mdash; the Angler gets younger and turns back into a child. From there on out, the Angler pursues the Tea Society while solving all kinds of strange cases.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why would a "tea society" be so vicious...?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 133.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Their tea must be stronger than Himeko's coffee...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 158.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' The Tea Society is just a code name, did you think they'd call themselves the Evil Society? They have to have a nice-sounding name to conceal themselves!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A drug like that sounds like it would help people stricken with mara...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 159.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It wouldn't. In the book, the drug only de-ages the body &mdash; it can't repair damage to the soul. In other words, it's like molting, not a true rebirth.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 134.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hatching rebirths are specific to the Vidyadhara... Can humans also experience de-aging?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 160.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Eh, it's just a novel &mdash; who knows if something like that could happen in reality. I thought of it as soon as I saw this footage, though.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 130.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Su Fang, the author, was a medical assistant in the Alchemy Commission. The medical principles in the novel are strictly grounded in reality.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 161.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' True... If someone from the Alchemy Commission was suggesting it could be done, then there's always a possibility.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 135.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So, March, what you mean is, the two people in dark clothing are Tea Society agents, and the child is... a de-aged Luocha?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 162.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *gasp* What if a crazy Angler Mystery fan decided to commit a copycat crime? Luocha gets turned into a child, then follows a mysterious duo in black... The plot thickens &mdash; this could be a kidnapping!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 136.ogg}} '''Welt:''' *sigh* The child in the footage has black hair. Luocha's hair is blonde.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Adult Luocha might look blonde, but maybe he's just going gray with age...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 163.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! Makes sense to me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} True, their hair color is completely different.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 164.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmm... Maybe he dyed his hair!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 131.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' Hold your horses, everyone... I recognize this child now. That's Yinshu &mdash; the young shopkeeper at Spare Time Book Shop.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 137.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Too bad, March. No de-aging, no Angler.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And the child is a girl.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 165.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...Uh, a d&mdash;detective's initial conjectures are bound to be wrong! Totally expected!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Remember Julian back in Belobog...?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 166.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' No, no, this is completely different.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 138.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The cycranes weren't able to get a clear look at the two people in dark clothing... Let's ask Yinshu, maybe she saw something.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 jingyan 132.ogg}} '''Jingyan:''' I'll keep trying to recover the lost footage. I'll contact you if there's a breakthrough.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 167.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Alright, let's go! Time to interview the witness!

:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 103.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' That footage... I remember that day. After I closed up the store, I walked around for a while. I was looking for a place to read.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 104.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' I found that empty area &mdash; it seems like a good reading spot at first... but then I noticed two people dressed in dark clothing and a blonde outworlder hanging around. Something didn't feel right, so I left. Those two people left the same way I did.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 188.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So you just happened to be going the same way... Did you see what the outworlder was doing?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 105.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' Sorry, I was only trying to find a place to read, I didn't pay much attention to him... or the two in dark clothing.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 106.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' All I remember is... the two people in dark clothing &mdash; they smelled pretty bad. I guess that's not much of a clue. Sorry I can't give you any useful information.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 141.ogg}} '''Welt:''' On the contrary, any information you can give is valuable. Thank you very much.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 142.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Still, according to the cycrane recordings, Luocha's final stop before heading towards the open area was your store.

:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 108.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' He came in, looked at a few titles, and then handed one to me... an old paperback.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 109.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' Everything seemed normal, but after paying for it he immediately tore off the title page. I was shocked, but he was grinning ear to ear, so I didn't dare ask him about it.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 110.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' After that, he just left the book on the counter and went on his way.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 111.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' I can't believe I'd forget something like that... I guess the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection the day after pushed everything else to the back of my mind...
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 143.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So, what was the book?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 yinshu 112.ogg}} '''Yinshu:''' The Angler Mystery. I was wondering what to do about it &mdash; I can't sell a book without a title page... But, since you asked about it, here &mdash; you can have it.
----
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 199.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Mr. Yang's instinct was right all along &mdash; Luocha is a villain! How could he do this? Tearing up a book as well-written as The Angler Mystery... Unacceptable!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did Luocha tear out the title page?
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 200.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' If I knew the answer to that, wouldn't that make me as evil as him?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Right? Outrageous!
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 144.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Calm down a moment, you two. I don't think Luocha has anything against the book.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 145.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We're forgetting that the Realm-Keeping Commission was initially investigating whether someone brought a "dangerous object" onto the Luofu.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 146.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Dahao and the others are probably not aware of what that "dangerous object" might be. But we know for a fact that it's the Stellaron.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 147.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I think that by removing the page, Luocha may have provided us with a key piece of the puzzle.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 201 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 201 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I don't understand. What does tearing out a page have to do with the Stellaron? Are you following Mr. Yang, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think so.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It might seem like a random action at first glance, but there has to be more to it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe the page will mean something to his accomplices.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 148.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Exactly. I think Luocha may have friends on the Luofu, and they're using the title page to communicate.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm lost...
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 149.ogg}} '''Welt:''' That's alright, this is a bit of a conjectural leap.
::{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 150.ogg}} '''Welt:''' What I'm trying to say is &mdash; I think Luocha may have friends on the Luofu, and they're using the title page to communicate.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 202.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That makes him even worse! How dare he use a book that praises justice for his evil plans!
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 151.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I'm afraid "evil plans" are still within the realm of speculation at this stage. We have no way of knowing exactly what he did because the cycrane data was lost.
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 203.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' So... is this a dead end?

:{{A|VO side2 lc1 welt 156.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Oh? And what do you have in mind, detective? Fieldwork?
:{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 214.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That won't be necessary, Mr. Yang. As the Angler once said: "A true detective operates as effectively from their armchair as from the scene of the crime."

::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 215.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's too early to start fieldwork &mdash; we must wait until my deduction is complete. Then, when we arrive at the scene, you'll see that the facts match my theory to a T!

::{{A|VO side2 lc1 mar7th 216.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hmph, I'll quote the Angler again: "The field officer is a diligent specimen, yet they lack the detective's instinct to deduce facts from evidence."
