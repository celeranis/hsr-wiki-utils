===Head to the Roots of the Arbor and repair its seal===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|It is the duty of the Luofu Vidyadhara to repair the Ambrosial Arbor's seal. The high elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara and the one who possesses the power of the previous high elder must shoulder this duty together before the roots of the arbor.<br />Dan Heng said he wishes to return his power to the Luofu high elder, but such powers cannot simply be borrowed or returned on a whim.}}

===Leave the Scalegorge Waterscape using Mirage Echolocation===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The Vidyadhara assassins used cloudhymn magic to conceal themselves and get close to you before attacking. As a seasoned warrior, Dan Heng is more than capable of handling himself, but Bailu is another deal, and will need your protection!<br />The Vidyadhara Mirage Echo offers active responses to both Dan Heng and Bailu. Listen to what they're saying and maybe it will help you all understand what happened all those years ago.}}

===Meet with Huanxi and leave the Scalegorge Waterscape===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Your about to arrive at the Dragonvista Rain Hall next. If all goes as expected, those hidden assassins probably won't be able to attack as they please. Of course, the expected might still be followed by the unexpected.<br />Still, even if something happens, it's not a big deal. Dan Heng's always reliable. You can always count on Dan Heng.}}

===Speak with Bailu and complete the sealing===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|With even her personal maid revealed to be a spy planted to monitor her at the behest of another authority, who else can Bailu trust? She wants to talk more with Dan Heng. Perhaps her thoughts are in disarray, or maybe she has something new in mind...<br />Frankly, if it weren't for those assassins, they should have begun talking some time ago. Well, there's no time like the present, right?}}
