{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|It is the duty of the Luofu Vidyadhara to repair the Ambrosial Arbor's seal. The high elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara and the one who possesses the power of the previous high elder must shoulder this duty together before the roots of the arbor.<br />Dan Heng said he wishes to return his power to the Luofu high elder, but such powers cannot simply be borrowed or returned on a whim.}}

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 112.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' ...Wowwww, what a magnificent sight! Is that the Ambrosial Arbor?
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 133.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Yes. Forming a seal and using their power to curb the spread of the Arbor's roots is an important task entrusted to the Luofu's high elder.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 113.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' News to me. The elders must be well aware that I'm not qualified for this position.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 114.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Which begs the question... why did Dan Feng choose me all those years ago?
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 134.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' That's exactly what I've come to Scalegorge Waterscape to find out.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 135.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Among the Vidyadhara, the high elder is the existence closest to the Permanence.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 136.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' According to historical records, the high elder succession involves a secret ritual known as the Transmutation Arcanum, as well as a treasure known as dragon heart. Once succession is complete, the former high elder undergoes a hatching rebirth, while the new high elder begins to display draconic features.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 137.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' However, Dan Feng's ritual failed, and his powers remained within me... And yet for some reason, it also created you.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 115.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' So in medical terms &mdash; he messed up the prescription... and brought suffering down on himself and just about everyone else in the process.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 138.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' I want to use this opportunity to repair the Ambrosial Arbor's seal and see if I can help recall our memories...

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 chimingH 103.ogg}} '''Twisted Voice:''' Especially you, Miss Bailu. You simply do not have the power of the High Elder &mdash; the power to summon the forces of nature... Why should I believe you are superior in any way to Master Dan Feng?
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 chimingH 104.ogg}} '''Twisted Voice:''' The Preceptors, our people... they think that the High Elder is the Vidyadhara's only savior. Arrogant, illogical! Have you seen what Merciful Medicus can do?

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 152.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' The Vidyadhara have neither parents nor family members. Once born, a teacher is assigned to instruct the young Vidyadhara in the art of cloudhymn, as well as various life skills.

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 154.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' As far back as I can remember, I've had the Preceptors and Alchemy Commission healers telling me what to do. "Cure diseases, save lives..." I don't know if that counts as "teaching..."
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 155.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' You know something? It feels like you're the teacher I've been waiting for. "Virtuous in the past life, master in the next life..." Perhaps we were friends or disciples in our previous incarnations.

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 182.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' Miss Bailu... at first I was worried that your title of high elder was in name only, and that an absence of true power would eventually put you in grave danger... It seems I was overthinking things &mdash; you have no shortage of true power.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 bailu 156.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' You mean the power to repair the seal? The power you taught me?
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 183.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' The Mirage Echoes of Scalegorge Waterscape mentioned that not only was Dan Feng a brave warrior &mdash; he could heal others with cloudhymn magic.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 danheng 184.ogg}} '''Dan Heng:''' What you have is the power of the high elder that belongs to you &mdash; the power of life that can reforge the Arbor's seal and the vitality of the eternal roots... It is a world away from my power of destruction.

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Scalegorge Waterscape|update|Your about to arrive at the Dragonvista Rain Hall next. If all goes as expected, those hidden assassins probably won't be able to attack as they please. Of course, the expected might still be followed by the unexpected.<br />Still, even if something happens, it's not a big deal. Dan Heng's always reliable. You can always count on Dan Heng.}}

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This has been a very dangerous journey...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's a good thing we managed to escape.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 huanxi 139.ogg}} '''Huanxi:''' I didn't expect those assassins to be so brazen and reckless, storming a sacred place like Scalegorge Waterscape and pursuing you... Rest assured, Miss Bailu. I'll report them to the elders and round them all up.

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 jingyuan 124.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Did the Preceptors truly believe that nobody knew of their scheme?
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 jingyuan 125.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' They should return to their senses. Attacking the Dragon Lady only destroys what little prestige they have remaining.
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 huanxi 148.ogg}} '''Huanxi:''' The whole thing was planned by me and me alone. Beware of false charges, General...
:{{A|VO side2 dh1 jingyuan 126.ogg}} '''Jing Yuan:''' Save your breath. We'll know the truth once the Cloud Knights send you to the Ten-Lords Commission's Judges.

Well, there's no time like the present, right?}}
