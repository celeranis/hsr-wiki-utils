===Compete swordsmanship with Jingliu as you vanquish abominations{{subst:void|<!--202031553-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Artisanship Commission|update|The lady, Ms. Jingliu, has been exposed by me and stopped pretending to be blind. She seems to have arrived at the Luofu to find Blade. What's more strange is her seeming closeness with the general.<br />Ms. Jingliu kept wanting me to bring her along to find Blade. As a Cloud Knight myself, how could I reveal restricted information? The lady wanted to compete with me in swordplay. Great timing. I'll have her know not to look down on the talent pool on the Luofu.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Artisanship Commission|update|I have just killed an abomination, but Ms. Jingliu has already disappeared. That was quick! I didn't see it coming. As the general's retainer, how could I lose to her? I need to hurry.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Artisanship Commission|update|This is the end of the competition, Jingliu won. She challenges me to a bout of sword fight.

I&mdash;I thought I would be the one to become the Sword Champion, but I didn't expect myself to be utterly decimated in this way.<br />In the last moment, I took her attack, her Killing Intent shook me to my core.
