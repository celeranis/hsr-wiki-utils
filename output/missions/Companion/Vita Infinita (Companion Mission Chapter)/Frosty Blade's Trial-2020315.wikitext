===Keep going, it's a race against the clock===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|I have just killed an abomination, but Ms. Jingliu has already disappeared. That was quick! I didn't see it coming. As the general's retainer, how could I lose to her? I need to hurry.}}

===Read the words left behind by Jingliu===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|This is the end of the competition, Jingliu won. She challenges me to a bout of sword fight. Every time I try to go on the offense, she would be a step ahead of me. This lady doesn't seem to be satisfied with her achievement this whole way and wanted me to take an attack from her. I&mdash;I thought I would be the one to become the Sword Champion, but I didn't expect myself to be utterly decimated in this way.<br />In the last moment, I took her attack, her Killing Intent shook me to my core. Thank the heavens, it must be because I have never slacked in my training that I managed to survive. With someone like this on the Xianzhou, I must report it to the general...}}

===Compete swordsmanship with Jingliu as you vanquish abominations===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|The lady, Ms. Jingliu, has been exposed by me and stopped pretending to be blind. She seems to have arrived at the Luofu to find Blade. What's more strange is her seeming closeness with the general.<br />Ms. Jingliu kept wanting me to bring her along to find Blade. As a Cloud Knight myself, how could I reveal restricted information? The lady wanted to compete with me in swordplay. Great timing. I'll have her know not to look down on the talent pool on the Luofu.}}
