{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Liangmu wishes you can hand the parcel he prepared for Banxia to her. Obviously, he didn't know about Banxia's passing. Keep the parcel and discuss it with the little healer about how to deal with it.<br />It can't be a love letter, can it? Better not read it in case of cringe.}}

:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 256.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' ...Ya!
:In a flash, Bailu grabs the letter, tears it to pieces, and hurls them into the air.
:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 257.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' That Liangmu is a complete scumbag &mdash; he never cared about Banxia! He only wanted to use her to get to the elixir of immortality... Why couldn't Banxia see it?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} If we'd known, we wouldn't have opened the package...
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 258.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Right... because if we'd known, it'd be in the trash by now.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's lucky Banxia didn't see the letter.

:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 260.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' That jerk better run as far as his legs will carry him! Ugh, I regret healing him so much now.
:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 261.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' ...And it makes me even angrier to think that Miss Banxia might've known what he was like to begin with, but stayed with him all the same.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No way, Liangmu must've tricked her!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Love is blind.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Only she knew the truth.
:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 262.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Grownups are so complicated! I don't understand, and I don't want to understand.
