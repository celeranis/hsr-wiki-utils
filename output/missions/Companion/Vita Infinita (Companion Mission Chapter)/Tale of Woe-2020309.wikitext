===Head to Starskiff Haven and receive Liangmu's parcel===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Liangmu wishes you can hand the parcel he prepared for Banxia to her. Obviously, he didn't know about Banxia's passing. Keep the parcel and discuss it with the little healer about how to deal with it.<br />It can't be a love letter, can it? Better not read it in case of cringe.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|You receive the parcel and want to open it with Bailu.<br />This isn't a parcel sent to either of you, but since Banxia is no longer around, look at what he wrote.}}
