{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|update|Liangmu wishes you can hand the parcel he prepared for Banxia to her. Obviously, he didn't know about Banxia's passing. Keep the parcel and discuss it with the little healer about how to deal with it.<br />It can't be a love letter, can it? Better not read it in case of cringe.}}
