:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 132.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Bandages? That's a vague description, y'know... I'm not sure. We get injured patients from all over the Xianzhou for treatment, and the number of injuries we see has skyrocketed since the Ambrosial Arbor crisis.
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 210.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' The person I'm inquiring about is tall, with a serious expression. He also carries a crude sword with him at all times. Have you seen someone like that, Dragon Lady?
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 133.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Hmm... Oh! Yes, someone came by today that matches that description!
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 134.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' He must've suffered some kind of sword wound &mdash; he had a strong scent of blood... though from the way he behaved, it must have been fairly minor. He didn't even take the medicine I prescribed.
