:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 129.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' You're... mara-struck? I don't see the symptoms in you at all. What with the incident on the Luofu, I've treated a number of mara-stricken patients recently. They all presented with signs of incoherence, delirium, or frightening physical mutations.
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 130.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' You don't seem to have any of that...
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 204.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' I made a deal that allowed me to retain what life I had left in me. I may be sane, but one thing is certain &mdash; my mind is already at its limit...

I can't help much with issues of the spirit, but the medical records do mention that calming the mind is a way to heal the body. If you're able to forget about the past, there might be a chance for your symptoms to regress.
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 206.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' Really? How unfortunate... my hatred overshadows my other emotions. I chose to hold onto it, to embrace it, and to use it to maintain my existence.
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 207.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' All I have left are the sword in my hand and my hatred of the past. If I am without either of them... I would fall into an empty void.

:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 209.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' By the way, among those you've treated in recent days, did you notice a person in bandages?
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 132.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Bandages? That's a vague description, y'know... I'm not sure. We get injured patients from all over the Xianzhou for treatment, and the number of injuries we see has skyrocketed since the Ambrosial Arbor crisis.
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 210.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' The person I'm inquiring about is tall, with a serious expression. He also carries a crude sword with him at all times. Have you seen someone like that, Dragon Lady?
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 133.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Hmm... Oh! Yes, someone came by today that matches that description!
:{{A|VO side2 jl bailu 134.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' He must've suffered some kind of sword wound &mdash; he had a strong scent of blood... though from the way he behaved, it must have been fairly minor. He didn't even take the medicine I prescribed.
:{{A|VO side2 jl jingliu 211.ogg}} '''Jingliu:''' Hm, he's probably looking for a different kind of medicine.
