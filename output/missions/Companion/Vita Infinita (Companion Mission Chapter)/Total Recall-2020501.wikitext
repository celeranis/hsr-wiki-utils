Seems like this isn't her first time helping someone with something like this.<br />As long as enough data is provided to support its calculations, deducing the past is the same as predicting the future for the Matrix of Prescience.}}

However, you are unable to go with her on this journey. You have to put your faith in Fu Xuan's skills...}}
