{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Divination Commission|update|After witnessing the wonders of the Matrix of Prescience Ultima, March 7th couldn't get the idea of using it to re-discover her past out of her head. She decides to ask for the master diviner's help with fulfilling this wish of hers.}}

:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Good morning! Is work going well today, master diviner?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 101.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' I am extremely busy of late. If you have something to ask of me, do not delay.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 102.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' You were about to say something along the lines of: "How did you know I wanted to ask something?" &mdash; but then you remembered who you were talking to and decided not to bother, correct?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You really do live up to your title.
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 103.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Of course &mdash; I run a dozen hexagrams before I even get around to breakfast. The results are never far wrong.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, the look on her face says it all, doesn't it?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 104.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' A face is not a reliable instrument of divination. On the contrary, I run a dozen hexagrams before I even get around to breakfast. The results are never far wrong.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 105.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Today's divinations threw up some unexpected complications &mdash; the hexagrammatic position was vacillating between the water and heaven trigrams. The Matrix of Prescience gave the following interpretation: "You will have three uninvited guests. This is ultimately auspicious."

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Divination Commission|update|Fu Xuan is not opposed to the request to use the Matrix of Prescience Ultima to deduce the past. Seems like this isn't her first time helping someone with something like this.<br />As long as enough data is provided to support its calculations, deducing the past is the same as predicting the future for the Matrix of Prescience.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Divination Commission|update|The preparations are complete. All that is left is for March 7th to connect with the Matrix of Prescience Ultima. Then, you will be able to use the Matrix of Prescience's outstanding calculation capacity to explore her past.<br />March 7th seems to be a little anxious, and you are rather worried, too. However, you are unable to go with her on this journey. You have to put your faith in Fu Xuan's skills...}}

:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 236.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Ugh... Miss Fu Xuan, why did the simulation just cut off like that?

::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 237.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I'm fine... Just a little light-headed is all...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What happened?
::{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 238.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I don't know. Before I could figure out what was going on, it spat me out...

:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 240.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Glowswather... you mean Fuli the Remembrance? Are they the Aeon connected to my past?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 221.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' No, it's too early to draw such a conclusion... All I can say is that it was very likely an Aeon that sealed away your memories... but not necessarily Fuli.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 222.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' When the messenger spoke of "protection," perhaps she meant the following: The Glowswather wasn't the one who sealed away your memories. THEY are interfering to shield you from these very memories.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like we came away empty-handed...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like we're still none the wiser...
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 241.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' It's not so bad... At least I know it has to do with the Garden of Recollection, right?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 223.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' It seems like retrieving memories is beyond the operational spectrum of the Matrix of Prescience Ultima.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 242.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's alright! You've helped me so much already, Master Diviner. I owe you a big one.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 224.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Mm... If you'll excuse me, I must organize an inspection of the Matrix... Ugh, fingers crossed there's no damage done.
