;(Talk to Fu Xuan With Hand on Hip)
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Miss Fu Xuan? Is that you?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mfuxuan 101.ogg}} '''Memory-Fu Xuan:''' If we want to resolve the Stellaron crisis, we must refine the question: What is the crux of the problem? Generally, it is believed that when one seizes on the crux of a problem, the problem will split open like bamboo on the edge of a knife.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mfuxuan 102.ogg}} '''Memory-Fu Xuan:''' Nobody could have foreseen the catalyzing effect of the Stellaron on the Ambrosial Arbor. As the ancients said, blessings bring about misfortune, and vice versa. Nature has its own algorithm, and it is precisely when fate wends betwixt blessing and misfortune that I, a master diviner of masterful proportions, am called on to save the people of the Luofu!
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What the heck is she talking about? Master Diviner, did you actually say that at the time? I can't remember.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 144.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' It would appear that in Miss March's estimation, I'm somewhat of a... blabbermouth.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 134.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' N&mdash;No! Uh &mdash; I've always seen you as a... m&mdash;masterful master diviner! Hehe...
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 145.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Despite the obvious distortions in this experience, the base materials from which it is composed are taken from your actual memory &mdash; there is no falsehood here. In other words, your subconscious mind thinks that I... talk in tongue-twisters.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hahaha... Uh, &mdash; it's mainly just that I, uh... can't always comprehend the... lofty ideals and, uh... principles you discuss...
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 146.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' Forget it, now is not the time for losing one's temper.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 147.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' If the inferred experience is distorted, we should focus on filtering out each distortion one by one &mdash; otherwise we won't be able to trace your memories back any further.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 136.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Umm, this is getting a little complicated... Is there a... simpler explanation?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 148.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' *sigh* Draw your bow and fire an arrow at that Fu Xuan.

:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 151.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? Which next fight?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mwelt 102.ogg}} '''Memory-Welt:''' Stay focused. Phantylia is headed for the Ambrosial Arbor &mdash; if we don't stop the Lord Ravager, it'll be a catastrophe.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 152.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Okay, alright. Got it.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mwelt 103.ogg}} '''Memory-Welt:''' Another thing... The future is what's most important for us. Don't you agree, March?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 153.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mwelt 104.ogg}} '''Memory-Welt:''' Dwelling on memories can numb your sense of the present, and inhibit future ambitions.
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 mar7th 154.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Miss Fu Xuan, do people in memories always say weird stuff like this?
:{{A|VO side2 fx1 fuxuan 160.ogg}} '''Fu Xuan:''' The distortions we're experiencing are... unorthodox.
