===Meet up with Dan Heng at Synwood Pavilion{{subst:void|<!--202060102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|The wanderer, once meant to be permanently exiled, has returned to the Luofu. Dan Heng, determined to face his past, has invited you to join him in meeting the high elder of the Vidyadhara.<br />You never expected "Cold Dragon Young" to talk much about his own affairs, so this might be a rare chance. Finish this homecoming adventure and show off what you reaped to March 7th after.}}

===Find the Ferryman and head to the Alchemy Commission delve together{{subst:void|<!--202060103-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Exalting Sanctum|update|Dan Heng's homecoming seems to be a big ordeal, requiring notice to be delivered to the Luofu's Six Charioteers and the Vidyadhara elders... Seeing as Dan Heng already made travel arrangements, you should go with him. It won't do for you to just use a Space Anchor to teleport to the Alchemy Commission alone.<br />Dan Heng never intended to conceal his Vidyadhara heritage, and this might explain why he possesses such a magnanimous demeanor nowadays. Yet, the Vidyadhara's attitude towards his return remains to be seen...}}

===Request an audience with the high elder and meet the messenger{{subst:void|<!--202060111-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Alchemy Commission|update|It seems the way home isn't comprised of polite greetings but people urging Dan Heng to turn back. Perhaps his return to the Xianzhou Luofu might not be the happiest affair...<br />Seeing how many people can recognize him with the barest mention, this might have to do with his revealed identity. This doesn't seem like something the usually circumspect Dan Heng is used to.}}

===Speak with Huanxi and head to the Scalegorge Waterscape{{subst:void|<!--202060115-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Alchemy Commission|update|After dealing with those arrogant assassins, Dan Heng decides to ignore the Vidyadhara Preceptors' invitation and head to Scalegorge Waterscape directly with the messenger to meet the young high elder.<br />You don't know many Vidyadhara, so you're not sure whether it's normal for so many people to care about the whereabouts of the high elder. Dan Heng's presence is like a rock striking ripples across the water.}}
