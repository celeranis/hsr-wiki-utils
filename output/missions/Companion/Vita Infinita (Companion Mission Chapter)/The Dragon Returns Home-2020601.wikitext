:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you here about the high elder succession, too?
::{{A|VO side2 dh1 luying 106.ogg}} '''Luying:''' Certainly! Miss Bailu has weathered nothing but criticism since she was granted the title, but the Alchemy Commission firmly believes that girl to be a precious diamond in the rough. She is compassionate, kind, and a hundred times better than Dan Feng.
::{{A|VO side2 dh1 luying 107.ogg}} '''Luying:''' Moreover, Dan Feng selected her as high elder, making her the leader of the Luofu Vidyadhara. Fate chose her as our sovereign, and we bowed down before that destiny.
::{{A|VO side2 dh1 luying 108.ogg}} '''Luying:''' Now that you're back, everything has changed. The Preceptors are starting to think of finding other candidates, which means nothing but trouble for Miss Bailu.

:{{A|VO side2 dh1 luying 109.ogg}} '''Luying:''' You may have a clear conscience, but even so... As long as you remain on the Luofu, invisible forces will try to coerce you. Leave now. It's the best outcome for everyone involved.
