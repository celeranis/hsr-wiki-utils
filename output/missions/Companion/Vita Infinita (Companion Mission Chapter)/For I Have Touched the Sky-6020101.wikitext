:{{A|VO side2 yk1 welt 145.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Hehe, y'know, there are lot of "mung bean soda moments" in life &mdash; if you don't try you won't know. Unique experiences are often a product of risky choices.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 137.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' Ha, tell that to my mom. Her number one life lesson is: "You can't turn back once you enter the sky. Pilots are always dancing with death."
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 138.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' I know she's right &mdash; I know being a fighter pilot is an exhausting and dangerous job... but I still want to fly among the stars &mdash; to fight for the Xianzhou Alliance across the vast galaxy...
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 welt 146.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Why are you so dedicated to that idea, Miss Qingni?
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 139.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' Have you heard of the foxian "birthfate" tradition? Soon after a child is born, we surround them with items that represent future destinies.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 140.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' If the child reaches for a jade abacus, then they'll grow up to be a diviner. If they reach for a sword, then they'll grow up to be a famous warrior. And if they reach for a toy starskiff...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They'll become a toy salesman?
::{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 141.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' What? No... It means they'll become a pilot.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They'll become a starskiff pilot?
::{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 142.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' That's right!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you reached for the starskiff?
::{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 143.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' No, not me... My genius mom did...
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 144.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' Mom reached for the starskiff and showed a natural talent for flying. General Jing Yuan recruited her to the Cloud Knights as soon as she was old enough &mdash; that's how she became a fighter pilot.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 145.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' Later, she achieved miracles... One time, she destroyed three beast ships in a hail of borisin anti-aircraft fire &mdash; like an arrow tearing through a thunderstorm... She also holds the Sky-Faring Commission records for speed and enemy vessels destroyed.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 146.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' I'm proud to be Madam Yukong's daughter. I've wanted to become a legend like her for as long as I can remember.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 welt 147.ogg}} '''Welt:''' I can imagine. A parent is often a child's first hero, and their image can influence their whole life.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 147.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' *sigh* She never told me any of those stories herself, and she hasn't piloted a starskiff since the Third Denizens of Abundance War. She doesn't even bring up her military achievements.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 148.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' I used to watch her fly when I was young... then one time, I stole a starskiff and I tried all kinds of difficult maneuvers. Turns out I was as talented as she was. Not only did I survive the flight, my landing was perfect.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 149.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' I remember feeling so happy when they took me to see Mom &mdash; there I was boasting about the flight, expecting her to laugh, pat my head, say "that's my girl" or something. But boy, I've never seen her so scary...
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 150.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' I admit, I deserved to be punished &mdash; you can't let a kid get away with stealing a starskiff... but my Mom was angry about more than that. She was angry because I viewed her as a role model &mdash; because I had the same talent as her. I don't understand it.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 welt 148.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Parents never want their children to be in danger. I think I can understand Madam Yukong.
:{{A|VO side2 yk1 qingni 151.ogg}} '''Qingni:''' But... flying is the only thing I want to do. I've already touched the sky.
