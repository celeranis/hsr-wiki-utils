===Follow the Diting and find the clue===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|With March 7th's translation, you understand that the Diting found some strange clues in the Cloudford dock. Not a buried treasure... You sigh wordlessly. If you can do it over, you wouldn't have beckoned to the puppy. Looks like you're on a trip to Cloudford now...}}

===Help the Diting that seems to want something===

You arrive at the Starskiff Haven to find a homeless little dog whimpering as if asking for help. Playing with homeless animals isn't your favorite pastime, but what if this little dog wants you to dig out a treasure buried somewhere? What if that's the case?}}
