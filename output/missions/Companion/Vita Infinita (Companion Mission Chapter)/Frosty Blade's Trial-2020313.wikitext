{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Chaos reigned on the Xianzhou ship, even cats and dogs have become restless. You arrive at the Starskiff Haven to find a homeless little dog whimpering as if asking for help. Playing with homeless animals isn't your favorite pastime, but what if this little dog wants you to dig out a treasure buried somewhere? What if that's the case?}}
