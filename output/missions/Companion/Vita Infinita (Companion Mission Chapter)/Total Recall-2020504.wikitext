===Follow Dan Heng and explore your own memory{{subst:void|<!--202050402-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Memory-Herta Space Station|update|It isn't surprising to see Dan Heng in this memory, but March 7th is rather startled to see him acting in a way that screams "there's no time to explain. Hurry and get onto the Express!"<br />This isn't too bad. Having a guide is better than her searching alone aimlessly in her memories.}}

===Find the "surreal" part of this memory{{subst:void|<!--202050405-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Memory-Herta Space Station|update|Fu Xuan left a word of warning, then completely cut off communications with March 7th. March is a little scared, but this fear also made her feel a little ridiculous &mdash; why is everything so ominous and lonely when this is her own memory?<br />She can't help but recall the nightmare she had a few nights ago. She forgot the content of the dream as soon as she woke up, but that helpless and isolated feeling of fear lasted for well over an hour.}}

===Find the "abnormality" in this memory{{subst:void|<!--202050411-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Memory-Herta Space Station|update|After overcoming various obstacles, March 7th finally approaches the starting point of her memories. However, the closer she gets, the more anxious she feels &mdash; Where is this "obstacle" coming from?<br />Fu Xuan's warning echoes in her mind, making her almost wanting to stop and turn back the way she came...<br />"But Trailblazers must never turn back, even when they turn their back." March 7th is pretty satisfied with this dry joke and decides to tell it to Dan Heng when she gets back.}}
