{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Central Starskiff Haven|Ever since March 7th became a disciple of Yanqing and Yunli, you notice she's practically bubbling with excitement like a kid at summer camp. You've also been missing her on the Express. But all enthusiasm will eventually dampen, and by then, she'll realize that swordplay training isn't child's play.<br />March 7th should be practicing in the backyard now. Check in on her as you deem fit to see if her passion has faded at all.}}

::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 132.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' So, it really is a baseball bat.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 133.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Grandpa said that a sword doesn't have to be constrained by its shape, so in a sense, your bat is a sword too. He also said that a weapon mimics its master, so your bat actually reflects your habits and nature, you know?
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 134.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Let me guess, you're someone who... doesn't follow the rules, enjoys improvising, and can handle yourself well against tough foes. Am I right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you been secretly filming me?
:::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 135.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Amazing, right? And I bet you always say something silly like "Rules are made to be broken."

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Oh, you're mistaken. I always follow the rules.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 136.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Oh, really? But I never guess wrong.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 137.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I've come across so many sword wielders who acted all righteous and moral but were really just liars. Their swords always told the truth though. They told me that their wielders were just a bunch of frauds who relied on their divine weapons for everything.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 138.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I've hunted down hundreds of swords like this so far, and every single one of them has been melted down!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait, you take people's swords by force and melt them down?
:::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 139.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Yes, but only for those who cross the line. Melting their swords is my way of protecting those weapons.
:::But what if you make a mistake?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} But what if you make a mistake?
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 140.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Swords are more honest than words. It's much easier to judge a sword than to judge someone's words, so I rarely make mistakes.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 141.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' But just looking at a sword is not enough. Grandpa always says, words and expressions can be deceiving, but in a fight to the death, a sword's movements never lie... The Wardance is just around the corner. You'll be participating, right?
::{{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 101.ogg}} '''???:''' Miss Yunli, for talented swordmasters like you, the Wardance is a perfect opportunity to show off your skills and make a name for yourself.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 102 f.ogg}} '''Xikui:''' But for people like (Trailblazer) who have already made significant contributions to the Xianzhou, they maybe don't need to prove themselves on the Wardance stage.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is Madam Yukong's secretary.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 105 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 105 f.ogg}} '''Xikui:''' Thank you for your introduction, (Trailblazer). I'm Xikui, and I work in the Palace of Astrum as the secretary for the Helm Master.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 106 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 106 f.ogg}} '''Xikui:''' I apologize for interrupting your conversation. I happened to hear you discussing the Wardance, and since (Trailblazer) is an old acquaintance, I thought I'd come and say hello.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you hosting any guests, Miss Xikui?
::{{A|VO side2 yunli xikui 107.ogg}} '''Xikui:''' Yes, with the Wardance approaching, many guests from afar are pouring in. Mr. Paavo here is one of them. He's from the distant planet Kalevala.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, it's like being possessed by a heliobus?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 179.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Oh, so you're familiar with heliobi? That makes this much easier to explain.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 180.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' There was a lunatic swordsmith who infused metal blades with heliobi, as he was obsessed with turning weapons into living things, and this is how cursed swords were made.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, Guyun is one of those cursed swords?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, your father sealed a heliobus inside that sword?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 181.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I know I shouldn't have caused a scene at the Sword-Gifting Ceremony, but I've thought this through. If I don't make a fuss now, that cursed sword will cause a whole lot more trouble. So, it's better if it's me causing the trouble.

:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 109.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Yes, I did. As Idrila's knight, I've sworn to live in poverty, and I abhor theft. I had to leave behind a rose petal in order to keep my promise to Master Guyun and uphold my knightly oath.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 259.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 110.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' I agreed to assist Master Guyun in its escape from the Xianzhou. As the person who pulled it from the stone monument, captivated by its beauty, I must not let it down.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 111.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' I couldn't stay in the arsenal to convince the craftsmen, nor did I want to take the sword like a thief. That's why I left behind a small piece of evidence that pointed to my identity in the hope of an open and honest conversation with you.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 260.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Whatever your reasons are, you're planning to take the cursed sword away from the Xianzhou! Hand it over to me!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 112.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Back then, it was the beauty of Master Guyun that impressed me, so I willingly embarked on the journey to return the sword... But unfortunately, Master Guyun's homeland is no longer the ideal place for it to return to. As a Knight of Beauty, I must not abandon it halfway.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 261.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Oh, no. He's completely captivated by the power of that cursed sword.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How can we snap him out of it?
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 262.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' The solution is right in your hand.
::It's like a devil that can mess with your mind.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's like a devil that can mess with your mind.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 263.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That's what makes cursed swords so scary.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 113.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Captivated? No, I am touched by Master Guyun's flawless beauty!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 114.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' To be honest, I'm confused why none of you can understand this sword. This is quite heartrending... I've already made up my mind to take Master Guyun away from the Xianzhou.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 264.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That cursed sword has messed with your ability to think, but I'll break you free from its grip! I'll shatter its illusion... and the sword itself!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 115.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Fair lady, if you're intent on taking away this person... this sword that is under my protection, please engage me with a fair duel according to knightly etiquette.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 116.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' As a representative in this duel, I, Argenti, challenge you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A representative?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 117.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' I swear on the spirit of chivalry, in front of Idrila the Beauty, that I will represent Master Guyun in this duel.
:{{tx}}
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 121.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' I've lost. According to the rules of a knight's duel, I should keep my promise and hand over the sword to you.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 122.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' But before I do that, I hope that you, as the winner, might have mercy and listen to Master Guyun's past experiences...
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 269.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' This sword has been cursed since the day it was forged. Place it in front of me, and let me destroy it!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli guyun 101.ogg}} '''???:''' Do what she says, Knight.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 123.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' But...
:{{A|VO side2 yunli guyun 102.ogg}} '''???:''' You've done so much for me already. It's time for me to face her alone.
:Argenti draws forth an ancient sword, scarred from countless battles. Before all eyes, the blade rises slowly, its edge dancing with the semblance of flames.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli guyun 103.ogg}} '''Guyun:''' I'm weary of fighting. I just want to share my past with you, to explain why I wanted to escape.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli guyun 104.ogg}} '''Guyun:''' After that, I'll leave my destiny in your hands. Are you afraid to witness my past, little girl?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 270.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Afraid? Well, you do have a different aura from other cursed swords, but you're just trying to use my curiosity to lure me in.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli guyun 105.ogg}} '''Guyun:''' Well, you know best that a single touch won't snatch away anyone's sanity.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Just be careful, Yunli.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think it's worth a shot, Yunli.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 271.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...

:The knight understands the rules of knightly duels. He ceases arguing and instead eagerly awaits for you and Yunli to listen to Guyun's past.

;(Talk to Guyun)


:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 124.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' ...I've told you everything about my experience with Master Guyun on Kalevala. And now, I'm sure that Miss Yunli is as moved by the sword's flawless beauty as I was back then.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli huaiyan 155.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Even though I had heard the legends of this sword from the delegation, delving into its memories was still fascinating. Yunli, I trust Guyun's experiences have changed your mind.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 283.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I had no idea that this sword had such a past.
::{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 284.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' It wasn't until I held Guyun in my hands that I could sense its thoughts and unspoken words.
::General Huaiyan said this sword would change you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} General Huaiyan said this sword would change you.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 285.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' That's why Grandpa hid it from me, so I wouldn't make a hasty decision...
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 286.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' I always thought... a cursed sword infused with a heliobus would only bring rage and slaughter. I never thought someone could leave behind the desire to end war and even change the nature of the cursed sword.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 287.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' My position was too extreme. Guyun is truly a Sword of Heroes. I... I apologize to all of you for my behavior.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 288.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' ...I'm sorry!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli dahao 142.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Now that we've proven Miss Yunli's innocence and found the sword, should we now return it to the arsenal?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 289.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' No, I'm still going to melt down this sword!
:{{A|VO side2 yunli huaiyan 156.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' ...
:{{A|VO side2 yl argenti 124.ogg}} '''Argenti & Dahao:''' ...!?

;(Talk to Yunli)

:{{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 306 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 yunli yunli 306 f.ogg}} '''Yunli:''' Thank you for your guidance, (Trailblazer). I'm truly grateful... By any chance, would you be interested in taking sword lessons with me, like March?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe not, I have my baseball bat...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Thanks, but no thanks. I don't think I can endure the hardship.

;(Talk to Argenti)
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 127.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' As a punishment for being an "accomplice" in the theft, General Huaiyan assigned me to guard this golden sapling and recite the story of the hero and this legendary sword to passers-by.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 128.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' This is not a punishment at all, and I gladly accepted it! Spreading the message of Beauty to the Xianzhou residents is exactly what I desire.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli argenti 129.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' However, I plan to leave the Xianzhou soon and continue my travels. May our paths cross again in the vast Cosmos, my dear friend.

:{{A|VO side2 yunli huaiyan 166.ogg}} '''Huaiyan:''' Well, my granddaughter was inspired by the heroic legends told by the Miekka Kivessä, so she dragged me here to take a look.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's this golden sapling...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you choose this place?
:{{A|VO side2 yunli pawoer 134.ogg}} '''Paavo:''' I come from a long line of Kalevalan monument keepers. For generations, my family has guarded the stone monument left behind by the nameless hero.

:{{A|VO side2 yunli pawoer 140.ogg}} '''Paavo:''' Now that my mission is accomplished, the delegation will be leaving the Xianzhou Luofu soon. But of course, the experiences here will become an epilogue to the hero's stories.
:{{A|VO side2 yunli pawoer 141.ogg}} '''Paavo:''' This golden sapling will become a part of the everyday scenery of the Xianzhou. I believe it's what he would have wanted.
