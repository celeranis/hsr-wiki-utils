===Ask the Cloud Knight Captain about Cloudford's current situation===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|When the general called the prisoner, Blade, to court, I knew. The Shackling Prison would never be able to trap someone like him. He looks at everyone as if they were all as dead as those in a cemetery. It was a look that only assassins who have been macerating in death can give... His prison break was for a certain goal. What can it be?<br />The hunt for Blade stopped at Cloudford. The general is busy with official matters, as his retainer, I should take part of this responsibility for him.}}

===Head to the Cloudford dock===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|O Yanqing, you had not considered one thing. If the wanted man wants a starskiff, he needs only to find the navigator array at the dock to check records of starskiffs. As for what he did at Cloudford, what does it matter?}}

===Make the Diting track down the wanted man and ascertain his direction===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|In the process of searching in Cloudford, I found several Mara-struck corpses. The wounds left on the bodies were not caused by Cloud Knight weapons... If my deduction is accurate, the wanted man would have escaped from a nearby dock.}}

===Escort Jingliu===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|When I follow the sword marks, a lady was trapped by several Mara-struck monsters. Odd, with the Cloud Knights locking the port, why are there travelers being stuck here? She would be in danger traveling alone, I should escort her to safety before completing my mission. It's a shame that her eyes are covered with a black cloth, so she won't be able to see my graceful swordsmanship.}}

===Investigate the navigator array for the location of the starskiff that Blade took===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|This Stellaron crisis is evidently puppeteered by someone. The villain I accosted along the way could control abominations! Thankfully, my swordplay is adequate to dispatch them all. What was interesting, is the lady could tell who I am just from listening to the sound of my sword-wielding. After checking the navigator array, I have to test her.}}

===Find clues at Cloudford===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|No one could ingress or egress the Xianzhou ship without a starskiff. A wanted person would only linger here to hijack a starskiff to escape, so he would have left behind clues. But as the only Xianzhou opening to the cast expanse, Cloudford contains more than thousands of belongings of visitors. You can't check them out one by one, can you?}}
