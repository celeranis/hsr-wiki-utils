===Ask the Cloud Knight Captain about Cloudford's current situation{{subst:void|<!--202031401-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|When the general called the prisoner, Blade, to court, I knew. The Shackling Prison would never be able to trap someone like him. He looks at everyone as if they were all as dead as those in a cemetery. It was a look that only assassins who have been macerating in death can give... His prison break was for a certain goal. What can it be?<br />The hunt for Blade stopped at Cloudford. The general is busy with official matters, as his retainer, I should take part of this responsibility for him.}}
