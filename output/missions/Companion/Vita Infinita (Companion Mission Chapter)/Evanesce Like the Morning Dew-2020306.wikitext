===Go to the first meet-up point===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|One is an obsessed nurse, and the other a patient seeking medicine. She bumped into him too many times to say that it isn't destiny. Help Banxia treat her sweetheart and put this saga to rest.<br />Find the Outworlder wanted by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Hopefully he's hanging on.}}

===Search for clues left by the patient within the area===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|As the journey goes on, Banxia's Mara-struck symptoms begin to emerge. Her sweetheart is nowhere to be seen, maybe clues can be found nearby.<br />Maybe that person got into some trouble, both the Cloud Knights and Disciples of Sanctus Medicus would never let him off the hook.}}

===Follow the clues and go to the next meet-up point===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|One is an obsessed nurse, and the other a patient seeking medicine. She bumped into him too many times to say that it isn't destiny. Meet up with him at the next location.<br />There are more and more Disciples of Sanctus Medicus around, be careful.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Bypass the Cloud Knights and go to the next meet-up point===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You got misidentified as a lost citizen by the Ten-Lords Commission, fortunately Banxia's Mara-struck symptoms were not exposed. Move on.<br />Banxia is on her last straw, but she should still have a chance to see her loved one a final time.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Look around for and change into Cloud Knights' armor===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|It's not the greatest idea, but it's an idea. Go look for Cloud Knights' equipment.<br />The armor is tightly sealed, no one would be able to tell the species and gender expression of an individual wearing them, what a find.}}

===Impersonate a Cloud Knight and go pass the checkpoint===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Banxia's mara symptoms are acting up, help her get there slowly===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Banxia seems to be at her limits, but you understand clearly that she shouldn't stop now. Hopefully her sweetheart is there waiting for her.<br />Based on your limited experience, not many can keep their sanity intact like Banxia at this stage.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Step aside, let Banxia "come alone"===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You reach the destination, but the cautious Liangmu insists to have Banxia "come alone," so you should step aside for a while.<br />There's no time to argue about it, so just trust Banxia for this.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Check out what happened to Banxia===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You hear cries for help, it was a man's voice. Go and help him out.<br />Is that man Banxia's lover, Liangmu?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Continue and look for Banxia's sweetheart===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|No matter what, the goal of your trip is to complete your deal with Banxia &mdash; having Bailu cure Banxia's lover. Go look for him.<br />He might have left because he was scared of the Mara-struck monsters, but this will cause him lifelong regret.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Lead the man to find Banxia's body===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|Evidently, Liangmu didn't know the Mara-struck soldier was Banxia, but he was still eager to return to her side.<br />You don't know the story between them, but at least this tells you he was a loyal person...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Give Bailu the clues you found===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You found a notebook. Give it to Bailu, then formulate a plan.<br />It looks like Banxia's sweetheart was tracked by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and had to switch location.}}
