{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|One is an obsessed nurse, and the other a patient seeking medicine. She bumped into him too many times to say that it isn't destiny. Help Banxia treat her sweetheart and put this saga to rest.<br />Find the Outworlder wanted by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus. Hopefully he's hanging on.}}

===Search for clues left by the patient within the area{{subst:void|<!--202030603-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|As the journey goes on, Banxia's Mara-struck symptoms begin to emerge. Her sweetheart is nowhere to be seen, maybe clues can be found nearby.<br />Maybe that person got into some trouble, both the Cloud Knights and Disciples of Sanctus Medicus would never let him off the hook.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|You found a notebook. Give it to Bailu, then formulate a plan.<br />It looks like Banxia's sweetheart was tracked by the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus and had to switch location.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|You got misidentified as a lost citizen by the Ten-Lords Commission, fortunately Banxia's Mara-struck symptoms were not exposed.

===Look around for and change into Cloud Knights' armor{{subst:void|<!--202030611-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|It's not the greatest idea, but it's an idea. Go look for Cloud Knights' equipment.<br />The armor is tightly sealed, no one would be able to tell the species and gender expression of an individual wearing them, what a find.}}

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|You reach the destination, but the cautious Liangmu insists to have Banxia "come alone," so you should step aside for a while.<br />There's no time to argue about it, so just trust Banxia for this.}}

===Continue and look for Banxia's sweetheart{{subst:void|<!--202030626-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|No matter what, the goal of your trip is to complete your deal with Banxia &mdash; having Bailu cure Banxia's lover. Go look for him.<br />He might have left because he was scared of the Mara-struck monsters, but this will cause him lifelong regret.}}

===Lead the man to find Banxia's body{{subst:void|<!--202030627-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Cloudford|update|Evidently, Liangmu didn't know the Mara-struck soldier was Banxia, but he was still eager to return to her side.<br />You don't know the story between them, but at least this tells you he was a loyal person...}}
