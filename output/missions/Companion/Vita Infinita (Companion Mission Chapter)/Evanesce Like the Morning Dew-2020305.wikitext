::'''Dahao:''' I always feel like we're missing something here at the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery, but I can never remember what. You've come at just the right time &mdash; help me rule out some possibilities. Say, tell me, what do you think our office is missing?
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Promo materials showcasing the work of the Realm-Keeping Commission.
:::'''Dahao:''' Not that...
:::'''Dahao:''' I raised this with Jingyan before, whether we should be better at promoting how good the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery is at what it does. But she gave me a list of all the things we've done recently, and there isn't really anything to be proud of.
:::'''Dahao:''' Once we crack a major case that even the Ten-Lords Commission can't solve, then I'll let the whole Exalting Sanctum know about how great the Realm-Keeping Commission is... Until then, we'll keep things on the down-low.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} Small ornaments that make this place feel alive.
:::'''Dahao:''' Make the place feel alive... Actually, I've thought about that.
:::'''Dahao:''' I'm a big fan of alcoholic nectar and once stashed two bottles of Nectar of Willow Woods at the Chancery, but Officer Jingyan threw them out. She said this is the workplace and it would be undignified if anyone found out.
:::'''Dahao:''' I also like pretty foxian actresses, so I've put up a couple of their pictures on my desk to perk up my spirits. But Officer Jingyan confiscated those too. She said this is the workplace and those images are indecent.
:::'''Dahao:''' *sigh* The only way the Realm-Keeping Commission feels alive is through all the courier parcels on the ground.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} A Realm-Keeping Commission Officer who is actually productive at work.
:::'''Dahao:''' {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young man}}, that remark is uncalled for. At least Officer Jingyan is doing her work. As long as Officer Jingyan is here, then the Realm-Keeping Commission lives up to its name.
:::'''Dahao:''' That Songyan kid may be lazy, but he's smart. I have high hopes for his future.
:::'''Dahao:''' Naturally, if anything actually happens to Exalting Sanctum, you'll find me to be an extremely reliable officer.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is now really the time to be thinking about that?
:::'''Dahao:''' Yeah, I can't figure it out even if I rack my brain. I think I'll play a few rounds of Celestial Jade after work and think it through then.
:::'''Dahao:''' Alright, let's get down to business. {{MC|f=Young lady|m=Young man}}, what do you want?

::'''Jingyan:''' One second.
::'''Jingyan:''' Alright. I'm Jingyan from the Realm-Keeping Commission, and I'm in charge of general affairs here. Is there anything that I can help you with?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What can you help me with?
:::'''Jingyan:''' ...I was just asking you that, but you asked me the same thing. Okay.
:::'''Jingyan:''' Household registrations, applications, and maintenance for local Xianzhou citizens. Handling of cases such as fighting, wounding with a weapon, theft, robbery. Processing census data, demographic statistics, resource allocation...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I get it. Please stop this monotonous chanting.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Looks like you aren't really that interested in the work of Realm-Keeping Commission officers.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Yes, you've all done a great job.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Ah, so you're here to inspect our work then? Thank you for taking the time to visit our humble Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery.
::::'''Jingyan:''' But I'm afraid it's currently during business hours, so please do not interrupt our everyday consultations.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've been cyber-scammed!
:::'''Jingyan:''' Cyber-scammed? We don't differentiate between scams happening online or offline here.
:::'''Jingyan:''' Please register your contact details, how the scammer contacted you, how you were scammed, and how much you were scammed out of? Go fill this out, and I'll verify your account for you.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, I wasn't scammed at all.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Hmm. It's still currently during business hours, so please do not cause any trouble for our busy officers.
::::'''Jingyan:''' Based on my experience, you don't really look like a victim of scamming.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Th&mdash;There's no transaction record on the account.
::::'''Jingyan:''' This is a bit of a hassle. Not even the Realm-Keeping Commission can get back your "money that wasn't scammed."
::::'''Jingyan:''' Seems like you'll have to sort that part out on your own. Our hands are tied here at the Realm-Keeping Commission.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I don't think I have anything that's connected to general affairs.
::'''Jingyan:''' Excuse me, do you have anything else?

;(Talk to Songyan)
;(If {{cx}}<!--during performance 502033101-->)
::'''Songyan:''' Ah~ If the Realm-Keeping Commission could give me the cash directly and let me stay at home all day without doing this troublesome job, that'd be great.
::'''Songyan:''' Anyway, it doesn't matter what I do or not do, the results are always gonna be the same. Why not cut out this middle part...
::'''Songyan:''' Hm? Eavesdropping is rude, {{MC|f=lady|m=sir}}, you know. What's up? If it's something important, please go to Official Dahao, and for literally anything else, please approach Officer Jingyan.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} So... You just don't deal with anything?
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the Realm-Keeping Commission's Most Intelligent, and I only show up when those two get stuck. In other words, I'm the Ultimate Trump Card. Do you lead with your ace when you're playing tiles?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's only three officers staffing this tiny Chancery...
::::'''Songyan:''' What about it? There can be a trump card hidden among three people.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're just spouting nonsense, aren't you?
::::'''Songyan:''' There's a saying. "Of three people, one will be a slacker." If I call dibs on slacking off, then the other two can't.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What issues would you be handling normally?
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the kind of person who hates inconvenience. If you have any kind of work that's not too tiring, not too troublesome &mdash; then I'm down for that.
:::'''Songyan:''' I'm the Realm-Keeping Commission's Most Intelligent, and I only show up when those two get stuck. Just look at those two, and I'm mainly talking about the Officer Jingyan here &mdash; still going at it so hard, so I don't have to.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I just so happen to have a really thorny problem that I could use your help with...
::::'''Songyan:''' No no no, any thorny problem should be handed over to Jingyan. She's the main backbone of the Realm-Keeping Commission.
::::'''Songyan:''' Have you heard of this saying before? "With little power comes little responsibility." The little refers to me.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm going to tell Officer Jingyan right now.
::::'''Songyan:''' Doesn't matter, mate. A person like her is born to work hard, and she never trusts what I do. Also, every time when there are "outstanding troubles" to deal with, she'll just complete it for me, personally.
::::'''Songyan:''' So telling her anything would just be adding to her troubles. I urge you not to do this.
::'''Songyan:''' *sigh* {{MC|f=Miss|m=My man}}, put aside your judgmental look. I've put in the hours working long and hard before, and I was, once upon a time, considered an elite officer of the General Affairs.
::'''Songyan:''' Besides, why do I work at the Realm-Keeping Commission? If it weren't for my failed investments... With all the curves on the chart going down, and only the prices are going up. Working has become a necessary option.
::'''Songyan:''' I hustled, and I failed. Now, this is the best effort I can put into work right now.
::'''Songyan:''' Hey, don't leave just yet. As long as we're chatting here, there won't be any new tasks assigned to me. Let's chat a little longer, {{MC|f=miss|m=sir}}.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you alright?
:::'''Battuta:''' Haha, they've already given me meds, so I'll just rest and recover...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Your body looks healthy. What's all this about...

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who are you?
:::'''Battuta:''' I'm Battuta. I used to be a judge in the Klimt Republic. My side job was a travel writer... But now, I'm just a criminal waiting around for the Sky-Faring Commission to repatriate me...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you doing here?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Earned her trust? When did that happen?
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 102.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' You rescued her from the mara-struck... I'd say she's forever in your debt.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 103.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' If you go see her, I'm sure she won't run away.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do people here keep making me run errands?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Okay, I'll do it!
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 105.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Hah, that was fast! Thanks for your help.
:{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 106.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Here's the situation: Lady Bailu, the Vidyadhara Dragon Lady, has escaped from the Alchemy Commission again. I say "again" because the Realm-Keeping Commission has seen more than a few of her bad-tempered escapes.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Vidyadhara?
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 107.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' This must be your first time on the Xianzhou... It's a long story. The Vidyadhara is one of the three races that established the Xianzhou Alliance.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 108.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Their bloodline is different from us Xianzhou natives. The Vidyadhara are born with great vitality, the gift of the Permanence, as they say.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 109.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' That's all you need to know. The rest is irrelevant to what's happening today.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What does a Dragon Lady do exactly?
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 110.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' A Dragon Lady... isn't an official position. People address her that way out of love.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 111.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' The Vidyadhara "high elder," on the other hand, is a position similar to a chief &mdash; it's been passed down from generation to generation. But only the Vidyadhara that possess draconic features and inherit the dragon heart can be successors.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 112.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' And Miss Bailu is the Vidyadhara's future high elder on the Luofu.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 113.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' The rumor has always been that she can heal the wounded merely by touching them and shedding tears. She also studied medicine in the Alchemy Commission. That's why her other title is "Healer Lady."
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} She escaped? Was she imprisoned?
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 114.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Not imprisoned exactly... Vidyadhara customs are somewhat different from Xianzhou native customs. Miss Bailu has incredible talents and is next in line to rule over the Vidyadhara &mdash; it's normal that her people would want to keep a close eye on her.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 115.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' However, she also has a somewhat free spirit... She always manages to find a way to escape her residence.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm listening.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 116.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' It used to be the duty of the Realm-Keeping Commission to go after her and take her back to the Alchemy Commission.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 117.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' But, this time is different. Because of the Stellaron crisis, we're constantly short of manpower. Besides, even if we catch the Dragon Lady, we can't take her back anytime soon.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 118.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' I don't know if you heard &mdash; someone locked down the delves connected to the Alchemy Commission.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 119.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Now nobody can get in or out &mdash; it's completely cut off. Something very fishy is going on.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} So how did the Dragon Lady get out?
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 120.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' That's what I want to know. I guess she sneaked out before the delves were locked down. She might even know what happened in the Alchemy Commission...
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Talk}} But I saw doctors...
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 121.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Those doctors came from apothecaries in other delves. I've asked them, and they don't have the slightest clue what's going on.
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Then... is there really anything I can do?
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 122.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' I'd like you to help with two things. First, find the Dragon Lady and take care of her until the Alchemy Commission delves are reopened. Don't lose sight of her.
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 123.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' The second thing might be a bit hard to understand... I want you to stop her from treating the mara-struck.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Can't the Realm-Keeping Commission take care of her?
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 124.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Like I said &mdash; we don't have enough people! The Dragon Lady is smart. If we try to keep her in the Realm-Keeping Commission Chancery, she'll sneak out the first chance she gets. Trust me, it's happened before...
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 125.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Besides, it isn't a crime for her to run away from her residence. And even if it were, given her status, we couldn't exactly stick her in jail and throw away the key! You're the only person we can turn to.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Why stop her from treating the mara-struck?
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 126.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Being stricken with mara isn't like catching a curable disease. All the Healer Lady can do is slow the process.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not a disease?
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 127.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Take you short-life species as an example. Do you consider aging a disease?
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 128.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Aging can be slowed, but it's still unavoidable &mdash; just like being stricken with mara for the people of the Xianzhou... Unfortunately, becoming mara-struck is more terrifying than death. It's an inevitable curse in the blood of Xianzhou natives.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} Then, what can be done for them?
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 129.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' The Xianzhou has long had other methods. When mara is about to strike, the spiritfarers and judges of the Ten-Lords Commission promptly take the afflicted away. It's not something the Alchemy Commission should be meddling in.
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 130.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Mara is scary, but it won't cause any harm if you have it under control. We have the Realm-Keeping Commission and Cloud Knights here in Exalting Sanctum &mdash; more than enough to handle any eventuality.
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 131.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' However, the Dragon Lady's mara-suppression could lead to mara-struck falling under the Ten-Lords Commission's radar. If we let her carry on, we'll have mara-struck on every street corner &mdash; people will panic!
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 132.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Seeing as we're already dealing with one crisis, we need to be extra vigilant when dealing with the mara-struck. This is not something that can be taken lightly.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I see. Leave it to me.
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 133.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' You're the distinguished guest of General Jing Yuan and Diviner Fu Xuan. As such, you also have the full trust of the Realm-Keeping Commission.
::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 134.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Oh, one more thing... There's a lot of suspicion surrounding the Alchemy Commission these days. If you discover someone from the commission on the hunt for the Dragon Lady, watch your step.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It'll be a piece of cake.
:::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 135.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Great!
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Babysitting? No thanks, I'd rather watch paint dry.
:::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 136.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' There's no other way. The Realm-Keeping Commission will pay you handsomely for your help.
::::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have a feeling this is more complicated than it sounds...
:::::{{A|VO side2 bl1 dahao 137.ogg}} '''Dahao:''' Bah, don't fret. Looking after children is a pain, but as the general's distinguished guest, I know you'll do great.

:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 121.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Ugh... Treating wounds and diseases is one thing, but curing the evils of humanity...? There I was thinking someone helped me escape the Alchemy Commission because they genuinely wanted to help me.
:{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 122.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Hmph, enough. Being angry will stunt my growth... Let's put this behind us.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} You've heard of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 123.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' I don't know much. If it weren't for those scrolls in the Alchemy Commission's Elixir Research Terrace, I doubt anyone in the Xianzhou would've heard of them.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 124.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' A long time ago, even by the standards of long-life species, the Xianzhou eliminated an organization that worshiped the "Plagues Author."
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 125.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Why were they eliminated? Because they held an incredibly dangerous notion.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 126.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Xianzhou people wanted to be released from the threat of mara and return to the stability of life and death. Yet the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus believed that being stricken with mara was a blessing &mdash; a natural evolutionary step in casting off the mortal coil.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 127.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Sounds great, right? Well, only if you think becoming a monster devoid of all humanity is a good thing. That's why the Cloud Knights and Ten-Lords Commission cooperated to eliminate the organization.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 128.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' But just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't there. It's like eradicating a sickness &mdash; easier to do when the symptoms are visible. In hindsight, not only did the Disciples endure, they expanded the organization in secret.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Just what does it mean to be mara-struck?
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 129.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' The people of the Xianzhou have asked themselves that question thousands of times.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 130.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Countless doctors and sages have dedicated their lives to researching a cure for the curse. Tragically, besides a few theories, no one has come to a definite conclusion.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 131.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' In truth, nobody in this world can fully comprehend the curse of the Plagues Author.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} And the theories...?
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 132.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Some doctors believe that because the people of the Xianzhou have immortal bodies, their memories accumulate until no more can be stored in the brain.
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 133.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Only the most vivid and extreme memories persist... but such memories are usually ones of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions.

:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 banxia 131.ogg}} '''Banxia:''' It's something I never expected to experience in my lifetime &mdash; falling in love with a short-life species... such a bittersweet feeling.
:::{{A|VO side2 bl1 banxia 132.ogg}} '''Banxia:''' That's when I thought of Lady Bailu &mdash; the Dragon Lady that can heal mortals through tears alone. But it would take 30 years for her to treat all those in need.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} You've heard of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus...
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 123.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' I don't know much. If it weren't for those scrolls in the Alchemy Commission's Elixir Research Terrace, I doubt anyone in the Xianzhou would've heard of them.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 124.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' A long time ago, even by the standards of long-life species, the Xianzhou eliminated an organization that worshiped the "Plagues Author."
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 125.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Why were they eliminated? Because they held an incredibly dangerous notion.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 126.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Xianzhou people wanted to be released from the threat of mara and return to the stability of life and death. Yet the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus believed that being stricken with mara was a blessing &mdash; a natural evolutionary step in casting off the mortal coil.
::{{A|VO side2 bl1 bailu 127.ogg}} '''Bailu:''' Sounds great, right? Well, only if you think becoming a monster devoid of all humanity is a good thing. That's why the Cloud Knights and Ten-Lords Commission cooperated to eliminate the organization.
