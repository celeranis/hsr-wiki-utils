:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 123 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side3 yz argenti 123 f.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' My deepest apologies, Mr. Yang, my concentration has been solely centered on my conversation with (Trailblazer). Now, it is only fitting to disclose the main reason for my presence here: To work jointly in resolving the crisis before us.
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 124.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' I was piloting the "One and Only" through the galaxy when I discovered Velite, an IPC worker who accidentally fell into a huge cave, from which I saved him.
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 125.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Upon saving Velite, I altered my flight course to accompany him to his original location. Consequently, I inadvertently ended up on the Express's navigational trajectory.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who's Velite?
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 126.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' According to him, he is an IPC worker. I believe he's currently resting in the carriage &mdash; he is still in a state of shock.
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 127.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' He swore to follow Idrila, the Goddess, after being impressed by what he saw during our adventure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you rear-end the Express?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Follow Idrila, the Goddess!
::{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 128.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' There was a sudden jolt not long after we had departed &mdash; I was sure we must have collided with some unknown celestial object. When I looked outside, everything was different. That was when we collided with the Express...
::{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 129.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' ...and that is why I boarded the Express with Velite. I am hoping to solve this crisis with you.
:{{A|VO side3 yz welt 108.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Thank you for coming. It'll be a first for the Express to work alongside the Knights of Beauty.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do we do now?
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 130.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Enjoy the present moment.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Huh? And then?
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 131.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' Continue to enjoy the present moment.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's all you could come up with?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Looks like you're really here to make friends...
:{{A|VO side3 yz argenti 132.ogg}} '''Argenti:''' You misunderstand. I must first wholeheartedly enjoy the red night of the universe before I can discover an inharmonious pitch. These two things are correlated. Once I discover the cause, I shall destroy it.
:{{A|VO side3 yz welt 109.ogg}} '''Welt:''' ...Well, try not to take too long. Things could deteriorate at any moment.
:{{A|VO side3 yz welt 110 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side3 yz welt 110 f.ogg}} '''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), could you please go check on Velite? He looks uneasy. He is a guest of ours, after all.

:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 101.ogg}} '''Velite:''' What is it? Here to cheer me up? Save your breath! Your intentions might as well be written on your forehead.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 102.ogg}} '''Velite:''' I'm just a small-time IPC worker &mdash; that Argenti rescued me. I don't know anything... and I can't help you guys.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 103.ogg}} '''Velite:''' *sigh* I want to go home and have dinner... once we're out of this jam...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I heard you became a follower of Aeon of Beauty. Is that true?
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 104.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Did Argenti tell you that?
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 105.ogg}} '''Velite:''' That guy is unbelievable. Before he rescued me, he said something like: "You must pledge to acknowledge Idrila, the Beauty, as the most peerless beauty of all!"
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 106.ogg}} '''Velite:''' I told him I'd marry her if he liked, as long as he got me out of that stinking cave first... And he refused! I couldn't believe it!
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 107.ogg}} '''Velite:''' My life was on the line, so I just repeated after him: Adrila the Beauty, et cetera... You get the picture.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 108.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Then, he corrected me, "It's Idrila, not Adrila."
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 109.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Who came up with such an awkward-sounding name? I'm a pencil pusher, what the heck do I know about the Aeon of Beauty?
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 110.ogg}} '''Velite:''' But, of course, I repeated it again in order to survive.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 111.ogg}} '''Velite:''' "Idrila, the Beauty, is the most peerless beauty of them all!"
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 112.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Just like that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Can't you be more positive?
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 113.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Tsk, do you think I like being negative? My friend, this is what's known as falling prey to the grim reality of life, understand?
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 114.ogg}} '''Velite:''' When I was young, I assumed my life would be like a novel. I wanted to be a pilot, flying through outer space, exploring the universe in a grand spaceship. But then my parents told me I'd have to work for the IPC and make a bunch of money to fulfill my dreams.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you manage to make a bunch of money in the end?
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 115.ogg}} '''Velite:''' What do you think? Do rich people make forced vows in caves?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Does working for the IPC stop you from pursuing your dreams?
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 116.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Enough! This is a painful topic...
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 117.ogg}} '''Velite:''' I gave up my unrealistic dream of becoming a pilot and worked for the IPC instead. I guess I'm living the life of a supporting character now.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 118.ogg}} '''Velite:''' But after running into Argenti, I had an idea... Perhaps I could make some money with him and turn my life around!
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 119.ogg}} '''Velite:''' He's a tall, handsome, and a knight! Packaged and marketed the right way, I'm sure he'll pique a lot of interest!
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 120.ogg}} '''Velite:''' I told him about my idea &mdash; that he could advocate for "the Beauty" while also incorporating currency as a notion of beauty. That would allow him to preach more efficiently. He was very impressed.
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 121.ogg}} '''Velite:''' I'm planning to contact the Marketing Development Department as soon as I'm off the Express &mdash; he'll make a great IPC product spokesperson! And I can be his agent! Now, the question remains &mdash; will this guy shine brighter as an image-focused idol, or should we showcase his formidable talents and mold him into a powerful star?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} An idol.
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 122.ogg}} '''Velite:''' You're right. It'd be a shame to waste such a handsome face. He just screams "idol!"
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A powerful star.
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 123.ogg}} '''Velite:''' You're right. I don't know what his rank among the knights is, but he is quite powerful.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are you talking about?
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 124.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Hmph, it's called facing reality, embracing it, and then conquering it!
:{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 125.ogg}} '''Velite:''' So, when can I get off the Express? I need you guys to solve this traffic jam problem ASAP!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's enough of your weird ideas. Come help us.
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 126.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Were you even listening to me?
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 127.ogg}} '''Velite:''' *sigh* Alright, I have nowhere else to be. Let's go.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Come help us... Pretty please?
::{{A|VO side3 yz vylet 128.ogg}} '''Velite:''' Don't use that tone! You're trying to guilt-trip me, aren't you?
