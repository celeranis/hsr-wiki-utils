:{{Black Screen|After some time...}}
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 160.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I bet Argenti would think these fireworks were really... beautiful.
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 161.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We didn't know him very long, but he was a pretty nice guy.
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 162.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 163.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Tsk, I hope he made it...
:{{A|VO side3 yz pompom 138.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' The Express managed to escape the crisis, but Pom-Pom still feels a little sad... Pom-Pom wonders what happened to Argenti.
:<!--0.4-second delay-->
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 164.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *sigh* Velite just left the Express too &mdash; he looked really upset. I guess he didn't know what Argenti was thinking, either...
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 118.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The Knights of Beauty are made up of individuals who are used to traveling through the cosmos alone... they are difficult to understand, and the starry sky is their home. Perhaps this firework show is a symbol of his honor.
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 165.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But the fireworks...
:{{A|VO side3 yz pompom 139.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' ...And the starry sky...
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 166.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' ...He didn't see it...
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 119.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' He has his own goals... and struggles. After all, the Aeon of Beauty has likely already fallen.
:<!--0.3-second delay-->
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 167.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? You mean Idrila &mdash; the one he wouldn't stop talking about? But... he said he'd find them... and fulfill his duty to protect them.
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 120.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' The fact that Idrila has fallen is tacitly acknowledged by some Knights of Beauty. Naturally, there are others who don't want to believe it... like the one you met. He probably thinks that Idrila is simply missing &mdash; hiding somewhere beyond the reach of mortals.
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side3 yz himeko 121 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' (Trailblazer), the crisis is over, and our unexpected guest has left, but I think there's still something we should talk about.
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 122.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' ...In your opinion, what is beauty?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A lover's eyes.
::{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 123.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' They must be beautiful eyes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} All fun and no work!
::{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 124.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Sounds like a wonderful life &mdash; I'm sure many have dreams of that.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Obsessively watching cats eat food.
::{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 125.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Haha, you have a wild imagination.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That which exists between the Crew...
::{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 126.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Oh? That's a good answer.
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 127.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Beauty takes many forms, and different people have different answers... I wonder what exactly it is that the Knights of Beauty are pursuing through the cosmos.
:{{A|VO side3 yz himeko 128.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Let's assume that Argenti finds the "missing" Idrila. Will he be able to recognize THEM with his human eyes? Or, obsessed with his version of "THEM," will he turn a blind eye and not even see THEM for who THEY are?
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 168.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Mm... It did seem like he had a kind of... tunnel vision. And it sounded like he was holding himself to unreachable standards to attain his dreams.
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 169.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I didn't quite wrap my head around him... I guess if we're ever back in Belobog and see a red-headed knight shouting into trashcans &mdash; "Idrila, are you in there!? Idrilaaaa!" ...I won't be surprised.
:{{A|VO side3 yz mar7th 170.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But, so what? I still think he was a nice guy, even if he was a bit weird...
:{{A|VO side3 yz pompom 140.ogg}} '''Pom-Pom:''' *sigh* Where were we supposed to be going again?
