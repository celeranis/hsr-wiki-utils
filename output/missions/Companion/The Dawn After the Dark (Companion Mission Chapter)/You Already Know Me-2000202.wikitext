{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Base Zone|update|After understanding the rumor about Asta's alleged embezzlement, you decide to report everything to Asta.<br />What was surprising is not only Asta's wealth, but also the truth behind the anonymous chat group...}}

===Speak with Richard and inquire about the rumor and the encryption key===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Base Zone|update|The real name of Richard_Knowitall &mdash; the rumor maker in the anonymous group &mdash; is Richard. You couldn't help but laugh when you consider the fact that he used his real name in an anonymous chat group.<br />Richard righteously recounts his deductions to you and insists that he is going to report Asta to Madam Herta.<br />Looking through the "evidence" he presented, you conclude that this is only a farce.}}
