:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You said you were friends.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You can't give in to her!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What level of beauty filter do you want for the photo?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 118.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' *sigh* There are many types of friend... She's the type you can only stay friends with if you never meet her.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you Richard_Knowitall?
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 102.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Oho! Well done &mdash; you found me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you the one who started the rumor about Asta?
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 103.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Rumors? More like a formal complaint!
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 104.ogg}} '''Richard:''' So you're here about the lead researcher's corruption? Anything for a good story, huh?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 105.ogg}} '''Richard:''' I don't get it &mdash; you people live your lives for gossip.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 106.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Wouldn't it be better to apply that drive to your research? Madam Herta would be delighted to see everyone working so hard.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm here to punish you.
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 107.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Haha, who do you think you are? The space station's next lead researcher?
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 108.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Please. Only upstanding and intelligent people like myself are worthy of such a position. You gossipers need to figure out your place in the hierarchy.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hand over Asta's encryption key.
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 109.ogg}} '''Richard:''' What encryption key...
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 110.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Have you been reading too many novels? You think there's some hidden heir on this space station with keys to the family coffers? Less fantasizing, more researching, got it?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 111.ogg}} '''Richard:''' You want the scoop? Fine. I've backed it all up anyway. Here, take it. And let it be known that I, Richard_Knowitall, do not spread rumors.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 112.ogg}} '''Richard:''' This is the receipt. See the title on this purchase order...?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 113.ogg}} '''Richard:''' That's what I call substantive evidence! Hmph...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the source of this document reliable?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 114.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Of course it is! If I had any doubt, I'd have kept it quiet.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 115.ogg}} '''Richard:''' ...I picked it up a few days ago when I was collecting a package. I saw a few receipts requiring the lead researcher's signature.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 116.ogg}} '''Richard:''' The Security Department's head honcho, Arlan &mdash; he left pretty quickly when he saw them. We all know he's on her side anyway.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 117.ogg}} '''Richard:''' So I had a peek, and woah! She's buying equipment for the space station under her own name! I've got her now!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is no evidence at all...
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 118.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Geez, do I really have to break it down for you?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 119.ogg}} '''Richard:''' The space station has its own financial procedures. As long as the purchase is for the space station, no matter how big or small, it has to go through the organizational account using the station's allocated funds.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 120.ogg}} '''Richard:''' The payer here is her private account. She's totally embezzling station funds for herself!
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 121.ogg}} '''Richard:''' I'm so disappointed &mdash; so hurt! She looks like a sweet enough girl, but not only did she fail to repay Madam Herta for promoting her, she even stooped to this.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 122.ogg}} '''Richard:''' I was so angry that I was shaking. I broke out in a cold sweat!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you ever considered that... maybe she paid for it herself?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 123.ogg}} '''Richard:''' That amount of money? Herself!? Who do you think she is, Fleming's daughter?
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 staffX 124.ogg}} '''Richard:''' Anyway, now you know everything, so leave me alone. I still need to write a report about this for Madam Herta.
