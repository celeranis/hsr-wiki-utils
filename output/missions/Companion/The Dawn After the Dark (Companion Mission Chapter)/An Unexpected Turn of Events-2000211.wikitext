::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 209.ogg}} '''Asta:''' But Arlan doesn't have any other bosses &mdash; who else would it be? March, he asked to accompany you so he could learn how to manage his stress, right?
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 122.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh? Arlan wanted to go on assignments just to experience stress!?
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 123.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Phew... Good thing I let him go alone &mdash; my calming influence would've ruined his training.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 124.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hehe, guess I made the right decision after all.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dan Heng was right.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 125.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' What did he say? That I'm good at solving people's problems?
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 210.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Ugh, Arlan, all I want you to understand is how sincerely I'm reflecting on my actions. Please accept my apology!
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 121.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' But, my lady...
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 211.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Stop!
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 212.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Arlan, I understood the level of stress you're dealing with as soon as I saw this photo.

:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 126.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Didn't I take that photo?
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 213.ogg}} '''Asta:''' I'm always giving you tasks and assignments, but I never actually see how you take to the battlefield...
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 214.ogg}} '''Asta:''' ...when I saw this photo, when I saw you fighting alone just now...
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 215.ogg}} '''Asta:''' I'm just sorry that I gave you the stress of all my private affairs on top of an already stressful job.
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 216.ogg}} '''Asta:''' Please forgive me, Arlan.
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 122.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' ...
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 123.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' My Lady, I... I'm very touched, but...
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 124.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' I started this trial because of Madam Herta.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 127.ogg}} '''March 7th and Asta:''' What!?
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 125.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Whenever she's back on the space station, Madam Herta assigns me things outside the Security Department remit.
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 126.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Even if I dared to refuse, I wouldn't know how. She's just... too overbearing.
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 127.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Whether it's helping her test some new specimen, or looking for ancient documents I've never even heard of...
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 128.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' ...Assignments like those were okay before the invasion, but now I need to focus on clearing out any last traces of the Legion.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 128.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Aha! So, you're trying to learn how to reject Herta, and then put it into practice!
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 129.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Yes. I found an anonymous handwritten journal while I was cleaning up &mdash; it mentioned 36 different strategies for relieving pressure. That's where I read about the trials.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of the heart, of the mirror, of the self...?
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 130.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' Yes. There were detailed notes, so... I wanted to give them a try.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those trials really made Asta worry.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't just read any anonymous journal!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you really think it would help...?
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 131.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' I'm sorry, my lady... I didn't want to bother anyone, so I didn't mention it.
::{{A|VO Side0 al asta 218.ogg}} '''Asta:''' So... you don't feel pressured around me?
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 132.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' I've never felt pressured around you, my lady.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 129.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Alright, alright &mdash; it's all a misunderstanding. You two should reflect on your actions!
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 130 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 130 f.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Right, (Trailblazer)?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You need to talk to each other more.
:::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 131.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yeah! See, the two of us would never have misunderstandings like this.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You both need to start saying what you're thinking.
:::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 132.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Yup! I always say what I'm thinking.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You both need to use your brains more.
:::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 133.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' That's righ&mdash; Hey! This is supposed to be a happy moment!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Anyways, Dan Heng was right...
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 134.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You keep saying that &mdash; what did Dan Heng even say...
::{{A|VO Side0 al arlan 133.ogg}} '''Arlan:''' ...Thank you for helping Lady Asta... and for coming to find me.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 135.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' You're welcome! Although if you really wanna thank me... let me play holodisc with Peppy &mdash; pleaaaase~?

;(Talk to March 7th)

:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 101.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' *gasp* What a cute doggy! ...Oh, you're here too.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is Arlan not with you?
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 102.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' He was, but not anymore.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 103.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' He wanted to go investigating on his own, so I let him~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Nice of you to acknowledge the canine before me.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 104.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hey! He's a new face, and you're not.
::{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 105.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Huh, this little guy looks familiar... Ah! Are you Arlan's Peppy? Awwww I'm sowwie, your master isn't here. He's gone off to investigate~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did he mention anything about a trial?
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 106.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' He kept harping on about Dan Heng being a "true warrior" or something...
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 107.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Oh, he did say that completing an assignment with me would help him "complete the final trial."
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 108.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Hehe, it felt like he learned a lot from me. Then again, everyone has a lot to learn from me, hee-hee~
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you split up?
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 109.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' We were investigating suspicious crystals together, but he said it was all pointless if he couldn't "transform" himself...
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 110.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I could tell he was giving himself a lot of pressure, so I gave him a suggestion~
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 111.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' I told him actions speak louder than words when you wanna prove yourself... I was just thinking out loud really, I had no idea what kind of trial he was doing.
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 112.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' But when he heard that, he said "Mr. Dan Heng was right."
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 113.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' And then he just left. I took a photo of him &mdash; he was doing one of those tough guy walks!
:{{A|VO Side0 al mar7th 114.ogg}} '''March 7th:''' Come to think of it, maybe I shouldn't have left him alone. Take me with you if you're going after him!
