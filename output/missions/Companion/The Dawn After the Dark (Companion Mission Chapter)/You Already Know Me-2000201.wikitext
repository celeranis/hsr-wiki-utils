===Ask Himeko about the rumors in the space station{{subst:void|<!--200020101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Parlor Car|update|A mysterious person gets you into the anonymous group chat for the space station, where a rumor about Asta misappropriating public funds is gaining popularity.<br />Righteous as you are, you want to step up and challenge this rumor, but where will you start your investigation?<br />As you puzzle over this, a sudden thought comes to you &mdash; why not ask the omnipotent Himeko?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Himeko)
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 102.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It must be difficult for Asta. Being the lead researcher isn't easy.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 103.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' As soon as the Legion exits stage right, in comes the gossip... How does that saying go again? "Greet enemies outside with a smile, greet enemies inside with a sword..."
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 104.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Such is the Herta company culture...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You seem pretty cheerful about it.
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 105.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' What do you mean? This is such an inter&mdash; Uh... inconvenient situation.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Company culture stems from the company owner...
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 106.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Haha, Herta doesn't really have anything to do with it. I'm afraid wherever you find people, you find gossip of some variety.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 107 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 107 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' (Trailblazer), are you thinking of getting involved?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, just eating popcorn on the sidelines...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I really want to help Asta.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 108.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Well, while these rumors have nothing to do with us, they do concern the reputation of young Asta. And turning a blind eye is not the way of the Nameless.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 109.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' Solving a matter like this won't be difficult. Predictably, the crowd cares more about the drama than the facts. Stopping the rumors from brewing is more important right now than laying out the truth... and it's better to unearth the source of the rumors directly than to painstakingly try to refute them one by one.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} As always, your guidance is wise.
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 110 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 110 f.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' You're a smooth talker, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So we get rid of the troublemaker, right?
::{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 111.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' No, no... that's not what I meant...
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 112.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I have a friend &mdash; they say there isn't a single piece of station gossip she doesn't know about.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Talking about yourself?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I didn't realize you liked gossip too, Himeko...
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 113.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' First of all, it's not me. Secondly, I don't make friends JUST for the sake of gossip.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 114.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' It's just that my friend is pretty amazing, and I think you might be able to extract some information from her. Let's see... Right now she's probably slacking off somewhere outside the department.
:{{A|VO Side0 ast1 himeko 115.ogg}} '''Himeko:''' I don't know her real name, but she calls herself {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|Gossipmonger}}....

:::'''Welt:''' The damage to the exterior of the Express during the warp jump...
:::'''Welt:''' Mmm, (Trailblazer). You're back. Anything special you've got to share with me?
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Chat about the city)
::::'''Welt:''' The last bastion against the Eternal Freeze, and the miracle of a city that manages to maintain a constant temperature...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Chat about the Geomarrow mine)
::::'''Welt:''' Weird crystals grown out of the Fragmentum, which can corrode and hurt humans...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Chat about Svarog)
::::'''Welt:''' An ancient but intelligent robot...
:::'''Welt:''' There's still so much to explore in this snow-covered extinct world. If you didn't see it for yourself, it'd be really hard to imagine.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mr. Yang seems to crave adventure...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is it boring aboard the Express?
:::'''Welt:''' I don't care if you laugh, but I once lived eight boring years like this. Just a straight line from home to work and back again, working from nine to five. I once thought I could live that way forever.
:::'''Welt:''' But, just like you, I left my home for my own reasons and boarded this Express. As the journey unfolds, that blood-boiling feeling from the heat of the battle gradually returned to me...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of world did Mr. Yang come from?
::::'''Welt:''' It's a beautiful planet, with distinct seasons, splendid mountains and oceans, and a habitable atmosphere.
::::'''Welt:''' But it's also a planet haunted by a power known as the Honkai, constantly playing out cycles of destruction and prosperity...
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What was your profession, Mr. Yang?
::::'''Welt:''' An animation artist.
::::'''Welt:''' Your expression... What? Is it really that surprising?
::::'''Welt:''' Having a career you love in a peaceful world is the dream of many people.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why did you leave your home?
::::'''Welt:''' For no particular reason...
::::'''Welt:''' Just to fight alien invaders from beyond the sky. An... old friend and I embarked on a journey to end that threat once and for all.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Invaders... The Antimatter Legion?
::::'''Welt:''' The invaders I was dealing with was an alien race known as "the ones above."
::::'''Welt:''' You know, there are many civilizations scattered throughout the stars. Some are no less dangerous than the Antimatter Legion.
::::'''Welt:''' Travel for long enough, and you'll be sure to bump into an alien species or two. That's when you'll understand many things cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations.
::::'''Welt:''' The only way to guarantee complete protection of someone you care about is through combat.
:::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This old friend... I think Himeko mentioned them before.
::::'''Welt:''' Hmm? Himeko did? Looks like she's not that mad, then...
::::'''Welt:''' This old friend had already left the Express. I hope he can find what he is looking for on his journey.
::::'''Pom-Pom:''' Mr. Yang, please go to the star rail stabilization system and complete inspections...
::::'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), the conductor has plans for me. I have to go to work.
::::'''Welt:''' Hope your mission goes smoothly. By the way, thank you for sharing all your adventures with me.
:;(If {{cx}}<!--not during performance 599000203-->)
:::'''Welt:''' I'm so sorry, but Pom-Pom is cracking the whip again.
:::'''Welt:''' If time permits, I hope you can chat with me more about your adventures on that planet.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 101000205-->, {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 101100201-->, and {{cx}}<!--during performance 599000202-->)
::'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), you're back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We narrowly averted disaster, and now we're home.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We almost didn't make it back...
::'''Welt:''' It's a shame I couldn't go with you...
::'''Welt:''' (Trailblazer), you're welcome to come and talk to me any time.
::'''Welt:''' Although I cannot travel with you, I can at least share your adventures.
;(Otherwise, if {{cx}}<!--SubMission not Finish: 100050304--> and {{cx}}<!--SubMission Finish: 100050201-->)
::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 117.ogg}} '''Welt:''' This is your first time experiencing the warp jump, so a little discomfort is unavoidable.
::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 118.ogg}} '''Welt:''' If you're really anxious about it, I can stay here and have a chat with you.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} About our companions...
:::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 119.ogg}} '''Welt:''' About everyone on the Express? Who would you like to know about?
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Himeko...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 120.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Haha, she's the owner of the Express. We joke around calling Pom-Pom the conductor, but everyone knows Himeko is the boss.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 121.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It all started with her encounter with the Astral Express, and they haven't been apart since then.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 122.ogg}} '''Welt:''' She's... extremely passionate, like a burning sun. However, she remains mysterious most of the time. Once in a while, you feel that she's burning herself out trying to accomplish her dream.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 123.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Only someone like her is worthy of the Astral Express. I think Himeko's vision of her whole life revolves around... a very important dream.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Pom-Pom...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 124.ogg}} '''Welt:''' To be honest, I don't know when Pom-Pom appeared... I think it was before I came to the Express? No wait, maybe it was after...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 125.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Pom-Pom is like the spirit of the Astral Express. Whenever anyone on the Express needs help, they will appear immediately. It would be ill-advised to underestimate them.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 126.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Pom-Pom is terrifying when they get angry... Yes, terrifying...
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Dan Heng...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 127.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Dan Heng is a lonely child. He may appear distant and cold, but his heart is kind. Perhaps, he's the way he is today because he spent so much time on the run. Sometimes, he reminds me of myself when I was young...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 128.ogg}} '''Welt:''' We don't know what he's running from. He once told me that he didn't know either. All he knew was that something was chasing him and that he had to run away &mdash; first from the Xianzhou, then the IPC.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 129.ogg}} '''Welt:''' So he boarded the ship of a troupe called the "Mourning Actors" and escaped the IPC. After a while he made his way to the Express, and he's stayed here longer than anywhere else.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 130.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Don't worry, no matter who or what wants to hurt Dan Heng, we won't let them. Those who dare attack members of the Astral Express should be prepared to suffer the wrath of me and Himeko.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} About March 7th...
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 131.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Did Himeko tell you about March 7th? She was trapped in ice, floating through space. We happened upon her and rescued her.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 132.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It was a unique type of ice known as Six-Phased Ice &mdash; a substance that adheres to Imaginary Law, meaning that external forces cannot change its form.
::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 133.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Whoever sealed her inside the Six-Phased Ice... No matter who it is... did so either to protect or banish her. I believe she had been floating through space for some time.
:::;(Return to previous option selection)
:::{{DIcon|Return}} I have another question...
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About Stellarons...
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 134.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's impossible to trace the origin of this phenomenon. When it's observed by humans &mdash; or I should say once it begins to affect the physical world &mdash; it's already too late to reverse.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 135.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It's like a sudden storm that appears on a calm ocean. This phenomenon causes the smooth journey through the expanse to be filled with dangers.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 136.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The mechanism whereby this mutation and corrosion spreads is the Stellarons.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 137.ogg}} '''Welt:''' It promulgated rapidly like cancer cells, so the Interastral Peace Corporation named it the Cancer of All Worlds.
::::;(Return to previous option selection)
::::{{DIcon|Talk}} About the Antimatter Legion...
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 138.ogg}} '''Welt:''' They are an army ruled by the Aeon of Destruction, Nanook.

:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 140.ogg}} '''Welt:''' Their actions cannot be explained by reason, because their only motivation and purpose is to destroy.

:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 141.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The Fragmentums are a phenomenon of corrosion.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 142.ogg}} '''Welt:''' The mainstream school of thought is that Stellarons catalyzed the appearance of Fragmentums.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 143.ogg}} '''Welt:''' All matter and space that comes into contact with the Fragmentum will be turned into Fragmentum creations.
:::::{{A|VO chapter0 7 welt 144.ogg}} '''Welt:''' However, you don't have to feel too burdened. At the very least, the current state of the Stellaron in your body is very stable and will not cause distortion to the outside.
