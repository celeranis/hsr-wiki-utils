:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 103.ogg}} '''Pela:''' So much snow... Even in the northern mountains, it wasn't like this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did you bring enough warm clothes?
::{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 102.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' The snow is supposed to get heavier later in the day... Have you got enough warm clothes?
::{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 104.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Yep, I brought everything you told me to &mdash; all thanks to your camping guide.
::{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 105.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Speaking of which, according to the guide, the first thing we need to do is find a good place to set up camp, right? Flat, dry, sheltered, facing the sun, high elevation...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We need to find a good place to set up camp first.

::{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 106.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Right! The guide says we should find a flat, dry, sheltered location &mdash; facing the sun at high elevation...
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 104.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' ...You remembered all that? I expected no less from you! But it's gonna be hard finding a place that fits those criteria.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 105.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' Well, we'll just keep moving and see. The place has to be convenient enough for us to observe the aurora, too.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 107.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Hehe, thanks, Lynxy!
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 108.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I'll leave it to you then. I'm gonna follow right behind you.

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 107.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' Nope. The wind blows strongly through here, and there are signs of direwolf activity... It'd be too dangerous to make camp.

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 108.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' But there are cliffs all around. We'll be in trouble if there's a landslide or rockfall. Also, there isn't much of a view...
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 109.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' Ah! I remember a good place that's not too far from here. Follow me!

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 116.ogg}} '''Pela:''' Lynxy, are you sure this is the place?
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 110.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' Yep. This is the path to Kandor Valley. There are low cliffs on both sides, but I cleared all the monsters here a while ago, so it should be safe and sound.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 111.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' Also, the mountain wind during this season usually comes from the north, which is another reason why we couldn't camp on that previous slope. These two hills can block the Snow Plains gales for us.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 117.ogg}} '''Pela:''' I never even noticed! Huh, camping is a complicated science...
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 lynx 112.ogg}} '''Lynx:''' ...Not really, but the environment outside of Belobog is very tough.

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 pela 118.ogg}} '''Pela:''' That's true. I hope that becomes a reality one day.
