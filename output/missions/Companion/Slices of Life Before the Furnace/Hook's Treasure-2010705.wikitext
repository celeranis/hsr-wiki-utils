===Ask Hook what she wants from you{{subst:void|<!--201070500-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|Hook of the Moles wants to see you. As an honorary member of the Moles, it's your duty to answer her call.<br />Although Hook has the smugness of a child, you can't help but want to help her, perhaps out of pity.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Hook)
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 101.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ah, honorary member of The Moles! Listen up!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is it?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 102.ogg}} '''Hook:''' How rude! You should have called me Pitch-Dark... Ugh, never mind...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 103.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Thank you for helping Hook find the detector, but now Hook needs to ask you another favor...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Leave it to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 104.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Haha, I haven't even mentioned what this is about! But that's the spirit. You truly are an honorary member of The Moles!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm all ears.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Allow me to refuse.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 105.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hmph, at least hear me out first before you refuse.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 106.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hook and daddy's birthday is approaching! Every year at this time, we exchange gifts and celebrate our birthday together.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You two share a birthday? What a coincidence!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 107.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Yeah, what's the problem?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 108.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Daddy's job has been more difficult since moving to Boulder Town. He gets home really late every day. I don't want to use his hard-earned money to buy a gift!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hook, you are so considerate.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 109.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hee-hee...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 110.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hey, are you patronizing me!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not ask Natasha for some money?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 111.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...Oh, I've broken a thing or two in the clinic, you see... I'm too embarrassed to ask for help from the old witch...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 112.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Actually, I still have some valuable treasure of my own in Rivet Town. It's a shame I left it there. If I go bring it back and sell it for a decent price, I can buy a gift for daddy without begging anyone for money.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Rivet Town is in Fragmentum...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 113.ogg}} '''Hook:''' I know that Rivet Town is super dangerous right now! That's why I'd like to enlist you as my bodyguard!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 114.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That way, even if the old witch finds out later, I won't be the only one getting a scolding, hehe!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So you're begging me to help?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 115.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Wh&mdash;What nonsense! This is an order from the boss of The Moles. An order!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 116.ogg}} '''Hook:''' And I'm still a kid! You wouldn't let me go inside the Fragmentum by myself, would you?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 117.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Then it's settled, let's meet in Rivet Town! I'll be waiting for you in a safe spot. You're not allowed to not come!

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The bad news.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 124.ogg}} '''Hook:''' I told the rest of The Moles about the plan, and Julian asked me to get some treasure for him. If we don't help him, he'll tell the old witch where we've gone!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 131.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Julian's parents used to own a business in this area. When we were all forced to leave the town, there were lots of things they didn't have time to take with them.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 132.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...It shouldn't be too hard to locate his treasure! Let's start by looking over there!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 133.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ah, we found Julian's treasure! No, not the key &mdash; these glass marbles. Look at all the different colors! I bet it wasn't easy collecting all these.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What are these marbles used for?

::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 135.ogg}} '''Hook:''' By the way, what does this key open? Maybe Julian knows...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought the key was the treasure...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 136.ogg}} '''Hook:''' No, these marbles are what he's after.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 137.ogg}} '''Hook:''' But I'm also curious... What does this key open? Let's ask Julian when we get back.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 138.ogg}} '''Hook:''' What's that look on your face? Oh, I get it. You don't think this jar of glass marbles is worth anything, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It doesn't look like anything special.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's not what I was thinking...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 139.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hmph, don't even try to pretend otherwise! The look on your face sold you out!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 140.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Let me tell you something, this jar of marbles means a lot to The Moles.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 141.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Julian used it to help The Moles overcome a super-huge crisis, for which he was promoted to second-in-command!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He defeated Fragmentum monsters with marbles?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 142.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Of course it wasn't that. But his accomplishments are nothing to be scoffed at!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The crisis you're referring to...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 143.ogg}} '''Hook:''' It was a super-huge crisis that jeopardized The Moles' honor!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like kids playing make-believe!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 144.ogg}} '''Hook:''' You're being a rude adult again... Believe me, I'm not exaggerating when I say that crisis was super huge!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 145.ogg}} '''Hook:''' In the past, the kids in town were archrivals to us at the orphanage! Those kids used to bully us, relying on the pocket money that their parents gave 'em.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 146.ogg}} '''Hook:''' One time, they sent us a formal declaration of war &mdash; challenging The Moles to a marbles competition!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 147.ogg}} '''Hook:''' We were all well aware that we didn't stand a chance! We at the orphanage only had some old glass marbles we scavenged from the side of the road, which were no match for those rich kids' marbles!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 148.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Nonetheless, Julian bravely accepted the challenge... and triumphantly returned with a pile of colorful glass marbles he won! It was incredible!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wow, what a little hero.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 149.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Yep. So now you know why he wanted us to find this treasure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's no wonder he values these marbles so much.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 149.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Yep. So now you know why he wanted us to find this treasure.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's it?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 151.ogg}} '''Hook:''' After that epic story, that's all you have to say? Ugh... I would've been better off telling a stone-grilled olm instead.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 152.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Alright, enough chit-chat! Next we need to find my treasure.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Perhaps these are stacked here to keep the monsters away.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Who knows?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 156.ogg}} '''Hook:''' I used to keep it in the mining team's junk pile. Behind the corner, there were heaps of Geomarrow and boxes. Hopefully, it hasn't been taken.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is that all the info you have?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 157.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That's all I can recall. But don't worry, I'll look with you! Heh, I may even find it before you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Got it, I'll start looking.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 158.ogg}} '''Hook:''' I'll look with you. We'll definitely find it if we work together.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's all you came up with after calming down!?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 172.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...Uhh, what? Hehehe, did you think I was serious? I wasn't actually planning on selling these marbles &mdash; besides, they aren't even worth much.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But these marbles belong to Julian...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 173.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...*sigh* I wasn't actually planning on selling these marbles... But Julian gets his treasure and I get nothing... What a lousy bargain!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They're worth half a shield at most.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 174.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That's it!? Ugh, I guess I'll have to abandon my evil plan.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why not find someone to fix it?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 175.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That might work... but it'll be pretty expensive to fix, right?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about we ask the guy who gave you the gift for help?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is the drill rig really that valuable?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 178.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Not as much as Diggertron, but that guy who gave it to me was pretty skillful. He could always make fancy things.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about we ask him to help you fix it?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 176.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Not possible. Daddy said that guy went missing one day, and he never saw him again. Maybe he went to someplace far away...

::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 201.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Okay forget it, let's not open it!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 202.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Here it is &mdash; my teddy bear! The old witch gave it to me as a gift!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is your treasure?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 203.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Yes, he's called Junjun!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was expecting something impressive...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 204.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hey! Don't underestimate Junjun!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 205.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Whoa, Junjun... How did you get covered in dirt? And why do you have so many loose threads? If we don't get you cleaned up, no one will buy you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How much... can you get for him?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 206.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Well, the old witch said that Junjun isn't just any old teddy bear! He'll be worth a lot of money once he's cleaned up!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 207.ogg}} '''Hook:''' *sigh* There's no other way... I haven't learned to sew yet &mdash; I'll have to ask the old witch for help.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do adults really like teddy bears?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 208.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Of course! The old witch said Junjun isn't just any old teddy bear!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 209.ogg}} '''Hook:''' *sigh* I haven't learned to sew yet &mdash; I'll have to ask the old witch for help.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 210.ogg}} '''Hook:''' If she finds out I went somewhere I shouldn't have gone... *whimper* Hook will get lectured all over again...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 211.ogg}} '''Hook:''' But so what if the old witch yells at me, Hook still has to prepare the gift for daddy!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're starting to impress me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't drag me into this when Natasha gets furious.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 212.ogg}} '''Hook:''' We've found the treasure. Let's split! The monsters here give Hook goosebumps &mdash; too scary!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 213.ogg}} '''Hook:''' I'm warning you &mdash; don't you dare tell the old witch about Hook's plan to sell the treasure!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 216.ogg}} '''Hook:''' N&mdash;Natasha! Junjun's in bad shape. Can you help me fix him...?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 102.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I remember giving you Junjun. I haven't seen this fella in years. Where did you find him?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 217.ogg}} '''Hook:''' The... the wind brought him back to me...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Be honest with me, Hook.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 218 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 218 f.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...(Trailblazer) helped me find him in the Rivet Town orphanage.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 104 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 104 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You had (Trailblazer) take you to the Fragmentum just for this teddy bear? Hook, how many times have I told you...?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 219.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Natasha, please! Please help me fix Junjun. I'll clean the clinic for you for a whole month!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 105.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' *sigh* You say that every time, and then...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 220 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 hk2 hook 220 f.ogg}} '''Hook:''' G&mdash;Great, seeya soon! (Trailblazer), I'll leave Junjun with you!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 106.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...What am I going to do with that girl.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 107.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You shouldn't indulge her, outsider. Uh-uh, I know it's difficult to tell Hook "no," but sometimes it just has to be done.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 108.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Junjun... so she gave her bear a name, huh?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Hook seems really fond of this bear.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 109.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I've lost count of all the dolls I've made. To be honest, I wasn't expecting her to like this one so much.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It seems like a regular teddy bear to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 110.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Yeah, I've lost count of all the dolls I've made. Still, Hook clearly likes this one a lot.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 111.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It was an award I used to give the kids in Rivet Town for "good behavior." Can you imagine what an orphanage is like with so many difficult children? I had to come up with a solution to get them to behave.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 112.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hook pretended to be well-behaved for a month in order to get Junjun. She ate on time, slept on time &mdash; even stopped fighting with the other kids...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That must have been some difficult pretending...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 113.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Of course, as soon as she got her award, she went straight back to her old self.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe she's actually a well-behaved kid pretending to be naughty...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 114.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I'm afraid you have no idea how much she suffered that month.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 115.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hook has an uncanny ability to rally people to her cause &mdash; both adults and children. It's a skill alright, and forcing her to be well-behaved puts a lid on it.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 116.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Well, this teddy bear has sure been through the wars. Don't worry, I'll help Hook repair Junjun, but I'll need to find some stuffing...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 117.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' W&mdash;Wait, look at the eyes...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pretty, they look like gemstones.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Round and black.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are they moving?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 118.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Ugh, please don't say that...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 119.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' They must be... erebus? Strange, I didn't notice when I sewed them on...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are they worth a lot?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 120.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I'm no appraiser, but these two gems look to be high quality.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What a surprise...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 121.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' There's no shortage of surprises in life.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Were you distracted or something?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 122.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I think I must have been &mdash; it's not every day you sew precious gems into a teddy bear. Honestly...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 123.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Well, our war torn bear here just became a priceless doll. Not bad, Junjun.

;(Talk to Natasha)
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 124.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Let's talk later. Go and find Hook, she can't have gone too far...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 125.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' *sigh* That girl... I'd barely gotten two sentences out.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk2 natasha 101.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hook? What are you...
