:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotF 116.ogg}} '''Little Robot:''' ███You██Pascal█very██ █like████Clara██!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 212.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hehe, Good boy. Pascal.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 110.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Based on the information gathered, it is recommended that Pascal's data be formatted and integrated into the base network so that he doesn't threaten the property or safety of the camp's residents.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 213.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I know this is the most sensible option, but Pascal...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How are the repairs going?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 111.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Welcome, outsider. Thanks to Clara's hard work, the repairs were completed successfully.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 214.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes, the little fella is alive and well again. It's just that... some parts aren't completely back to normal yet.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Pascal? Is that his name?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 215.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes! Mr. Svarog and I spent a long time coming up with a suitable name...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about Pascal isn't normal, exactly?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 216.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Well... How should I put it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think you should give up...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 217.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Absolutely not! I'm not going to give up...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotF 117.ogg}} '''Pascal:''' ███You██Pascal█good███I██am called██name██!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 218 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 218 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh look, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}! Pascal is greeting you. It's just... his speech is still a little confusing.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 112.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' The examination conducted earlier revealed that the information stored in this robot's core module is incompatible with the new hardware.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 113.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Furthermore, many defective networks were detected in the core module. A significant amount of muddled information with unknown content was discovered during a deep scan.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 219.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Simply put, Pascal's brain is filled with junk information of unknown origin. This junk, along with hardware that's incompatible with his core, caused him to lose his ability to communicate.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 220.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Fortunately, apart from the language module, Pascal is still functioning properly...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 114.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' However, the robot still has a 44.7% chance of malfunctioning. It's recommended that Pascal's data be formatted and integrated into the base network.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 221.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog, I understand, but I think Pascal is different. He possesses a quality that other small robots don't have...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 222.ogg}} '''Clara:''' In some ways, I believe he is similar to Mr. Svarog. I can't overlook this unique quality...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 223 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 223 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog, could you give me a little more time? I want to investigate this further. If we don't find anything, you can integrate Pascal into the network.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 115.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Understood, Clara. I respect your wish. In the meantime, I'll make sure that this robot doesn't endanger other people or property.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So... What should we do now?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 224.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I'd like to recap what I discussed with Mr. Svarog earlier.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We should just format the robot and call it a day...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 robotF 118.ogg}} '''Pascal:''' █Tempering██no██don't██return█back██hurt█!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 225 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 225 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I know this is asking a lot...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 226 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 226 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But... it's very important to me! Please... help me one more time.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Argh, if I have to...
:::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 227 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 227 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh, th&mdash;thanks then... I'm so sorry to trouble you again, (Trailblazer)!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I was just kidding. Let's go!
:::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 228.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Phew... As long as you're not really annoyed with me.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 229.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Let's begin by doing exactly what we did before. Find a new shell, put Pascal's core in it, and see if the hardware is compatible.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 116.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' According to the analysis, Pascal's original hardware was a Direwolf or Grizzly model. If we can put its core into the appropriate shell, there's an 87.3% chance that its language module will return to normal.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 230.ogg}} '''Clara:''' There are all kinds of abandoned robots in the machine graveyard. Let's go take a look.
;(Upon reaching the destination)

;(Upon reaching the destination)
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 231.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It's the same old place. Everywhere you look, there are robots that have lost the ability to function...

===Head to the machine graveyard with Clara to look for a suitable shell{{subst:void|<!--201090604-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Clara seemed to have given the little robot a nice name. It is now called Pascal. This name makes you feel a bit different towards it... but it could also just be an illusion. Forget about it &mdash; You currently face a more important matter.<br />Pascal doesn't seem to be able to talk fluently.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're taking its core too?

::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 246.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Every day, I try to figure out how to repair some of them and return the robots to normal. Except... there are a lot more than Mr. Svarog and I can handle on our own.

::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're a good kid, Clara.
:::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 248 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 248 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Thank you, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}. It makes me happy to hear that.

;(Talk to Svarog)
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 354.ogg}} '''Clara:''' So that's what happened, Mr. Svarog. But there's one thing I don't understand... Why is Pascal being treated as a Fragmentum creature?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 132.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' This robot has been repairing itself using Fragmentum-contaminated components for an extended period of time. Therefore, automatons connected to the base network recognize it as a Fragmentum creature. This is a minor issue that can be resolved by replacing components, do not worry.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 355.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I see... Has Mr. Svarog ever witnessed a similar incident anywhere in the network?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 133.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' No. Network-connected automatons regularly clear out muddled information in their core modules.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 134.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' The likelihood of a robot gaining sentience beyond control is approximately 0.12%. For those that aren't connected to the network, the chance climbs to 3.23%.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 135.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Please keep in mind that these probabilities are only estimates. Over the past 700 years, this has never happened in the Underworld.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So, you don't know what to do either?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 136.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Actually, I do. Contrary to popular belief, improbable events that are easily disregarded frequently result in catastrophes.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 137.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Given that automatons can still develop emotion modules using their own processing power, I have a backup plan in place.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But the robots here appear to be quite intelligent...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 138.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' To make life easier for users, all of Belobog's automatons contain language simulation abilities. They generate appropriate responses by reading preset parameters and mimicking natural human conversations.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 139.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' This, however, is only a simulation, and it does not mean that the automatons have actual emotional intelligence.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 356.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But, Mr. Svarog is different.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 140.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Given that automatons can still develop emotion modules using their own processing power, I have a backup plan in place.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can't believe such an improbable event has actually happened!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 141.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Improbable events that are easily disregarded frequently result in catastrophes.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 137.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Given that automatons can still develop emotion modules using their own processing power, I have a backup plan in place.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 357.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Mr. Svarog always takes all factors into account and handles problems logically... I can't do that myself yet.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 358.ogg}} '''Clara:''' So, what should we do with Pascal?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 143.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' It is recommended that Pascal's data be formatted and integrated into the base network.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 144.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' I will maintain the robot's core module and repair its hardware once it has been integrated into the base network.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 145.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' There is a greater than 97.2% chance that this robot will return to normal after the bad sectors and muddled information are removed. However...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} But what about Pascal's emotional intelligence...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 146.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Once the formatting is complete, the robot's emotional intelligence will vanish.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That sounds like an excellent plan to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 359.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But, once the formatting is complete, Pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 147.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' ...Correct.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know there has to be a catch...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 359.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But, once the formatting is complete, Pascal's emotional intelligence will vanish...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 148.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' ...Correct.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 361.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 362.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Is there no other option...?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 149.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' This option minimizes both internal and external losses. Although Clara's account indicates that the robot is relatively stable, the assessment based on the computations shows that...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 150.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Both the risk of Pascal crashing and the amount of muddled information are increasing. When it approaches 100%...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 363.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I understand.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 364.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But I don't think I'm ready to give up on Pascal just yet.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 365.ogg}} '''Clara:''' We've helped Pascal find compatible hardware. If we can eliminate the muddled information without damaging the sectors linked to his emotional intelligence...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 151.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' You know the chances of that are incredibly low, Clara.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Svarog's calculations are extremely precise.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 366.ogg}} '''Clara:''' No, I can't just give up. There has to be another way!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How do you generally get rid of muddled information?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 152.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' There's only one way to completely remove muddled information &mdash; overwriting.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 153.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' When the muddled information is removed, the base network will create a comprehensive backup and overwrite the data stored in the corresponding sector.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 367.ogg}} '''Clara:''' ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} In all honesty, I don't understand...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 368.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It's okay, Mr. Svarog and I can come up with a solution.
