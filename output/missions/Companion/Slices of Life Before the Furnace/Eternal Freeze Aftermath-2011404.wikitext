You will push deeper into the battlefield while helping the refugees along the way.<br />The deeper you go, the more terrifying the atmosphere of the battlefield becomes &mdash; This is not mere exaggeration, but you actually feel the temperature in the air dropping. The situation is definitely odd. Please proceed with caution.}}
