:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 101 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' (Trailblazer), can I talk to you for a moment? I have a favor to ask. Something... rather personal.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, Nat.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I want to thank you again for recovering the wonder medicine. It meant a lot to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 104.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But disposing of Vache's reagents isn't enough to solve the medical supply shortage. Many of my patients can't be seen promptly, and my stock of medicine is running low.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 105.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Thanks to you, the route to the Overworld through the Furnace Core has reopened. I'd like to use it to return to the surface and see if I can get some help.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Help from whom?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 106.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I knew you'd be interested.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} If you need recovery meds, I've got some in my bag...
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 107 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 107 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hehe, funny as always, (Trailblazer).
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 108.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Remember my adoptive parents I mentioned to you a while ago?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 109.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' After the reopening of the Furnace Core passage, I had an idea. I wrote a letter and asked Sampo to deliver it to my parents' old address.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 110.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I didn't have high hopes, but amazingly, Sampo brought me my mother's reply.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sampo being a gentleman... a rare occurrence...
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 111.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hehe, that's exactly what I thought when I got her letter.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sampo couldn't have forged it, could he?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 112.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' No, I recognize my family's handwriting. We are all doctors after all.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 113.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Mom said they still live at the old house, but they're not working on the front lines anymore. They should still have some connections in the medical school and the hospital, though.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 114.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' If I'm lucky, maybe I can convince them to send extra medical supplies to the Underworld.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 115.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Of course, that's not the only reason for me to go back to the surface... I can't wait to visit my parents again, and I can tell from my mom's letter that they feel the same.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 116 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 116 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' If possible, I would like you to go with me, (Trailblazer).
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I won't say no to you.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 117.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Wonderful, that's such a relief.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 118.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I've sent another letter to my mom telling her to find us near Fountain Plaza. Don't worry, I know my way around the Administrative District.
::----
:{{DIcon|Exit}} I have other things to attend to...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 102.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' It's okay, I understand. You must have some important things on your plate? Don't let them get ahead of you.

:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 119.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...this place doesn't seem to have changed much from what I remember.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 120.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Oh, there you are. Sorry, I got distracted watching the crowds.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 121 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 121 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' (Trailblazer), look at the busy flow of people &mdash; life in the Overworld carries on as usual, as if nothing has happened.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 122.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' We're a little early. I've got an idea...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 123 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 123 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I want to buy my mom a gift. (Trailblazer), you're more of an Overworld local than I am now. Any suggestions?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about flowers from Eversummer Florist?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 124.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Flowers, huh?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 125.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' That's a great idea. I've been underground for so long, I almost forgot what flowers smell like.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 126 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 126 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Flowers it is then, (Trailblazer). Can you lead the way?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How about watching a play at Golden Theater?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 127.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' A play... hmm...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 128.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sounds fun, but there's a chance it won't suit my mom's taste. Let me think...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 129.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oh, yes! I remember there was a florist in the Overworld. How about we head over that way?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 130.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I've been underground for so long, I already forgot what flowers smell like.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} To Neverwinter Workshop...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 131.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Workshop? I'm not too sure about that... Let's see if we have other options.

:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 134.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Eversummer... Was that always the name? Seems I was too young to get the irony back then.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 135.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Sorry, don't mean to sound cynical. Maybe it simply represents the people's hopes up here.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 136.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Now that I think about it, sending flowers is quite the tradition in my family. Mom, dad, Vache, and I... whenever something good happened, we sent each other flowers to celebrate.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 137 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 137 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Do you want to hear a flower story, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Let's hear one, Nat.
::{{DIcon|Talk}} What was your mother's favorite flower...?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 138.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Each year for their anniversary, my dad would send my mom a bouquet of Ball Peonies wrapped in red paper.
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 139.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I heard that Ball Peonies represent "love that knows no end..." It does fit their marriage.
:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What was your father's favorite flower...?
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 140.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' My father is a famous surgeon in Belobog. Because of his fame, people in medical circles paid great attention to his surgeries... He always had a lot of stress to deal with.
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 141.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Each time he finished a tricky operation, my mom and I would buy a single stem of Sunshine, then pin it on the chest pocket of his apron.
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 142.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Sunshines represent "warmth and love of light..." For patients on the verge of death, my dad might have been the only light to penetrate the darkness around them.

:::{{DIcon|Talk}} What was Vache's favorite flower...?
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 143.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Vache... Out of everyone in my family, I think he probably appreciated flowers the least.
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 144.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Still, I remember the day he received his offer from the medical academy. My parents took me to the florist and we bought him the most expensive Marquise stem in the shop.
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 145.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' When we gave him the flower, he failed to hide his smile. You can't imagine how hard it was to get him to smile.

::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 147.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Each year on that day, my parents would give me a bouquet of First Snow. The number of stems represented how many years had passed since I joined the family.
::::{{A|VO Side1 nts2 natasha 148.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I only found out later that First Snow represents "beautiful memories." My parents gave me a beautiful childhood, and I still haven't had the chance to thank them for that...
