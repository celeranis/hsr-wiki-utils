===Meet up with the Landau siblings at the Overworld cable car{{subst:void|<!--201140302-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Administrative District|update|It is about time to meet the Landau siblings. According to Gepard, you are absolutely required for this Underworld trip with the Guards &mdash; and you like hearing this.<br />As it is, why don't you go to the Overworld cable car and meet up with the Landau siblings.}}

;(Talk to Gepard)
----
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 173 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 173 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' (Trailblazer), you're here. Thanks again for agreeing to this.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sorry to keep you waiting.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 174.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Don't be, I only just arrived myself.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You look like you only just got here...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 175.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' You're not wrong, it's only been a few minutes.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What about the rest of the Garrison?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 176.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' They're behind us. If negotiations go well, then Dunn will lead them down into the Underworld.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 177.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' He's a very capable sergeant &mdash; upright, plainspoken &mdash; a model Silvermane Guard.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 178.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...I assume you remember him? You and Serval ambushed &mdash; uh... subdued him in the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone. I think he was out cold for most of the action.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It was an accident...
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 179.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The conflict was a product of the situation, I understand.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 180.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Not to mention... he wasn't in bad shape when we found him. Thank you for holding back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sometimes fights lead to friendship!
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 181.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The conflict was a product of the situation, I understand.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 182.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Not to mention... he wasn't in bad shape when we found him. Thank you for holding back.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} What was that "bygones" thing you said again...?
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 183.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' He wasn't in bad shape when we found him. Thank you for holding back.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 184.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Don't worry, the hard work is already behind us.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 185.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The highest priority for today is establishing good negotiations with the chief of Wildfire &mdash; I'm about to get that process underway. Serval was a little delayed on the way over, but that doesn't affect our schedule. Let's set off.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Alrighty.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 234.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Hold up, I wasn't that late...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Huh, classic Serval.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 235.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Huh? Hold up, I wasn't that late...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 186.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' You weren't that early, either... Still, I don't blame you &mdash; you hadn't seen Mom and Dad in a long time... I'm glad you managed to speak to them.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 236.ogg}} '''Serval:''' We didn't speak all that much... You know how it is, I can only talk to Dad for so long before I start losing it.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 187.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I know how it is alright. Put that to one side for now... We need to get going.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 188 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 188 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Negotiations will be held in the Boulder Town clinic. Serval and I are newcomers, so you'll have to lead the way, (Trailblazer).

===Head to the Boulder Town clinic{{subst:void|<!--201140304-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|This is the first time that the Guards have returned to the Underworld, and the Underworld had changed greatly in the years of blockade. Criticisms for the Guards and the Supreme Guardian also swelled up throughout society there. However, the brother-sister duo of the Landau siblings and you are here to solve this problem.<br />You head to the meeting place, which is Natasha's clinic, with the Landau siblings and the Guards. The Guards from the Overworld and Wildfire from the Underworld will have a formal meeting for the first time there.}}

;(Talk to Oleg)
----
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 101.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Well, well, well! I don't think our little clinic has ever played host to an occasion like this!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 190.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' We meet again, Mr. Oleg.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 102 f.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Hahaha, Oleg will do, son. Oh, (Trailblazer), you probably won't know... Our young Silvermane friend here and I had the pleasure of speaking to each other at a certain guardian's succession ceremony &mdash; we're not complete strangers. But as for this young lady...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 238.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The name's Serval. I'm, uh... an ex-engineer from the Technology Division and... Gepard's sister. Pleasure to meet you, chief!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 103.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Likewise, miss! The more the merrier!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 104 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 104 f.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' And it's good to have you here again, (Trailblazer) &mdash; it bothered me and Natasha that we never arranged a formal welcome for you. Once we're done talking, you must all join us for a meal.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 191.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' We'd be honored. But to your point, Oleg &mdash; let's finish our discussions first.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 105.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Quite right. Let's head inside &mdash; too much commotion out here.
----
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 189.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The Underworld... isn't exactly how I remember it.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 237.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Feels like we're not getting many friendly looks, huh.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Listen to the meeting between the Silvermane Guards and Wildfire{{subst:void|<!--201140305-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Natasha's Clinic|update|The two parties of the meetings have arrived. Though there are very few places to sit in the clinic, you might as well find a spot to audit this "official" meeting.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Talk to Natasha)
----
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 101.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...So she's your sister. The Landau family is full of talented young people I see.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 106.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' You're worried that Underworlders might still hold a grudge against the Silvermane Guards, so you want to show your solidarity with the Trailblazers to build some trust. Seems like a sound strategy to me.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 192.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Rebuilding trust between the two worlds has always been a priority for Lady Bronya.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 193.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' People here must have felt abandoned by the Guards after the passage was sealed off. If we were to simply "take over" the Underworld in the name of the supreme guardian... I can only imagine how people would react.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 107.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Seems like you have a good handle on the situation. I see now why you made captain at such a young age, haha!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 102.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' So... you're also saying the Guards want to work with Wildfire and use our reputation to win back people's support, correct?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 194.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...I wouldn't use those exact words, but that is more or less what we want to achieve.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' If that's the case, I've got a question for you:
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 104.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Since this offer comes from those who left us to our fate for more than a decade... how would you react if Wildfire refused? Hmm? Would you use force?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 239.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Uh... she's not trying to be diplomatic about it, is she?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Natasha won't back down easily...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 240.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Who is she anyway...?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Starting to worry about your brother?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 241.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Hmm... Choose your words wisely, Geppie...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Fight! Fight!
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 242.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Stop stoking the fire!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 195.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 196.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The barrier between the surface and the underground was the product of the former supreme guardian's misjudgment and the policies that resulted from it. The people of Belobog should have stood together, but instead we were made to blame and hate one another...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 197.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Lady Bronya wants Belobog to heal, so the Silvermane Guards need to regain the people's trust. But we won't achieve that by kicking doors open and policing everyone around.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 198.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' As a grassroots organization, Wildfire did an extraordinary job maintaining order for over a decade in the absence of the Guards. I can only imagine how much work you put in to protect the Underworld.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 199.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I can assure you that the Guards are not here to seize power. If it takes time for the people to trust us, so be it. We're willing to take small measures and serve as an auxiliary force to Wildfire to help maintain peace.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 200.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I hope you can see that everything we do, we do to rebuild trust and make Belobog work for all.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He thought of everything! That's a true captain for you.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 243.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I swear he never used to be this emotionally intelligent...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Lil' Geppie has grown up...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 244.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I've never really seen this side of him before... the more you learn.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 105.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...That's an answer I can accept. Oleg, what do you think?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 108.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Haha, I think there's no need for the guessing game to continue. It's obvious we share the same goal.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 109.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' With the help of Bronya, Serval, and Gepard, we're one step closer to rebuilding a united Belobog.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 106.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I agree. Tell Bronya that Wildfire will work with the Silvermane Guards on security matters. However, things aren't simple down here &mdash; please also tell her to draw up plans in case the situation demands&mdash;
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 minerI 101.ogg}} '''Voice outside the Clinic:''' M&mdash;Monsters! Monsters from the Fragmentum!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 minerI 102.ogg}} '''Voice outside the Clinic:''' They're swarming toward the town!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 110.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Not good... Stay here, Natasha &mdash; the patients need you. The soldiers and I will handle this.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 natasha 107.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Understood. We'll be counting on you.

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|The meeting was progressing smoothly until the sudden noises from outside disturbed the harmonious mood in the room.

:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 minerI 107.ogg}} '''Terrified Refugee:''' The Great Mine! The one with the b&mdash;big ore vein...!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 203.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Understood. I'll send my men to set up a perimeter and start the rescue operation right away.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 204.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Mr. Oleg, please entrust the Silvermane Guards with the rescue.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 205.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' The defense of Boulder Town will need Wildfire's expertise. Watch out for ambushes and be ready to receive wounded soldiers.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 111.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Ha, you're a natural-born commander. Understood, leave it to me, son.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 oleg 112.ogg}} '''Oleg:''' Your troops will be unfamiliar with the layout of the mine &mdash; I'll send some of my men to be your guides.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 206.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...Thank you. In the name of the Preservation, I promise we'll do everything we can to save lives.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 207 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 207 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I'll go on ahead and lead the troops to the mine. (Trailblazer), Serval, catch up to us when you can.
