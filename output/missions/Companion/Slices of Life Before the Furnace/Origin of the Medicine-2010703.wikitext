:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 101 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 101 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You came at a good time, (Trailblazer), there is something you can help me with.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 102.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' According to my patient records, there are a few that haven't come for their follow-up visits. It happens from time to time, but never as regularly as this. I'm a bit concerned...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Have you heard of the Complex Illness Mutual Aid Society?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like a charitable organization.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds suspicious...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 104.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Mm, I agree.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 105.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Generally speaking, mutual aid societies like these allow patients to share their experiences and support each other. It's a way of countering all the negative emotional effects of being ill... But there might be more to this society than that.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 106.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I've got a few patients who've started refusing treatment since joining the society... It certainly makes you wonder.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 107.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The most suspicious part is that no matter how much I ask, no one's ever willing to tell me anything about it... and that's where you might be able to help.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Got it, you want me to go undercover.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 108.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...It sounds dangerous, but what I want you to do is actually very simple. Investigate this so-called "Mutual Aid Society" and find out what exactly they're up to.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do I need to be ill before I can make inquiries?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 109.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...That won't be necessary, but it will help if you pretend to be a patient. Help me investigate this so-called "Mutual Aid Society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What should I do?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 110.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hmm... Pretend to be a patient. Help me investigate this so-called "Mutual Aid Society" and find out exactly what they're up to.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 111.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' If I find out they're preventing me from doing my job... or if they're bringing harm to my patients... I won't just sit on the sidelines.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 112 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 112 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Can I entrust you with this task, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No problem, leave it with me.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have I ever refused you?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 113 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 113 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You're as considerate as always, (Trailblazer).
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 114.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' This little clinic has huge numbers of patients to deal with every day... If I didn't have you here to help me out, I wouldn't be able to focus on giving them quality care.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 115 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 115 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Good luck, (Trailblazer). I'll be sure to thank you properly when you're back.

;(Talk to Depressed Patient)
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 101.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' You... I've seen you at the clinic. You run errands for Natasha, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, there goes my cover...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 102.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' ...Your cover? What are you talking about?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uh... Who's Natasha?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 103.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' ...Don't play dumb. I might be sick but my eyes still work.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 104.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' *sigh* Let me guess, Natasha wants you to persuade me to go back for a follow-up visit, right?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 105.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' *sigh* ...What's the use? I'm terminal. Life'll be over before I know it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Was that Natasha's diagnosis?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 106.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Of course not, I read it in a book.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 107.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Every book I read has descriptions that match my symptoms exactly... I can diagnose myself with a dozen incurable diseases before I get halfway through.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 108.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' For people in my situation, a follow-up visit is just a waste of time and money... not to mention medicine.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Are you serious?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Soooo nothing to do with you joining the mutual aid society then?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 109.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Mutual aid what now? What are you talking about?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 110.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' ...What else is there to say. Natasha was seeing me free of charge. She said I could keep a tab running for as long as I liked, then pay it back when I had the opportunity... I guess I'm too proud.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Money's one thing, but life...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 111.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' You think I need you to tell me? Don't try and persuade me, I've already thought this through...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Appearances are more important than life, I feel you.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 112.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' ...Are you making fun of me? Have at it, you won't change my mind.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 113.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' *sigh* ...Dr. Vache never charged me anything either. Natasha's great, but Vache was always my number one...
:{{DIcon}} Who's Dr. Vache?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 114.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Natasha's brother? They both used to practice medicine back in Rivet Town.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 115.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' I heard he was a top student from the Overworld medical academy &mdash; Belobog's main hospital wanted him. I've no idea what convinced him to set up down here... a kind heart, maybe.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Free medical care? I don't believe it...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 116.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' What do you mean? Dr. Vache was a people's doctor &mdash; he handed out free medicine. He even followed up with detailed questions on how we felt.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 117.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' The Underworld is always short on medical resources &mdash; they say that Dr. Vache made all his own medicine himself.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why don't you go to him anymore?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 118.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' You think I don't want to? I heard that he... passed away.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 119.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Uh... I should keep my voice down. Don't go telling anyone else about this next bit...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I won't.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 120.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' I heard that Natasha had something to do with Dr. Vache's death. They say she was jealous that her brother had stolen her patients, so she...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} And you believe that?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 121.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' Agh, it's just something people were saying... I don't think Dr. Natasha could do something like that.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's not impossible...
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 122.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' ...Hey, it's just a rumor. Don't take my word for it.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientA 123.ogg}} '''Depressed Patient:''' *sigh* Forget I said anything. Since Dr. Natasha sent you over specially, I'll do her a favor.

:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 101.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' ...What was that? You'll have to be louder! My ears aren't what they used to be &mdash; everything's muffled.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I wanted to ask why you're not going for your follow-up visit.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 102.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Hah? Follow-up visit? Is that what you're asking about?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 104.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' *sigh* Natasha's a wonderful girl. She always gives me a thorough checkup...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 105.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' But at this age, it's rather a lot to bear. Even if they could cure me, I'm sure I wouldn't be around for long. I don't want to waste anyone's time...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There's no time wasted where health is concerned, right?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 106.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Not for youngsters like yourself. When you get to my time of life, good health is a bit of a luxury I'm afraid.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} You should listen to Dr. Natasha.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 107.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' That girl's always trying to get me to take my medicine on time. *sigh* I know her heart's in the right place...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 108.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' My husband had the same illness as me, but he never touched the medicine. He wanted to make sure I had enough.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 109.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Then one day, he said he needed to take care of some things at the mine. He never came back...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 110.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' He was forever saying he wanted to go before I did. Hehe... Selfish old fool...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 111.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' I miss him. Now that he's gone, who cares how long I stick around?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sure he's up there caring right now.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 112.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' ...Do you think so? Wouldn't he want me to hurry up and join him...?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 113.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Hmph... Kids today don't give up easily.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Dr. Natasha cares.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 114.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' ...You're not wrong, I suppose. That girl certainly spares me no effort, but I always feel like I'm a burden to her...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I care.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 115.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' You don't give up easily, do you? Still... you're full of kind words.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 116.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Okay, you win. It's off for another follow-up visit with Dr. Natasha, I suppose...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 117.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Mm? Did you want to say something else? My ears are terrible...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you heard of the mutual aid society?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 118.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Virtual who?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Mutual aid society!
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientB 119.ogg}} '''Elderly Patient:''' Alright, I heard you! Do you have to shout? ...No, I've never heard of any mutual aid society...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What makes you say that?

:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 109.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' She tries to save everyone, which means she can't save anyone... In the end, it's the patients who suffer, and she just tires herself out.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 110.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Miners like me don't have time for lengthy treatments... If I can't take something and get right back to work, I may as well lie down and wait for death to come knocking...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 111.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Did you know Dr. Vache? His wonder medicine is cheap and the results are immediate. You just need to be willing to... take a little risk.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} "Risk"?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 112.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Dr. Vache's medicine is... different. Lots of people make a full recovery after taking it... but some get worse, and the unlucky ones check out early.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 113.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Even knowing the risk, most people fought tooth and nail to get a hold of the medicine. You know why?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They're willing to gamble with their life...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 114.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Hmph, you're smarter than you look.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've no idea.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 115.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Hmph... you've clearly never been in really dire straits.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 116.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' When life forces you to the edge, you'll throw yourself at any opportunity... even if it means risking it all.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 117.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' For people like us, a slow and tortuous treatment is the same as a death sentence. If it's between that and a quick result, we'll take the latter.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 118.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Ahem, forget it. Why am I telling you all this? Dr. Vache is dead, anyway...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where can I go to get this wonder medicine?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if I told you I agreed with you?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 119.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Hah, what, now you're interested in the wonder medicine?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientC 120.ogg}} '''Suspicious Patient:''' Listen up... the Complex Illness Mutual Aid Society is still selling that medicine... I can tell you where they trade, but there's a rule...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They must have been seriously ill...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 103.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' *sigh* ...Not terribly serious. But they needed to get treatment every now and then, which did impact their livelihood.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And that made her become like this?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 104.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' Yes... Before her family passed away, she was a carefree young woman.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 105.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' Her husband and child caught a mysterious illness. The symptoms weren't grave, but their livelihood was certainly impacted.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 106.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' In order to try and rid themselves of the ailment once and for all, they bought some kind of "wonder medicine..." Who would've thought their condition would deteriorate so rapidly after they began using it.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 107.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' The two began to suffer terribly, such that death became a blessing... It wasn't long before they departed this world, one after the other.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 108.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' From that moment on, oh she became as you see her now. If Dr. Natasha hadn't taken her under her wing... *sigh* Well it doesn't bear thinking about.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It just sounds like poison...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 109.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' And yet what more could've been done? They were warned about the medicine. They were told about the risks... They chose to roll the dice.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} They were unlucky...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 110.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' Just unlucky? As far as I'm concerned, those medicine dealers are making money for murder in broad daylight... Who would sell such a thing to the sick?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 patientH 111.ogg}} '''Kind Old Lady:''' *sigh* Talking about it tires me out. At least my husband and I are able to help her where we can. I just hope that one day she can lead a normal life again...

:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 141.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' By the look on your face... I'm assuming you've come to understand the wonder medicine all too well.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The people selling that stuff are devils.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Those medicine dealers prey on our weaknesses...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 142.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 143.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Be it Vache or the mutual aid society &mdash; forces like that can take full advantage of the... the typical Underworld state of mind.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 144 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 144 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Let me tell you a story, (Trailblazer).
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 145.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' There was once a brilliant Overworld doctor with unmatched pharmaceutical skill.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 146.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The doctor was set on developing a medicine that would steel the human body against the cold. He named his research project "Blizzard Immunity."
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 147.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But his research met with obstruction time and time again, the biggest factor being a lack of test subjects. Tampering with the human immune system carries huge risk, and nobody in the Overworld was willing to submit themselves to such experiments.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 148.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' As such, the doctor got in touch with his sister in the Underworld... claiming that he wanted to support the medical effort below ground.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} And then...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 149.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...Naturally, his sister was overjoyed. After all, as far as medicine was concerned, her brother had always been the standard she'd strived to attain.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 150.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' She brought her brother underground and entrusted him with her clinic and laboratory...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 151.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...I think you know what comes next.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm sorry that I doubted you before...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} It's hard to believe he was your brother...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 152.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Issuing free medicine to the needy was just Vache's way of conducting experiments on his test subjects.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 153.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' On some level, his reagents were able to alleviate the patients' suffering... but nothing more. They would forget their pain for a while, and neglect their regular treatment plans...
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 154.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The result... patients with mild illness would attribute their recovery to the so-called wonder medicine, while patients with serious illness would quickly deteriorate... and sometimes die.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 155 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 155 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I cannot accept that their fate was simply the result of misfortune or risk, (Trailblazer). No true doctor would accept that.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 156.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' That's why I want you to help me recover all the wonder medicine. Are you willing to take on this assignment?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Somebody has to do the right thing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not my preferred course of action, but...
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 157.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...But it's impossible to sit on the sidelines, right?
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 158 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 158 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Thank you, (Trailblazer).
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 159.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' This will be hard for the people that have come to rely on the wonder medicine... but it's up to us to remove this false hope.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 160.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' You mustn't hesitate &mdash; recover every last reagent that Vache left behind. I'll take responsibility for the consequences &mdash; don't worry about that.
:{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 161 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 161 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Go, (Trailblazer). I'll be waiting for the good news.

::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 184.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I actually grew up in the orphanage. It wasn't until I was adopted by an Overworld family that life changed for me.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 185.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' My adoptive mother always saw me as her own flesh and blood, and Vache loved me like a sister... that is, while we were still young.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 186.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' My adoptive parents belonged to a prominent medical family &mdash; as kids, we were exposed to all kinds of medical texts. When we were older, both of us got straight into Belobog's medical school. We were on a path into the medical profession.

:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did he...really pass away?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 191.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' *sigh* That's a long story... Ever since he was little, Vache had always wanted to develop a medicine called "Blizzard Immunity."
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 192.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' He saw the human body's vulnerability to cold as a disease, and wanted to cure it so that humanity could survive the Eternal Freeze. If he succeeded, people would be able to leave Belobog and rebuild their homes in the Snow Plains.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you share his vision?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 193.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' To be honest, I never understood how he'd achieve that "Blizzard Immunity." But I do admire that vision and perseverance... I always chose to believe him, ever since I was a kid.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} (Brief silence)
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 194.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I do admire his vision and perseverance, even though "Blizzard Immunity" always seemed unachievable to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 195.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I knew his research in the Overworld wasn't going well. I used to write to him and ask him to come down and stay with the kids in the orphanage for a while. I thought it might help take his mind off his research.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 196.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But I was too young to know what long-term frustration could do to a person. It changed him in a terrible way...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Changed him...?
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 197.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' During his stay in the Underworld, he met patients affected by Fragmentum corrosion with mild symptoms. Compared with non-patients, their bodies reacted differently to hot and cold. And that fascinated Vache.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 198.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' He began to simulate mild Fragmentum corrosion, thinking that it could lead to breakthroughs in developing Blizzard Immunity.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 199.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Those reagents of his aren't cure-alls for critical illness &mdash; that doesn't exist. Vache made the reagents to mitigate the suffering of his patients in the short term &mdash; a convenient way for him to observe changes in his test subjects.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 200.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' But behind my back, he had been doling out the reagents to residents who were kept in the dark. When it finally struck me that something was wrong, his terrible research had already turned him into... into a madman.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} He'd lost his last shred of humanity...
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 201.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Indeed... and it all happened under my nose. How ridiculous &mdash; my judgment was clouded by trust in a loved one...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Did nothing seem strange to you all that time?
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 202.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I trusted Vache with all my heart. Funny, isn't it? And pathetic.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 203.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' When his experiments were exposed, I spent a long time with Oleg discussing how to handle the aftermath.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 204.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' This was shortly before the Underworld was sealed off &mdash; there were hardly any Silvermane Guards remaining. We spent ages trying to find a way to handle Vache.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 205.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' In the end, Oleg suggested that we banish him and permanently deny him access to the Underworld.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 206.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Had his victims found out the truth, Vache would've been torn to pieces by furious Underworlders. I was young and weak at the time &mdash; Oleg must have worried about how I'd react to such a scenario, or he wouldn't have suggested banishment.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Banishment isn't a particularly harsh punishment...
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 207.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' *sigh* Looking back, it wasn't. He deserved much worse...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You two did the right thing.
:::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 208.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...I hope so. The day I learned the truth was the day I no longer recognized my brother.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 209.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Oleg and I took Vache to the Overworld. He made his final request to us: To take him outside the city to the Snow Plains he'd always wanted to conquer.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 210.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' His figure gradually disappeared into the snow curtain... I've been telling myself that Vache is dead ever since.
::{{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 211 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 nts1 natasha 211 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Forgive me, (Trailblazer), I'm not good at telling stories. Vache was a terrible brother and a worse doctor... That's all you need to know.
