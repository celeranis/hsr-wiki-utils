{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=History and Culture Museum|update|You receive a message from the Landau siblings. As expected, they contacted you because they want to ask for your help, just like everyone else. Unlike the others, however, these two deliberately set up a mystery for you &mdash; They will only tell you what they need if you head to the Museum Finishing Room as they had requested.<br />Is this even the right attitude when you want to ask people for help? You don't quite know, since you were only born in the Herta Space Station a short while ago &mdash; but you must have gotten used to this random way of getting missions by now.<br />Head to the Belobog History and Culture Museum Finishing Room and listen to their request.}}

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 gepard 108.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' She just came back from a scientific exploration on the Snow Plains, but she seems really out of it... almost like she's worried about something...
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 gepard 109.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' And she won't tell us what happened. We're really worried and want to help, but we don't know where to start.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 serval 107.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The last time I saw her, she was preparing to meet someone on the Snow Plains. She even asked for a stove set from me...

::{{A|VO side1 pl1 gepard 111.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' She's used to doing research alone in the Snow Plains, and we've always believed she can protect herself, but this is different... I'm worried she could run into bad people.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That might be difficult...

:{{A|VO side1 pl1 serval 112.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Oh, right! If you're gonna go find Lynxy, you gotta know what she looks like!
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 serval 113.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Don't worry. She stands out. She's blonde like us and, um... quite short. She's always wearing a white fur hat... If I'm right, she should be waiting for someone at the city exit closest to the Snow Plains.
:{{A|VO side1 pl1 serval 114.ogg}} '''Serval:''' We are putting our dearest baby sister in your hands this time. Let us know immediately if anything happens.
