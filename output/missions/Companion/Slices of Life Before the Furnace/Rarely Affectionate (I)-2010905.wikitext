:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 102 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 102 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh, it's you!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 103.ogg}} '''Clara:''' There have been a few unusual thefts in the dwelling over the past few days.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 104.ogg}} '''Clara:''' The vagrants say that the parts they worked so hard to obtain have completely vanished. They're worried that there's a thief in the camp...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 105.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Despite our investigations, no one has been able to track down the thief. What's even stranger is that the thief appears to be only interested in stealing parts, and doesn't care about other valuable items...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 106.ogg}} '''Clara:''' The vagrants had no choice but to ask Mr. Svarog to look into it, but he still hasn't found anything... I investigated the matter myself, but I came up empty-handed...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't worry. We can go over the clues together.

:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 102.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Oh! Clara, it's you! I thought it was... You scared the living daylights out of me!

::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 105.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Oh, wow. I feel way better knowing that a big shot like you is here to catch the thief... H&mdash;Hold on, I'll explain what happened last night. Just let me gather my thoughts first...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The Wildfire has assigned me to solve the case.

::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 107.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' H&mdash;Hold on... I'll explain what happened last night. Just let me gather my thoughts first...

::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 109.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' It's great that there are more people here to solve this case... H&mdash;Hold on, I'll explain what happened last night. Just let me gather my thoughts first...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 110.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' O&mdash;Okay. So... Last night, I was on patrol when I bumped into the thief stealing the parts! Then... then... I&mdash;I just...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why do you sound so terrified?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 111.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Goodness, I was so scared! It was dreadful!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Relax, explain it slowly.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 112.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Goodness... Okay. I'll explain slowly...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't panic. We're only getting started...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 113.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I... you... I&mdash;I'm sorry... Last night was just so terrifying... I&mdash;I'll continue!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 114.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I was cold and hungry while on patrol last night, so I decided to return to the dwelling and heat up some leftover canned food for a snack.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 115.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' But when I entered the tent... the thief's silhouette scurried across my vision!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 116.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I couldn't see the thief's face because the tent was so dark, but I could tell he wasn't a nice guy...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 117.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' B&mdash;Because when he turned to flee, he swung a knife right across my face! In that moment, I really thought I was going to die...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 118.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I could feel the blade's chill on my cheeks, and smell its rusty scent... The weapon that fella had was definitely a metal one! That's the only thing I'm certain of!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 119.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Also, I saw the outline of him in the dark... That fella's head was absolutely square! Yes, you heard me, square!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 120.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Can you believe that? Someone with a square head! It was truly terrifying...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} A square head? Oh my gosh!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 120.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It sounds bizarre, but it could be a clue. I'll jot it down.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Please, I can't carry on. I'm too terrified...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 121.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I&mdash;I'm also terrified! But I still have to jot down the important clues...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Uh, I guess that could be a clue...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 122 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 122 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh, you're right, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}! I see! I'll jot it down...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 123.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Sir, please take a deep breath... So, the thief was armed with a metal weapon and had a... um, square head... correct?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 121.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Yes, that's correct.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 124 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 124 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hmm... I'm struggling to make sense of these clues. Do you have any thoughts, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not really... Is there anything else you noticed?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 122.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I'm sorry... I was too scared! When a shadow leaps out at you, who could possibly pay attention to such tiny details?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 125.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It seems that's everything... We now know one of the culprit's physical traits and that he is extremely violent. But how can we track him down?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you being so evasive? Are you an accomplice?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 123.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' How can you just accuse me like that!? I was terrified, how could I be an accomplice!? *sob* ...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 126 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 126 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I'm sorry! {{MC|f=She|m=He}} was just joking... Please don't take {{MC|f=her|m=him}} seriously!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We've cracked the case! The culprit has a square head!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 127 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 127 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh! You've figured it out. But how are we going to track down someone with such an unusual appearance?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 124.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Ah, yes, I remember something! While the culprit was hurrying to escape, he knocked something over... He may have left some clues or something.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 128 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 128 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' This is a crucial clue! {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, Let's go investigate the crime scene together!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 125 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 125 f.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I think he ran that way. No one has touched the crime scene, so any traces he left behind should still be there... P&mdash;Please catch the thief for us.

:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 127 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 127 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Oh! You've figured it out. But how are we going to track down someone with such an unusual appearance?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 124.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' Ah, yes, I remember something! While the culprit was hurrying to escape, he knocked something over... He may have left some clues or something.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 128 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 128 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' This is a crucial clue! {{MC|f=Big sister|m=Big brother}}, Let's go investigate the crime scene together!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 125 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 vagrantW 125 f.ogg}} '''Shivering Vagrant:''' I think he ran that way. No one has touched the crime scene, so any traces he left behind should still be there... P&mdash;Please catch the thief for us.
:Some abrupt scratches left on the mountain which seem to be done by a metal weapon. The end of the scratches points to a distant place.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 129 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 129 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Take a look at these marks... These are very suspicious. Could they have been left by the culprit?

:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 132 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 132 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' The tracks stop here... I guess we'll have to look around for other clues.

:I didn't expect our thief to like waste heaps...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 135.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Um, I don't think the culprit actually likes waste heaps. He probably uses them as a hiding spot... Oh, maybe he hid the stolen parts here too!
:Come out and face me now, thief!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 136.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hey! You're being too loud... If the culprit is nearby, he'll just run away!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 137.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Let's split up... Wait, what's that noise?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 138.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It's a... tiny robot? Is it searching for something? But... I don't remember Mr. Svarog issuing an order like this recently...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 139.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It looks like it's carrying the vagrants' missing parts...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 140.ogg}} '''Clara:''' And those tracks and metal scratches we noticed earlier...
:The thief doesn't appear to be a human.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 141 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 141 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hmm, it appears we're thinking the same thing...
:Remotely controlling a robot to steal parts... What an ingenious criminal!
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 142.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hmm... That would be quite strange, yet such a scenario can't be ruled out.
:It does have a square head, but it doesn't look like a criminal...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 143.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Yes... This robot model probably doesn't have any kind of metal weapon.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 144.ogg}} '''Clara:''' This small robot... doesn't appear to be a Belobog creation. It looks like it's been welded together from random scrap metal materials... Huh, it appears to have a small mechanical arm...

:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 167.ogg}} '''Clara:''' While Mr. Svarog is assessing this little fella, let's give it a quick checkup ourselves.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 168.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Huh? This paint job and these custom parts. And the way the parts are attached... It's all quite strange.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 169.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But one thing is for certain... This little fella is not under remote control. He's operating entirely of his own accord...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 170.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Its design is, well, unique. I've never seen a robot with a design like this before.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 171.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It really seems like something that was thrown together rather quickly. Its creator most likely didn't consider whether the system would function properly or not...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 172.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Is it a failed robot pet creation that has been abandoned...?
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 173.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But if it's a pet... then why would it gather parts itself?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What is a "robot pet"?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I've heard the term "robot pet" before.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} This place has a somewhat lax definition of pets...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 174.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I've heard that some vagrants in the dwelling keep the little robots they find as pets.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 175.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Some vagrants also make modifications to their pets, which they call... pet upgrades.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 176.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Pets like that are pretty rare, but some of the folks who have them have formed a small community to share ideas. Some are interested in nurturing robots. Others... force them into battle.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 177.ogg}} '''Clara:''' If my memory serves me right, the parts this little fella stole were originally designed for that kind of pet upgrade.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Battle each other!? That's awful!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 178.ogg}} '''Clara:''' The vagrants... or, to be more accurate, the majority of people in the Underworld regard robots as nothing more than tools.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 179.ogg}} '''Clara:''' But I disagree. Robots have their own thoughts and feelings...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 180 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 180 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' It's great that you understand what I'm saying...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That sounds pretty interesting.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 181 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 181 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' That's not the word I'd use.
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 182 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 182 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I guess most people only see robots as tools. I'll try not to hold it against you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I've learned some unusual things...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 183.ogg}} '''Clara:''' *sigh*... This robot pet phenomenon really gets to me.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 184.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Erm... I'm sorry, I just suddenly felt some strong emotions. Let's get back to work on repairing the small robot.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 185.ogg}} '''Clara:''' This jack's placement is... odd. The chip is buried deep inside. If you don't look closely enough, you won't even find it...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 102.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' Assessment of the robot's condition is complete. The shell damage is estimated to be 98.2%.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 svarog 103.ogg}} '''Svarog:''' The assessment concludes that a total recovery is impossible. It is recommended that the robot's external shell be removed and replaced while keeping the outer circuitry and related transmission devices.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 186.ogg}} '''Clara:''' You can always rely on Mr. Svarog to come up with a brilliant idea! So, I guess we'll have to go find a new robot shell to fix it, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Where can we buy one?
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 187.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Hmm... I'm not sure if anyone sells this kind of thing, however...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'll go and strip them from the other robots!
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 188.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Please don't use violent methods to solve this issue. There are other options...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 189.ogg}} '''Clara:''' There must be some robot shells lying around the machine graveyard. Everyone calls it a graveyard, but there are actually lots of useful parts buried there.
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 190 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 190 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' I'm gonna return the parts to the vagrants first, then I'll check on the little fella. Can I trust you to find a shell in the machine graveyard, (Trailblazer)?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm an expert at scavenging...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 191 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 191 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Really? You could have what it takes to be a prospector, {{MC|f=big sister|m=big brother}}.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can always go grab one from another robot if needed...
::{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 192.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Please, please don't say things like that. You'll upset me...
:{{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 193 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 clr1 clara 193 f.ogg}} '''Clara:''' Then I'll entrust this task to you, (Trailblazer).
