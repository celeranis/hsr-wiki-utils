===Head to the Goethe Hotel for your appointment{{subst:void|<!--201140202-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Hotel Lobby|update|Serval invited you to have afternoon tea together at the Goethe Hotel with a clumsy excuse. After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch &mdash; You immediately realize that there is more to it.<br />No matter what, head to the Goethe Hotel and chat with Serval &mdash; Who can resist a free cup of coffee? At the very least, Serval is one of the few people in Belobog that you call your friends, no?}}

===Report back to Serval{{subst:void|<!--201140204-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|As Serval requested, you asked the opinion of the Express crew and received affirmative answers. Give this good news to Serval!}}

===Go to the Qlipoth Fort with Gepard{{subst:void|<!--201140205-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Administrative District|update|Once at the workshop, you realized Serval probably won't have her wish granted &mdash; The new Supreme Guardian Bronya at Qlipoth Fort is asking Serval to return to the army and contribute to the development of the Guards.<br />Serval could not outspeak Gepard and you in this argument and went unhappily to negotiate with the Supreme Guardian, and her concerned brother is evidently worried about her.<br />Why don't you head to Qlipoth Fort with Gepard and see how the negotiation is going.}}

===Return to the workshop with the duo{{subst:void|<!--201140210-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|You finally understood Bronya's true intentions after communicating with her &mdash; She passed a certain heirloom from Cocolia to Serval.<br />This rather flamboyant electric guitar seems to be connected to Serval and Cocolia's past. You'll need to return to the workshop and listen to Serval talking about it to know the details.}}

===Help Serval pack her things{{subst:void|<!--201140212-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|The workshop always felt as comforting as a home. As you prepare to pack up and leave here forever, this homely feeling is intensified.<br />But this is only your personal guess... What does Serval think? She is probably the only one who knows that.<br />But this has nothing to do with you. Just help her pack for now.}}
