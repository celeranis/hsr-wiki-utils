{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Hotel Lobby|update|Serval invited you to have afternoon tea together at the Goethe Hotel with a clumsy excuse. After all, there is no such thing as a free lunch &mdash; You immediately realize that there is more to it.<br />No matter what, head to the Goethe Hotel and chat with Serval &mdash; Who can resist a free cup of coffee? At the very least, Serval is one of the few people in Belobog that you call your friends, no?}}

;(Talk to Serval)
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 101.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Where did they get to?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 102.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ah, speak of the devil! I was just wondering when you might show up, hehe.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I never say no to a free afternoon tea...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 103.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Don't worry, there's enough to go around! On the house &mdash; order whatever you like.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Didn't realize you were in such a hurry... I'm not ready yet.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 104.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ready? My stomach's always ready for food and drink!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Have you placed my orders yet?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 105.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Huh? What orders?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 106.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Oops, forgot to check my messages...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 107.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Sorry, my bad... but it's not too late! You can order anything you want!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 108.ogg}} '''Serval:''' There's something I need your help with &mdash; I had to make it up to you somehow.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 109.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Looks like we're not the only ones who wanted afternoon tea today though. We'll have to stand up for the time being.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Well, I'll help myself to the tea then.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 110.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Haha, don't drink too much, or you won't be able to sleep tonight.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 111.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Anyway... about the something I needed your help with.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No need for the formalities. Let's hear it!
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 112.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Well, you're clearly better traveled than I am, and I know how generous you are... I feel embarrassed to ask now...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have my attention... as long as the afternoon tea keeps flowing.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 113.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ha, don't get ahead of yourself, this might be more complicated than you think...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Already sounds dangerous &mdash; bye!
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 114.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Wait, don't go! Take it easy, I just wanted to ask you a question...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...This "something..." is it a favor?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 115.ogg}} '''Serval:''' *sigh* Was it that obvious? I'm out of practice...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} No need for the formalities. Let's hear it!
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 116.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Well, you're clearly better traveled than I am, and I know how generous you are... I feel embarrassed to ask now...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You have my attention... as long as the afternoon tea keeps flowing.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 117.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ha, don't get ahead of yourself, this might be more complicated than you think...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} This is the price you pay for cleaning.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 118.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Uh... You still remember that?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 119.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Uh, how can I put this...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 120.ogg}} '''Serval:''' If I remember correctly, you, March, and Dan Heng came here on that train &mdash; the "Astral Express" &mdash; right?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 121.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I was wondering... is the train accepting new passengers?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Why are you asking this all of a sudden?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 122.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Well, i&mdash;it's just... the dust has settled now. The Stellaron problem has been resolved, and Cocolia...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 123.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Forget it, it's nothing! Forget I said anything.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Um... You need to pass the Boarding Exam first.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 124.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Boarding Exam? Like a test? I can do that! That sounds like the admission system that schools in Belobog use!
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 125.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I'm wondering though, are there any restrictions against, uh... "aliens" like me from boarding the train?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Such matters aren't up to me, I'm afraid I'll have to ask around first.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 126.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...I guessed as much, hehe.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 127.ogg}} '''Serval:''' You see, there's not much left for me here except to carry on repairing equipment in the workshop... I like practicing the guitar, and performances are fun, but the crowds are pretty small.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 128.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Besides, I'm a researcher... how could I not get excited about the chance to explore new worlds up close? Everyone gets tired of living in small places like Belobog after a few years, right?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I understand how you feel. Welcome aboard!
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 129.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Really? You're gonna say yes just like that?
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} ...But I'll still have to ask the others for their input first.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 130.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I understand. I'm counting on you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I can consult an expert opinion on your behalf...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 131.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Okay, okay, I&mdash;I'm counting on you!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 132.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I know this is a lot to ask out of the blue, so apologies in advance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not a problem, just leave it to me.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 133.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Haha, I knew I could count on you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Not like you to be so serious...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 134.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Hehe, this is a pretty big ask⁓
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Action speaks louder than words...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 135.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Actions? Ohhhh, I get you! Another plate of delicious snacks, coming right up!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 136.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's your sister for you.

::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 109.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Ah, sorry, my head's still in the argument. It's like this.

::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 111.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I see... no wonder she seemed so flustered. So that's what's on her mind...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 112.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Ah, sorry, my head's still in the argument. It's like this.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 113.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' As you know, my sister used to be one of the research team leads in the Silvermane Guards Technology Division. Stellarons were her main area of research.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 114.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' But her expertise went far beyond Stellarons. She was and still is well versed in mechanical engineering and other fields.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 115.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Immediately after her succession, Lady Bronya set her sights on Serval's talents. The supreme guardian wants her to resume her technological research and be a shining light for the revitalization of Belobog.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 116.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' However... you saw her attitude just now. I doubt her meeting with Lady Bronya will change anything &mdash; it'll probably just leave them both feeling dejected.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Maybe she just wants to see the outside world.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I couldn't stand an office job either...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 117.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Mm... I think there's more than one element to it.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 118.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' My intuition tells me this is mostly linked to Madam Cocolia's passing.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I thought they became enemies a long time ago?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 119.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' That's true, but...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds like you've got a story to tell. Let's hear it.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 120.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' *sigh* Never mind, it's just a personal hunch. I've never been good at reading my sister's mind.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 121.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I can tell the two of you have a close bond. If you get the chance, see if you can persuade her to open up about it.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 122.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...Hand on heart, I wouldn't want to see her sitting behind a desk in Qlipoth Fort and sighing all day either...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 123.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Belobog is too small a place for a mind as inquisitive as Serval's... Maybe it would be better for her to join you on your journey.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 124.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' *sigh* ...I'll admit, I'm a little worried about how she plans on getting all this across to Lady Bronya.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} So she was tech-savvy too?

::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 164.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Still, we hung out every day, it's only natural that my love for inventing would rub off on her.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Wait, you sure you didn't come up with that name?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 165.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Don't believe me? Let me tell you, Cocolia and I shared a similar way of thinking back in the day.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 166.ogg}} '''Serval:''' It's a bit of a mouthful, but I liked it at the time... it was a rock 'n' roll name.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 167.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...*sigh*, I told you it'd take a while to tell the story &mdash; let's get back to the workshop first. By the way... wanna help me pack my bags?

:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 172.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ah... There's no place like home. I never feel completely free out there.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 173.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Gepard, can you lend your dear sister a hand? Help me pack my bags~
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 131.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Am I allowed to refuse? This place... Just looking around gives me a headache.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 174.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Okay, okay, I promise this is the last time.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 175 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 175 f.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I'm about to go traveling with (Trailblazer) &mdash; who knows how long it'll be before I can visit home again. You should help me pack while you still have the chance.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 132.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...Fine. I'll give you a hand.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 176 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 176 f.ogg}} '''Serval:''' (Trailblazer), you just need to make yourself at home. You've done plenty of work already!

:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 169.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 170.ogg}} '''Serval:''' I didn't think many people liked that one... Seems the city might have a few nice memories of me after I'm gone.

===Help Serval pack her things{{subst:void|<!--201140212-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Neverwinter Workshop|update|The workshop always felt as comforting as a home.

:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 210 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 210 f.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Wow, great job, (Trailblazer)! Like I said &mdash; a reliable apprentice!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 211.ogg}} '''Serval:''' As promised, let me tell you the story behind this little heater.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 212.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Its original owner was an ancestor of the Landau family &mdash; Rhonda Landau. She was one of our great heroes who participated in the Defense of Belobog 700 years ago.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 213.ogg}} '''Serval:''' The records tell that during the decisive battle, she led two Silvermane Guard brigades. She engaged the enemy for four full days and nights in the fight for the city... I still have the newspaper clippings from that time &mdash; I'll show you when I get the chance.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She must have been pretty strong...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 214.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Of course, after all, she was a Landau!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think I've seen the clippings before...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 147.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' 700-year-old newspaper clippings? That... seems a little unlikely.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 148.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I'd take that with a grain of salt. Even if they do exist, odds are she lost them.
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 215 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 215 f.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ugh, the clippings aren't the point &mdash; what I'm trying to say to (Trailblazer) is that we have a lot of talent in the Landau family!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 149.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Mm &mdash; "take responsibility for your choices and the people of Belobog..." Every Landau is driven by that ethos.
----
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 216.ogg}} '''Serval:''' That should be everything...

:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 217.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Phew... finally. I think I must have left cadet school with about the same amount...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 150.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' No easy job. Serval, I want to ask you again...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 151.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Do you... really want to leave Belobog and go with the Trailblazers?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 218.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Of course! This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity &mdash; I can't miss it.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 219.ogg}} '''Serval:''' What's wrong, Gepard? Ahh, I see... Can't let go of your dear ol' sister, eh?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 152.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I... Forget it. I don't want to complicate things for you.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 153.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' But before you leave, I have one last request to make. The Garrison is heading down to the Underworld soon to survey the situation around Boulder Town. Why don't you come with me?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 220.ogg}} '''Serval:''' ...Huh? You just said you didn't wanna complicate things for me, and now you're sending me on a mission...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 221.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Ahaa~ You just wanna spend as much time as possible with me before I go, right?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 154.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 155.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' N&mdash;No, it's not that... I've heard there are a lot of old energy hubs in the Underworld, and you're probably the only person in Belobog who knows how to inspect them.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 156.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Since you're leaving one way or the other, why don't you do the people of the city one last favor before you go?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 222.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Even at a time like this, you're still thinking about the people... *sigh* I don't know what to say.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 223.ogg}} '''Serval:''' Alright, I'll help you out &mdash; the first and last time the Landau siblings will work together!
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 157 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 157 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Thanks, sis. (Trailblazer), if you have the time, could you accompany the Garrison?
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 158.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' You're Belobog's hero &mdash; I'm sure you must be popular in the Underworld. The Silvermane Guards will face less resistance if you come with us.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Of course, remember to send me a message in advance.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 159.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Thanks. I'll contact you when the Guards have finished their preparations.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 224.ogg}} '''Serval:''' *sigh* ...I'm tired of packing. Let's leave it here for today. Thanks for your help.
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 serval 225.ogg}} '''Serval:''' *yawn* I drank all that tea. Why am I getting sleepy?

;(Talk to Gepard)
:{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 160 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 160 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I'm heading back to the military zone later. (Trailblazer), do you want to go with me?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What do you think about this whole matter with Serval?
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 161.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Huh? Hmm. If you want my opinion...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 162.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' All I can say is that it's in character for her to say something and then do it without thinking. She's always been impulsive, and she doesn't mind creating a headache or two along the way...
::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 163.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' ...If she can remedy that habit during her trip with you, then I guess it will have been worth it.
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} You're sad to see her go, aren't you?
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 164.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Turns out I'm no good at hiding it...
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 165.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' *sigh* She's my sister &mdash; we grew up together. I'd be lying if I said I'm not going to miss her.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 166.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' I'm not afraid of being alone. After all, there's that, uh... communication device you gave me. If I really miss her, I can send her a message whenever I want.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 167.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' It's more that I'm worried she won't look after herself properly... Then again, with capable people like you as travel companions, I'm probably overthinking things.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 171.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' It's getting late, let's get ready to move. Is there something else you wanted to talk about?
::;(Return to previous option selection)
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I'm happy to be able to travel with her. It won't be a chore.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 168 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 168 f.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' You're... a very reliable person, (Trailblazer). Even I feel lucky to have you as her travel companion.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 169.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Still, don't underestimate her ability to drive people crazy... If at some point your crew can't take it anymore, just send her back.
:::{{A|VO Side1 ld1 gepard 170.ogg}} '''Gepard:''' Pela and I are probably the only ones in the world who know how to handle her... oh, and that assistant of hers too &mdash; Molly.
