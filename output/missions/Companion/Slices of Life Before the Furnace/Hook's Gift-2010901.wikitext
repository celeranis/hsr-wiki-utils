===Tell Hook about the auction{{subst:void|<!--201090102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|You didn't expect to find a probe for the vein detector at this auction. This is a great gift, so you decide to tell Hook about it.<br />Now you can sell the toy bear "Junjun" and buy a perfect gift. Great!}}

===Return to the clinic, find Natasha, and get the toy bear{{subst:void|<!--201090104-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Natasha's Clinic|update|To get "Junjun," you have to return to the clinic. Maybe Natasha will teach Hook another lesson.<br />But an auction is much safer than the Fragmentum, so Natasha might agree to let you go. Wait, perhaps you shouldn't reveal the truth to her...}}

===Talk to the auctioneer to learn more details{{subst:void|<!--201090105-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|To sell "Junjun" at a good price, you need to figure out the rules of this auction. Asking the auctioneer is a wise choice.<br />After all, you need to register this toy bear, and preparation is necessary if you want a decent result.}}

===Find buyers and try to sell the toy at a high price{{subst:void|<!--201090106-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|The more buyers who participate in the auction, the higher the bidding price of "Junjun."

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|The robots in this world are even smarter than humans, and one of them stole a commodity contract.<br />There is a suspicious robot in this machine graveyard. You're pretty sure you can identify it in an ocean of similar robots... if you're lucky!}}
