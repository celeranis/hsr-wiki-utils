===Ask about the details of the auction{{subst:void|<!--201090101-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|You're informed that an auction will be held by the "Wildfire" in the underworld.<br />For more details, you need to consult the auction staff in Boulder Town. Go there if you're interested.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Obtain {{Item|Used Item Auction Pamphlet|20|x=1}})

;(Talk to Auction Staff)
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 101.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Love at first sight, sold at first strike! The Wildfire used item auction is opening soon! If you're interested, head down to the vagrant camp and get involved!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 102.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Outsider! I remember you. Perhaps you're hoping to find some treasures at the auction, too?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of treasures can I find there?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No, not interested...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 103.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Don't just dash off! Let me tell you about it. I'm sure I can stoke your interest...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 104.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' We're not sticklers at this auction &mdash; you'll find everything from exotic Belobog rarities to tattered roadside socks!
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Why is Wildfire hosting an auction?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 105.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Oh after Wildfire got involved in the maintenance of the vagrant camp, they saw there was a big resource distribution problem. People would rather keep a stockpile of useless objects than exchange them for useful resources.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 106.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' So we intend to hold a public auction. It will allow folks to make the best use of the stuff they have by exchanging it for stuff they need.
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Who's going to the auction?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 107.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' It's mostly vagrants from the camp, but Boulder Town residents are welcome to join as well, of course!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 108.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' The more attendees we have, the more items there will be for trade, and the better we can meet the auction's goal!
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Talk}} How will the auction be held?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 109.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Buyers and sellers must all register their personal information. To ensure the quality of items, the sellers must also register details for each item.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 110.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Then there's the standard auction procedure. The auctioneer presents the items, and the bidders place their bids on the spot... Pretty straightforward, don't you think?
:;(Return to previous option selection)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What kind of treasures can I find at the auction?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 111.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Oh plenty! Gloves used by Chief Oleg, the domestic robot that Miss Fidora built...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 112.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' There are lots of prospectors hunting for ancient relics in the vagrant camp, so there should be a lot of unique items at this auction. For example, I heard that one of the goods up for auction is a barely used Geomarrow Probe...
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} Geomarrow Probe?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 113.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Ah, never heard of a treasure like that before, huh? More excited about the auction now?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerA 114.ogg}} '''Auction Staff:''' Oh, here &mdash; take this pamphlet. It has more information on all the rarities up for auction. Remember to stop by the vagrant camp! Be there or be square!

===Tell Hook about the auction{{subst:void|<!--201090102-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|You didn't expect to find a probe for the vein detector at this auction. This is a great gift, so you decide to tell Hook about it.<br />Now you can sell the toy bear "Junjun" and buy a perfect gift. Great!}}

;(Talk to Hook)
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 101.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ah, honorary member! I was just about to go see you!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What's up, Pitch-Dark Hook the Great?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 102.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Daddy's already planned his birthday party, but I haven't been able to sell Junjun... or buy a gift for him.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 103.ogg}} '''Hook:''' What should I do? Honorary member &mdash; you think of something!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} We should go get your dad's probe back.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 104.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ah! I was just about to ask you about the probe!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I have to tell you something first.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 105.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Huh? What's so urgent? Spit it out!
::{{DIcon|Arrow}} I know where Fersman's probe is...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 106.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Ah! How did you know what I was thinking? Hook was about to ask you about the probe!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 107.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Honorary member, you found some clues?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 108.ogg}} '''Hook:''' The auction... So... that's where the probe is!?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Do you know what "auction" means?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 109.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hmph! Do you think Hook's stupid or something?
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 110.ogg}} '''Hook:''' At the auction, I can sell Junjun AND buy a birthday gift for daddy... Yeah!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} The bad news is you'll have to compete with other bidders...
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 111.ogg}} '''Hook:''' That's nothing &mdash; you're here too! I've got the honorary member here to help me with the bidding!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 112.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Junjun is still with the old witch. Let's go get him and then register for the auction!

{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Natasha's Clinic|update|To get "Junjun," you have to return to the clinic.

::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 103.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' ...The auction, the one at the vagrant camp?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} We're going to look for Julian and play hide-and seek-with him.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 118.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Uh... yeah, that's right!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 104.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' The auction... right Hook? The one at the vagrant camp?

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Commencing plan "think of something."
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I think we should give up...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 108.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Hehe, you two make an adorable duo.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 109.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' I was only joking, Hook. Junjun is yours, and it's entirely up to you what you do with him. But you must make one promise to me...
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 120.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Wh&mdash;What is it?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 110.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Don't go charging into the Fragmentum again. Mr. Fersman heard about what you did and came to me to find out what happened.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 111.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' Your dad worries about you &mdash; stop giving him reasons to.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 121.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Daddy... Aw... Okay, I swear I'll never make Natasha or daddy worry again.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 112 m.ogg}} {{A|VO Side1 hk3 natasha 112 f.ogg}} '''Natasha:''' (Trailblazer), I'm going to have to trouble you to keep an eye on this kid again. You seem to be doing a good job, so I'll leave it at that.

:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 103.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Hm... With all due respect, I don't think this item will generate much interest at the auction... I don't see any value in it.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Actually, this bear is worth quite a lot of money.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 104.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Hm, let me take another look... The craftsmanship is excellent, and the fabric is soft... but I'm afraid that won't command a high price on its own.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Take a closer look at the eyes...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Call yourself an auctioneer?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 105.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' The eyes... wait a minute, that's natural erebus! Haha, what are precious gems doing on such an ugly teddy?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 124.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Hey, who are you calling ugly? Take that back!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 106.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Well, well, well, who'd have thought it... Allow me to make a suggestion &mdash; you should only auction off the gems.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 125.ogg}} '''Hook:''' What are you talking about? You can't just take Junjun's eyes off!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 110.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Probe? Are you talking about the Geomarrow Probe? As far as I know, there are a lot of people interested in acquiring that device. The estimated sale price is no less than 600 shield.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's a lot of money!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} That's chump change!
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 128.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Stop bluffing!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 111.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Because it's a rare and useful treasure, the Geomarrow Probe will be up for bidding in the final round of the auction.
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 112.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' But don't worry, the gems on your teddy bear are also very valuable. You'll have the chance to bid on the probe if someone's willing to pay a high price for him.

::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 113.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Oh? Then we'll be counting on you.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} He doesn't seem like he'll fetch too high a price.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 114.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' Don't be so pessimistic!
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 auctioneerB 115.ogg}} '''Auctioneer:''' I'll tell you a secret... {{Color|keyword|nobold=1|the more bidders there are, the more you can get for your bear here.}} This place is teeming with potential buyers. It only takes a gentle nudge to get them to join in.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Persuade them with true love.
::{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 130.ogg}} '''Hook:''' Is "true love" really that useful? Hee-hee!

:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 buyerB 106.ogg}} '''Gemologist:''' But it's so absurd... I don't understand why precious gems would be sewn onto a teddy bear. Is this some new kind of scam?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 hook 139.ogg}} '''Hook:''' ...So you don't think Junjun deserves those gems?
:{{A|VO Side1 hk3 buyerB 107.ogg}} '''Gemologist:''' Hehe, Junjun? Who's that?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} No one! This kid's always spouting nonsense...

::'''Elaine:''' Speaking of which, make sure you try the Iron Pot Braised Olm at the Goethe Grand Hotel.

::'''Antonia:''' But the old miners have their own ideas. They think the vagrants have made a mess of the mining team... and the vagrants aren't happy with their payment and feel that they've lost freedom... In the end, neither side is happy.
::'''Antonia:''' But I know what I am doing. This minor setback will not change my mind. Don't worry about it.

:{{DIcon|Talk}} Do you have any recommendations for activities in the underground?
::'''Antonia:''' The Fight Club is quite popular. But personally, I wouldn't pay a shield for that kind of cheap show. It's vulgar and low-class.
::'''Antonia:''' There is a restaurant, the one owned by Gertie. The food there is quite good... so long as Gertie doesn't come up with some weird recipes on a whim...
::'''Antonia:''' Also, I heard there will be a rap concert where the vagrants are? I don't know how to appreciate that kind of thing, so I've never been there. Go check it out if you are interested. Just be careful there.
