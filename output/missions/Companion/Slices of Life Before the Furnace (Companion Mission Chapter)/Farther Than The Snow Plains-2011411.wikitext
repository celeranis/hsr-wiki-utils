===Head to the Museum Finishing Room to find the Landau siblings===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You receive a message from the Landau siblings. As expected, they contacted you because they want to ask for your help, just like everyone else. Unlike the others, however, these two deliberately set up a mystery for you &mdash; They will only tell you what they need if you head to the Museum Finishing Room as they had requested.<br />Is this even the right attitude when you want to ask people for help? You don't quite know, since you were only born in the Herta Space Station a short while ago &mdash; but you must have gotten used to this random way of getting missions by now.<br />Head to the Belobog History and Culture Museum Finishing Room and listen to their request.}}

===Head to the Administrative District exit near the Outlying Snow Plains and find Lynx===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|You arrive at the Museum Finishing Room as invited, and only then learn that "sense of ceremony" was just something Serval came up with on the spot.<br />The Landau siblings express their request to you &mdash; They hope you can protect Lynx, the youngest Landau sibling, in secret. They also insist she must not discover you during the process.<br />This sounds rather odd, but you have no choice except to accept at this stage. Head to the Belobog Administrative District exit close to the Outlying Snow Plains and see what is Lynx trying to do.}}

===Head to the Snow Plains and find Lynx===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=<!--to be added-->|update|After some clandestine observation, you finally realize the "stranger" the Landau siblings are talking about is none other than everyone's friend, Miss Pela.<br />The other Landaus must have made a mistake, and the issue should be solved for now, but you don't particularly want these two girls to head out to the dangerous Outlying Snow Plains on their own. After all, you know better than anyone else just how many monsters are in the Snow Plains.<br />Help them till the end. Follow them and protect them from the shadows if needed.}}
