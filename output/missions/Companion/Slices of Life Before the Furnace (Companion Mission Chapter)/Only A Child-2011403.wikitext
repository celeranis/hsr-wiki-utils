===Meet up with the Landau siblings at the Overworld cable car===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Administrative District|update|It is about time to meet the Landau siblings. According to Gepard, you are absolutely required for this Underworld trip with the Guards &mdash; and you like hearing this.<br />As it is, why don't you go to the Overworld cable car and meet up with the Landau siblings.}}

===Head to the Boulder Town clinic===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|This is the first time that the Guards have returned to the Underworld, and the Underworld had changed greatly in the years of blockade. Criticisms for the Guards and the Supreme Guardian also swelled up throughout society there. However, the brother-sister duo of the Landau siblings and you are here to solve this problem.<br />You head to the meeting place, which is Natasha's clinic, with the Landau siblings and the Guards. The Guards from the Overworld and Wildfire from the Underworld will have a formal meeting for the first time there.}}

===Listen to the meeting between the Silvermane Guards and Wildfire===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|The two parties of the meetings have arrived. Though there are very few places to sit in the clinic, you might as well find a spot to audit this "official" meeting.}}

===Leave the clinic and see what is happening===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|The meeting was progressing smoothly until the sudden noises from outside disturbed the harmonious mood in the room. Your friends instantly rush out the door to see what is going on. "They are indeed leaders of both sides of Belobog," you think, "and I'm just here to fill the seats."<br />Complaints aside, you instinctively feel that the problems that follow might be your specialty &mdash; fighting, and saving the world on the side &mdash; anyways, head outside and check out the situation.}}

===Talk with Serval and head to the Great Mine===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|Hearing news that the Great Mine is invaded by Fragmentum monsters, the Guards and Wildfire instantly form a coalition and Gepard is already leading the vanguards to the incident site.<br />It is the duty of Trailblazers to save people &mdash; once you are ready, head out with Serval.}}
