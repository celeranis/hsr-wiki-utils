===Talk to the auctioneer and wait for the auction to begin===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|Every possible buyer at the auction can help you sell "Junjun" at a high price. Once you're ready, find the auctioneer and wait for the auction to begin.<br />Keep looking and searching, because everyone here might become a fan of "Junjun."}}

{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask the staff why the auction has been suspended===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|The auction has been suspended because of some technical issues. What issues?<br />Is the Geomarrow Probe that you and Hook have been waiting for still here?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ask for more information about this suspicious buyer===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Apart from you, there is another buyer who hasn't participated in the auction and has left. You want to learn more about this buyer.<br />Although your reasons for suspicion seem farfetched, you still think this buyer is suspicious. Why are there so many thieves here?}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to Boulder Town and find the suspect===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|Of course, the suspect came to the auction for the Geomarrow Probe. It will be too late once they've sold it off, so hurry up and catch them!<br />Wait, what's this feeling of déjà vu? Like this happened not too long ago...}}

===Get back to the auction and return the Geomarrow Probe===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|Although Hook knows she might not get the Geomarrow Probe, she decides to return it to the auction. You know that she has made up her mind.<br />This child may have told a few white lies over trivial matters, but she has a heart of gold.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Return to the clinic and ask Natasha to wrap the present===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Robot Settlement|update|With strength and a bit of luck, you get the Geomarrow Probe. Hook is not good at wrapping presents, so you have to ask for Natasha's help.<br />Perhaps Hook wants to prove herself by presenting the gift in front of Natasha.}}

:{{tx}}
{{Dialogue End}}

===Find Hook and get ready for the birthday party===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|Hook is calling her friends in the Moles.

Hook and her father's birthday party will be another happy moment for them.}}

===Return to the clinic and ask for Natasha's advice===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Boulder Town|update|You fail to get the Geomarrow Probe, but you still need to prepare a present. You ask for Natasha's advice.<br />She is well-informed and knows Fersman well. Maybe she will give you some great suggestions.}}
