{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Black Swan's Memory Bubble|This dreamscape that Black Swan has prepared is way too exciting, throwing you into a "crime scene" As soon as you enter.

:{{A|VO side3 huahuo memberA 102.ogg}} '''Bloodhound Family Member:''' In a dream, even if you're bashed a thousand times with a hammer, at worst you'll still wake up in reality in a hotel.
:{{A|VO side3 huahuo sampo 101.ogg}} '''Sampo:''' Not necessarily. Even if the result does not constitute harm, the criminal intent is... clear enough? You specifically came here to cordon off the scene because of the unsavory nature of this case, right?
:{{A|VO side3 huahuo memberA 103.ogg}} '''Bloodhound Family Member:''' You're not wrong. Even if there are no casualties, being smashed over the head with a hammer in the middle of the street for no reason at all... this is not the kind of thing that happens on Penacony.

===Inspect the unusual trashcan{{subst:void|<!--202180230-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Black Swan's Memory Bubble|update|What stands before Black Swan in this moment is undoubtedly a trashcan. A Belobogian-style trashcan. This sight is supposed to shock you, but it does not. You have seen many strange things on your journeys. This sense of being unfazed by the bizarre makes you feel like you have really gained some life experience.}}

===Figure out the answer to the puzzle{{subst:void|<!--202180247-->}}===
{{Mission Description|type=companion|location=Black Swan's Memory Bubble|update|Another murder, another play, and another puzzle. Sampo seems extremely distressed and ready to escape back into his secluded and quiet Winterland. Black Swan, on the other hand, seems calm and contented, thoroughly enjoying the detective game that Sparkle prepared. However, they are not the type to have their emotions displayed across their faces, so you are uncertain whether they are really distressed or calm.<br />However, the Dreamscape Sales Store is still a place of entertainment, so perhaps it would be better to focus on investigating the puzzle Sparkle left behind than trying to assess the true thoughts of these "characters." Let's enjoy a game of logic and deduction.}}
