;(All choices lead to the following options)
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Congratulations.
::{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 118.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Yeah, it was pretty unexpected. Space station affairs are usually handled by Lead Researcher Asta &mdash; this is the first time I've seen Madam Herta give the orders in person.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Normally she doesn't want to deal with it.
::{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 119.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Hence my "silver lining..." You know Madam Herta &mdash; if she's really interested in something, it doesn't matter what anyone else says.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} She's getting revenge on you.

:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 121.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' To put it simply, the leaders have given me an opportunity. How could I not cherish it? If I can make up for my mistakes and do a good job, I may have a chance to prove myself.
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 122.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Oh, I haven't properly explained to you what I'm doing here... As I mentioned, I'm investigating this situation.
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 123.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' This time, I plan to start from inside the space station and see if I can find some clues to trace the intruders' steps. Maybe I can find the blind spot I missed before.
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 124.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' I designed a decoding program. Look &mdash; it looks like a camera, but it's actually a detector. We should be able to find hidden clues with it.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} There seems to be an extra person...
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 159.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' But look! Just like I guessed, this graffiti is encrypted! If we decipher it, we can see some hidden information.
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 160.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' The surveillance camera captured her face &mdash; "Silver Wolf." It's exactly the same as the photo on the IPC's wanted list. Let me see what she was up to...
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 161.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Is this... a transmitter beacon? Oh, I see! She probably ran into the Antimatter Legion during the invasion, then used this beacon to teleport the enemy somewhere else.
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 162.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' We accidentally activated the beacon again just now, and they were brought back... Geez, Stellaron Hunters have the ability to stow enemies away like that?
:{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 163.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Beacon transmission that doesn't require a power source and can be implemented solely through computation? No wonder they were able to break into the space station... With this, I'm afraid not even Madam Herta's office is safe...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Don't be discouraged.
::{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 164.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' It's really hard to stay calm... Y'know, if it wasn't for you, I'd probably be lying on the ground right now.

:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Is this kind of tech really that impressive?

::{{A|VO side0 sw1 staffAG 167.ogg}} '''Leonard:''' Sounds unbelievable, doesn't it? I always thought it was fringe science, and that nobody other than the Masked Fools believed it really existed.
