;(Talk to Kafka)
:Kafka turned a blind eye to you. She mutters some words in her mouth, and these powerful words are known as "Spirit Whispers."
:{{Black Screen|You return to Kafka and Blade's hideout, and wait patiently for a while until Kafka cuts the Spirit Whisper short.}}
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 147 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 147 f.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' ...That felt like a time. It's good to open my eyes and see you back here, (Trailblazer).
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I eliminated all the monsters.
::{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 148.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Ha, inevitably so.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} How's progress on your side?
::{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 149.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Not fast enough.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What do we do now?
::{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 150.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Let me tell you...
----
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 151.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' I've weakened Blade's senses to the outside world so that he's only able to hear my voice and feel my touch &mdash; he's oblivious to everything else.
----
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 152.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' I'm going to transfer his consciousness away from the Xianzhou and cleanse his memories of Jing Yuan, Jingliu, Yingxing, and your friend Dan Heng. Again, this process mustn't be interrupted, but I can answer questions before I begin.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} My questions?
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 153.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Yes, as compensation for helping me... You don't have any questions? I put you into a deep sleep then reawakened you, abandoned you at the space station then lured you to the Xianzhou... I owe you an explanation or two &mdash; don't you want to know?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Now that you mention it...
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} I couldn't care less.
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 154.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Don't rush, we still have time. Think about it first and ask when you're ready.
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 155.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' One rule though &mdash; please don't ask anything boring...
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 156.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Let's play truth and lies!
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Truth and lies?
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} Sounds childish...
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 157.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' It's a game I play with Silver Wolf all the time &mdash; kinda psychological: Both sides ask each other two questions, then give one true answer and one false answer each.
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 158.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' So, one of my answers will be true, the other will be false. As for which is which, that's up to the asker to make the call...
:{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 159.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' We don't have much time &mdash; let's do two rounds to start. You ask me two questions, and you'll also have to answer two of mine. But remember: One truth, one lie.
:{{DIcon|Arrow}} What if both my answers are true?
::{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 160.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' Ah, that's not allowed! *sigh* The game only works when both sides follow the rules, but I'll be none the wiser if you break them. Let morality be your guide.
::{{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 161 m.ogg}} {{A|VO side2 kfk1 kafka 161 f.ogg}} '''Kafka:''' But I give you my word, (Trailblazer): I will abide by the rule of one truth, one lie.
