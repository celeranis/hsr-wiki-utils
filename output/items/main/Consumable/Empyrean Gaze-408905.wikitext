{{Description|Originally, Aquila didn't just have a hundred eyes, but countless ones like the stars. Unfortunately, Zagreus took a keen interest in Aquila's eyes and stole many of them. These eyes, blessed by Zagreus, gained the power to locate treasures. However, one must never use them in broad daylight, or they might invoke Aquila's wrathful lightning.<br /><br />''"The heavens have eyes that watch the world, but just being able to see a lot is useless when it comes to seeing through deception."''}}
