{{Description|A researcher was exercising with the Topological Acceleration Band when they saw a news report about a notorious, wealth-loathing space thief who was captured during a heist at the IPC. Inspired, the researcher negotiated with the IPC to collect fragments of the thief's memoria and enhanced the Acceleration Band, attuning it to Path Energy to guide users toward concentrations of wealth.<br /><br />''"...Pardon my bluntness, but it's even less useful for the IPC than the original Acceleration Band, as it always ends up leading straight to our own corporate ships."''}}
