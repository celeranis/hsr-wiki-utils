{{Description|A bankrupted dream-chasing tycoon concealed fragments of his dreamscape within this artifact. Its golden lips occasionally release sincere sighs and guidance. Oddly enough, though it appears to be nothing more than a stack of blocks storing phantom dreams, people keep claiming they've found real treasures with its help.<br /><br />''"Heh... Go there... That's where I hid all the treasures I spent my life chasing, only to lose them in the end..."''}}
