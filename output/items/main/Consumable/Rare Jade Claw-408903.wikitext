{{Description|In the Xianzhou Alliance, there was once a greedy heliobus named Wenye, who controlled puppets to gather wealth from all around. As punishment, the Ten-Lords Commission shattered its consciousness and sealed it within several jade hands. When a treasure is near, these jade hands twitch their index fingers, pointing toward the riches.<br /><br />''"What's yours is mine."''}}
