{{Description|A precious drink that was once considered "Celestial Ambrosia" in worldly cognition. As the cycles of Amphoreus were revealed, so did the truth of this drink. The scent wafting out of the bottle's mouth seems even more intense and sweeter than before, but imbibing is still not recommended.}}
