|description = The memory entity you carried away from a dream, in some foreign land, an artisan who admired the King and carved a puppet with heartfelt reverence. Though it seems far removed from the real King, and the craftsmanship leaves much to be desired, what heroes pass down to later generations is often just like this &mdash; crude, yet enough to soothe the soul.
